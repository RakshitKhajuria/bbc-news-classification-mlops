1,1111,what high-definition will do to dvds first it was the humble home video  then it was the dvd  and now hollywood is preparing for the next revolution in home entertainment - high-definition.  high-definition gives incredible  3d-like pictures and surround sound. the dvd disks and the gear to play them will not be out for another year or so  and there at are still a number of issues to be sorted out. but when high-definition films do come out on the new format dvds  it will profoundly change home entertainment. for rick dean  director of business development for digital content company thx  a high-definition future is an exciting prospect. he has worked on the star wars dvd trilogy  finding nemo  the incredibles and indiana jones.  there was a time not so long ago when the film world and the video world were two completely separate worlds   he told the bbc news website.   the technology we are dealing with now means they are very much conjoined.  the film that we see in theatres is coming from the same digital file that we take the home video master   he says. but currently  putting a master feature film onto dvd requires severe compression because current dvd technology cannot hold as much as high-definition films demand.  as much as you compress the picture data rate wise  you also take qualities away from the picture that we fight so hard to keep in the master   he explains.  i would love to be able to show people what projects that we worked on really look like in the high-def world and i find it very exciting.   high-definition dvds can hold up to six times more data than the dvds we are used to. it will take time though to persuade people who spent money on dvd players to buy the different players and displays required to watch high-definition dvds in 18 months  time. mr dean is confident though:  i think if they see real hd [high-definition]  not some heavily compressed version of it  there is such a remarkable difference.  i have heard comments from people who say the images pop off the screen.   high-definition will mean some changes for those working behind the scenes too. on the whole  producing films for high-definition dvds will be easier in some ways because less compression is needed. equally  it may mean hollywood studios ask for more to be put onto the average dvd.  when we master movies right now  our data rates are running at about 1.2 gigabits per second   says mr dean.  our dvds that we put out today have to be squashed down to about five or six megabits per second.  that s a huge amount of compression that has to be applied - about 98%. so if you have anything that allows more space  you don t have to compress so hard.  studios could fit a lot more marketing material  games  and features  onto high-capacity dvds. currently  an entire dvd project can take up to three months  says mr dean. although the step of down-converting will be bypassed  this will realistically only save a day s work  says mr dean. one of the most time consuming elements is building dvd navigation and menu systems. on the fairly complex star wars disks  making sure the menu buttons worked took 45 human hours alone. if studios want to cash in on the extra space  it could mean extra human hours  for which someone has to pay.  if the decision on the studio side is that they are going to put a lot more on these disks  it could be more expensive because of all the extra navigation that is required.  and if studios do focus on delivering more  added value content   thinks mr dean  ultimately it could mean that they will want more money for it. those costs could filter down to the price ticket on a high-definition dvd. but if the consumer is not willing to pay a premium price  studios will listen  thinks mr dean.  high-definition throws up other challenge to film makers and dvd production alike. more clarity on screen means film makers have to make doubly sure that attention to detail is meticulous.  when we did the first hd version of star wars episode i  everybody was very sun-tanned  but that was make-up.  in the hd version of episode i  all these make-up lines showed up   explains mr dean. the restoration of the older star wars episodes revealed some interesting items too.   there are scans of a corridor [on the death star] and fairly plainly in one of those shots  there is a file cabinet stuck behind one of the doorways.  you never used to be able to see it because things are just blurred enough during the pan that you just didn t see it.  what high-definition revolution ultimately means is that the line between home entertainment and cinema worlds will blur. with home theatre systems turning living rooms into cinemas  this line blurs even further. it could also mean that how we get films  and in what format  will widen.  in the future we are going to look towards file delivery over ip [internet protocol - broadband]  giving a dvd-like experience from the set-top box to the hard drive   says mr dean. but that is some time off for most  and for now  people still like to show off something physical in their bookshelves.,highdefinit dvd first humbl home video dvd hollywood prepar next revolut home entertain highdefinit highdefinit give incred dlike pictur surround sound dvd disk gear play anoth year still number issu sort highdefinit film come new format dvd profoundli chang home entertain rick dean director busi develop digit content compani thx highdefinit futur excit prospect work star war dvd trilog find nemo incred indiana jone time long ago film world video world two complet separ world told bbc news websit technolog deal mean much conjoin film see theatr come digit file take home video master say current put master featur film onto dvd requir sever compress current dvd technolog hold much highdefinit film demand much compress pictur data rate wise also take qualiti away pictur fight hard keep master explain would love abl show peopl project work realli look like highdef world find excit highdefinit dvd hold six time data dvd use take time though persuad peopl spent money dvd player buy differ player display requir watch highdefinit dvd month time mr dean confid though think see real hd highdefinit heavili compress version remark differ heard comment peopl say imag pop screen highdefinit mean chang work behind scene whole produc film highdefinit dvd easy way less compress need equal may mean hollywood studio ask put onto averag dvd master movi right data rate run gigabit per second say mr dean dvd put today squash five six megabit per second huge amount compress appli anyth allow space compress hard studio could fit lot market materi game featur onto highcapac dvd current entir dvd project take three month say mr dean although step downconvert bypass realist save day work say mr dean one time consum element build dvd navig menu system fairli complex star war disk make sure menu button work take human hour alon studio want cash extra space could mean extra human hour someon pay decis studio side go put lot disk could expens extra navig requir studio focu deliv ad valu content think mr dean ultim could mean want money cost could filter price ticket highdefinit dvd consum will pay premium price studio listen think mr dean highdefinit throw challeng film maker dvd product alik clariti screen mean film maker make doubli sure attent detail meticul first hd version star war episod everybodi suntan makeup hd version episod makeup line show explain mr dean restor old star war episod reveal interest item scan corridor death star fairli plainli one shot file cabinet stuck behind one doorway never use abl see thing blur enough pan see highdefinit revolut ultim mean line home entertain cinema world blur home theatr system turn live room cinema line blur even could also mean get film format widen futur go look toward file deliveri ip internet protocol broadband give dvdlike experi settop box hard drive say mr dean time peopl still like show someth physic bookshelv
2,1273,vera drake s bafta triumph hope at the bafta film awards on saturday night  there is the prospect that a home-grown movie could walk off with a clutch of trophies.  vera drake  mike leigh s tale about a 1950s backstreet abortionist  is nominated in 11 categories. these include best film  best director and best actress shortlist for imelda staunton who plays the eponymous character. the film has spent months being lauded with prizes  from the venice film festival to five awards from the london critics  circle on wednesday night.  the baftas has a tradition of honouring british cinema  and this year vera drake is the obvious candidate to be heaped with praise. empire magazine s reviews editor dan jolin said the film had  a very good chance  of doing well on saturday  predicting that it would collect five or six awards.  i don t think it s going to do a lord of the rings-style sweep  but imelda staunton is a shoo-in for best actress   he said.   a best director prize for mike leigh and best british film are also likely and it could steal some awards from heavily-nominated competitors the aviator and finding neverland.  mr jolin tipped another contender - most likely the aviator - to walk away with the bafta for best film  and added that finding neverland had been lavished with nominations but not trophies. strong oscar contenders million dollar baby and sideways did not figure in the bafta nominations  giving vera drake greater potential to walk away with the big prizes.   there is a sense that this film is ours and we should slap our own guys on the back. out of all the films in the running for the baftas  vera drake is the true blue british one.    if mike leigh is going to win awards for anything  it should be vera drake at this year s baftas   said mr jolin  adding that the film was probably his most technically accomplished and lavish work yet. mr jolin also tipped phil davis for a best supporting actor prize for his role in vera drake but felt that heather craney could be outdone by kate winslet or natalie portman in the supporting actress category.  if there is anywhere where this film is going to win  it will be at the baftas   he said.  the guardian s film critic peter bradshaw felt that there  might well be  a sweep of awards for vera drake on saturday night.  i hope that bafta voters will respond to the extremely high standard of acting from the whole cast of the film. if bafta can t do so  what hope is there   he said. mr bradshaw felt that mike leigh s  masterpiece  was entitled to the best film award - leaving dead man s shoes  harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban  my summer of love and shaun of the dead to slug it out for the best british film trophy.  i will be cheering if vera drake wins a whole host of awards   he added.,vera drake bafta triumph hope bafta film award saturday night prospect homegrown movi could walk clutch trophi vera drake mike leigh tale s backstreet abortionist nomin categori includ best film best director best actress shortlist imelda staunton play eponym charact film spent month laud prize venic film festiv five award london critic circl wednesday night bafta tradit honour british cinema year vera drake obviou candid heap prais empir magazin review editor dan jolin say film good chanc well saturday predict would collect five six award think go lord ringsstyl sweep imelda staunton shooin best actress say best director prize mike leigh best british film also like could steal award heavilynomin competitor aviat find neverland mr jolin tip anoth contend like aviat walk away bafta best film ad find neverland lavish nomin trophi strong oscar contend million dollar babi sideway figur bafta nomin give vera drake great potenti walk away big prize sen film slap guy back film run bafta vera drake true blue british one mike leigh go win award anyth vera drake year bafta say mr jolin ad film probabl technic accomplish lavish work yet mr jolin also tip phil davi best support actor prize role vera drake felt heather craney could outdon kate winslet natali portman support actress categori anywher film go win bafta say guardian film critic peter bradshaw felt might well sweep award vera drake saturday night hope bafta voter respond extrem high standard act whole cast film bafta hope say mr bradshaw felt mike leigh masterpiec entitl best film award leav dead man shoe harri potter prison azkaban summer love shaun dead slug best british film trophi cheer vera drake win whole host award ad
3,174,commons hunt protest charges eight protesters who stormed the house of commons chamber during a debate on the hunting bill have been charged with disorderly conduct.  the men were arrested in september after bursting into the chamber causing a hunting ban debate to be halted. those charged included otis ferry  the 22-year-old son of rock star bryan ferry and luke tomlinson  27  a close friend of princes william and harry. they were charged under section 5 of the public order act  police said.  five of the eight men held an impromptu news conference outside charing cross police station on monday evening  after the charges were formerly put to them. the men s solicitor matthew knight  said that at no time had it occurred to the men that they were committing a criminal offence.   there is no offence of trespassing in the house of commons - it is not a criminal offence   he said.  if parliament wanted to make entering the house of commons chamber on foot a criminal offence it should have done so  but it can t do so retrospectively.  we are not prosecuted for that. we are prosecuted for a public order act offence. we are not guilty of it.  they will appear at bow street magistrates  court on 21 december  a police spokesman said. otis ferry  a former eton pupil and joint leader of the south shropshire hunt  said:  i have no regrets.  we have done nothing wrong beyond the obvious which was to stand up for our rights and not act like a sheep like the rest of the country.  one of the men  david redvers  34  from hartpury  gloucestershire  said he and the other seven protesters would plead not guilty to the charges.  the other protesters are john holliday  37  a huntsman from ledbury  herefordshire  robert thame  34  who plays polo with princes charles in team highgrove  auctioneer andrew elliot  42  from bromesberrow  near ledbury  point-to-point jockey richard wakeham  34  from york  and former royal chef nick wood  41. the 15 september protest came on the same day as a huge pro-hunting demonstration in parliament square. four of the men ran out from behind the speaker s chair while another wrestled past a doorkeeper from a different entrance. the five tried to confront mps before they were bundled out of the chamber and later led away handcuffed by police. three others had been intercepted by security staff as they tried to join the five in the chamber.  speaker michael martin later said the men had used a forged letter to gain access to the house of commons and had been helped to get close to the chamber by a parliamentary pass holder. in november  the use of the parliament act meant a total ban on hunting with dogs in england and wales. however  many pro-hunt activists remained defiant after the law was passed  saying they would ignore the ban and continue to hunt. last week  the countryside alliance said more than 250 hunts would meet legally the day after the ban on hunting with dogs comes into force. the alliance said the 19 february meets would show the new law was  impossibly difficult to determine  and open to different interpretations.,common hunt protest charg eight protest storm hous common chamber debat hunt bill charg disorderli conduct men arrest septemb burst chamber caus hunt ban debat halt charg includ oti ferri yearold son rock star bryan ferri luke tomlinson close friend princ william harri charg section public order act polic say five eight men held impromptu news confer outsid chare cross polic station monday even charg formerli put men solicitor matthew knight say time occur men commit crimin offenc offenc trespass hous common crimin offenc say parliament want make enter hous common chamber foot crimin offenc do retrospect prosecut prosecut public order act offenc guilti appear bow street magistr court decemb polic spokesman say oti ferri former eton pupil joint leader south shropshir hunt say regret do noth wrong beyond obviou stand right act like sheep like rest countri one men david redver hartpuri gloucestershir say seven protest would plead guilti charg protest john holliday huntsman ledburi herefordshir robert thame play polo princ charl team highgrov auction andrew elliot bromesberrow near ledburi pointtopoint jockey richard wakeham york former royal chef nick wood septemb protest come day huge prohunt demonstr parliament squar four men ran behind speaker chair anoth wrestl past doorkeep differ entranc five tri confront mp bundl chamber later lead away handcuf polic three other intercept secur staff tri join five chamber speaker michael martin later say men use forg letter gain access hous common help get close chamber parliamentari pas holder novemb use parliament act meant total ban hunt dog england wale howev mani prohunt activist remain defiant law pas say would ignor ban continu hunt last week countrysid allianc say hunt would meet legal day ban hunt dog come forc allianc say februari meet would show new law imposs difficult determin open differ interpret
4,605,da vinci code is  lousy history  the plot of an international bestseller that thousands of readers are likely to receive as a christmas present is  laughable   a clergyman has said.  the da vinci code claims jesus was not crucified  but married mary magdalene and died a normal death. it claims this was later covered up by the church. the bishop of durham  the rt rev dr tom wright  described the novel as a  great thriller  but  lousy history . the book has sold more than seven million copies worldwide. despite enjoying dan brown s conspiracy theory  the bishop said there was a lack of evidence to back up its claims.  writing his christmas message in the northern echo  the bishop said:  conspiracy theories are always fun - fun to invent  fun to read  fun to fantasise about.  dan brown is the best writer i ve come across in the genre  but anyone who knows anything about 1st century history will see that this underlying material is laughable.  a great deal of credible evidence proves the biblical version of jesus  life was true  according to the bishop.  the evidence for jesus and the origins of christianity is astonishingly good   he said.  we have literally a hundred times more early manuscripts for the gospels and letters in the new testament than we have for the main classical authors like cicero  virgil and tacitus.   historical research shows that they present a coherent and thoroughly credible picture of jesus  with all sorts of incidental details that fit the time when he lived  and don t fit the world of later legend.  brown s book has become a publishing phenomenon  consistently topping book charts in the uk and us. the da vinci code has been translated into 42 languages and has spawned its own cottage industry of publications  including guides on to how to read the book  rebuttals and counter claims. the book  which has become an international best-seller in little over two years  is set to be made into a film starring tom hanks.,da vinci code lousi histori plot intern bestsel thousand reader like receiv christma present laughabl clergyman say da vinci code claim jesu crucifi marri mari magdalen die normal death claim later cover church bishop durham rt rev dr tom wright describ novel great thriller lousi histori book sell seven million copi worldwid despit enjoy dan brown conspiraci theori bishop say lack evid back claim write christma messag northern echo bishop say conspiraci theori alway fun fun invent fun read fun fantasis dan brown best writer come across genr anyon know anyth st centuri histori see underli materi laughabl great deal credibl evid prove biblic version jesu life true accord bishop evid jesu origin christian astonishingli good say liter hundr time earli manuscript gospel letter new testament main classic author like cicero virgil tacitu histor research show present coher thoroughli credibl pictur jesu sort incident detail fit time live fit world later legend brown book becom publish phenomenon consist top book chart uk u da vinci code translat languag spawn cottag industri public includ guid read book rebutt counter claim book becom intern bestsel littl two year set make film star tom hank
5,256,mps criticise child access system divorced parents seeking access to their children are often disadvantaged by the legal system  mps have said.  the constitutional affairs select committee said parents with custody could exploit delays in the system to stop former partners gaining access. courts should be used as a last resort  but where they are  their orders should be enforced more rigorously  mps said. but they rejected the claim made by some campaign groups that there should be a legal presumption of equal access.  currently the presumption is that the interests of the child are paramount.  an arbitrary  template  imposed on all families  whatever the needs of the child  would relegate the welfare of individual children to a secondary position   the mps said.  they said the law should be changed to require family courts specifically to take account of the importance of sustaining the relationship between the child and the non-resident parent in contested cases. this would  reassert the rights of non-resident parents to contact with their children  as well as the rights of children to contact with both their parents  while maintaining sufficient flexibility to cope with issues of safety   they said. delays in court hearings and the inability to effectively enforce court orders allowed  a new  status quo  arrangement for the children to become established by default   they said.   although the courts rigorously avoid conscious bias  there are considerable grounds for accepting that non-resident parents are frequently disadvantaged by the system as it is administered at present.  given the strong animosity between the parties which is common in contested family cases  we find it hard to believe that tactical delay is not sometimes used to the advantage of resident parents.  committee chairman alan beith said the five-month inquiry had been a  complex and emotive  one.  at the moment  far too many contact and residency cases are being dealt with by the courts when they could be better resolved through professional mediation and negotiation   he said.  this situation has to change. the court system should only be used as a last resort  where mediation and negotiation have completely broken down or where issues of abuse or domestic violence need to be dealt with.  this will help to reduce delays and improve the lives of many children across the country.,mp criticis child access system divorc parent seek access child often disadvantag legal system mp say constitut affair select committe say parent custodi could exploit delay system stop former partner gain access court use last resort order enforc rigor mp say reject claim make campaign group legal presumpt equal access current presumpt interest child paramount arbitrari templat impos famili whatev need child would releg welfar individu child secondari posit mp say say law chang requir famili court specif take account import sustain relationship child nonresid parent contest case would reassert right nonresid parent contact child well right child contact parent maintain suffici flexibl cope issu safeti say delay court hear inabl effect enforc court order allow new statu quo arrang child becom establish default say although court rigor avoid consciou bia consider ground accept nonresid parent frequent disadvantag system administ present give strong animos parti common contest famili case find hard believ tactic delay sometim use advantag resid parent committe chairman alan beith say fivemonth inquiri complex emot one moment far mani contact resid case dealt court could well resolv profession mediat negoti say situat chang court system use last resort mediat negoti complet broken issu abus domest violenc need dealt help reduc delay improv live mani child across countri

7,566,howard attacks  pay later  budget tory leader michael howard has dismissed gordon brown s budget as  vote now  pay later  spending plans.  the simple fact was that under a new labour government taxes would go up after the election to plug a financial black hole  mr howard said. everyone could see the chancellor s  sweeteners   but these hid tax rises for hard working families  he said. labour s  faltering election campaign  would not be helped by the package of measures  mr howard added.  mr brown s budget was not about what was good for the country  but  all about the interests of the labour party   the tory leader said after mockingly welcoming the chancellor back to the election campaign. he went on to accuse mr brown of giving with one hand while taking away with the other. he urged the chancellor to admit he had been responsible for dragging  millions of people in to the net  to pay stamp duty and inheritance tax.  we can all see the sweeteners  but they hide the crippling tax rises for hard-working families that are inevitable if labour wins.   he also accused the government and the chancellor of running out of solutions to the problems britain faced.  their only answer is to tax  to spend and to waste - to get people to vote now and pay later.  mr brown liked to rattle off  magical balances conjured out of thin air  in a bid to convince people there was no  black hole  in the nation s finances  the tory leader said.  this dodgy government that brought us the dodgy dossier is now publishing a dodgy budget based on dodgy numbers   he said.  you now propose to borrow  over the next six years  no less than £168 billion; so much for prudence.  the chancellor s forecasts of surpluses are no better than the prime minister s forecasts of weapons of mass destruction.   mr brown s council tax rebate for pensioners was £300 less than what the tories were offering  mr howard said. there was nothing in the budget that would put more police on the streets  make hospitals cleaner or give parents and teachers the discipline and skills they wanted in schools. people would face a  clear choice  at the election  either  more waste and higher taxes under labour or lower taxes and value for money with the conservatives   he said.  that s the battleground of this election. that s what this election is going to be all about and i say bring it on   he concluded  to loud tory cheering.,howard attack pay later budget torus leader michael howard dismiss gordon brown budget vote pay later spend plan simpl fact new labour govern tax would go elect plug financi black hole mr howard say everyon could see chancellor sweeten hid tax rise hard work famili say labour falter elect campaign would help packag measur mr howard ad mr brown budget good countri interest labour parti torus leader say mockingli welcom chancellor back elect campaign go accus mr brown give one hand take away urg chancellor admit respons drag million peopl net pay stamp duti inherit tax see sweeten hide crippl tax rise hardwork famili inevit labour win also accus govern chancellor run solut problem britain face answer tax spend wast get peopl vote pay later mr brown like rattl magic balanc conjur thin air bid convinc peopl black hole nation financ torus leader say dodgi govern brought u dodgi dossier publish dodgi budget base dodgi number say propos borrow next six year less £ billion much prudenc chancellor forecast surplus well prime minist forecast weapon mass destruct mr brown council tax rebat pension £ less torus offer mr howard say noth budget would put polic street make hospit cleaner give parent teacher disciplin skill want school peopl would face clear choic elect either wast high tax labour low tax valu money conserv say battleground elect elect go say bring conclud loud torus cheer
8,1186,rich pickings for hi-tech thieves viruses  trojans and other malicious programs sent on to the net to catch you out are undergoing a subtle change.  the shift is happening as tech savvy criminals turn to technology to help them con people out of cash  steal valuable data or take over home pcs. viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are getting rarer. instead programs are now crafted for directly criminal ends and firms are tightening up networks with defences to combat the new wave of malicious code.  the growing criminal use of malware has meant the end of the neat categorisation of different sorts of viruses and malicious programs. before now it has been broadly possible to name and categorise viruses by the method they use to spread and how they infect machines. but many of the viruses written by criminals roll lots of technical tricks together into one nasty package.   you cannot put them in to the neat little box that you used to   said pete simpson  head of the threat laboratory at security firm clearswift. now viruses are just as likely to spread by themselves like worms  or to exploit loopholes in browsers or hide in e-mail message attachments.  it s about outright criminality now   said mr simpson  explaining why this change has come about. he said many of the criminal programs came from eastern europe where cash-rich organised gangs can find a ready supply of technical experts that will crank out code to order. former virus writer marek strihavka  aka benny from the 29a virus writing group  recently quit the malware scene partly because it was being taken over by spyware writers  phishing gangs  and spammers who are more interested in money rather than the technology. no longer do virus writers produce programs to show off their technical prowess to rivals in the underground world of malware authors. not least  said paul king  principal security consultant at cisco  because the defences against such attacks are so common.  in many ways the least likely way to do it is e-mail because most of us have got anti-virus and firewalls now   he said. few of the malicious programs written by hi-tech thieves are cleverly written  many are much more pragmatic and use tried and tested techniques to infect machines or to trick users into installing a program or handing over important data.  if you think of criminals they do not do clever   said mr king   they just do what works.   as the tactics used by malicious programs change  said mr king  so many firms were changing the way they defend themselves. now many scan machines that connect to the corporate networks to ensure they have not been compromised while off the core network.  many will not let a machine connect and a worker get on with their job before the latest patches and settings have been uploaded. as well as using different tactics  criminals also use technology for reasons that are much more transparent.  the main motivation now is money   said gary stowell  spokesman for st bernard software. mr stowell said organised crime gangs were turning to computer crime because the risks of being caught were low and the rates of return were very high. with almost any phishing or spyware attack  criminals are guaranteed to catch some people out and have the contacts to exploit what they recover. so-called spyware was proving very popular with criminals because it allowed them to take over machines for their own ends  to steal key data from users or to hijack web browsing sessions to point people at particular sites. in some cases spyware was being written that searched for rival malicious programs on pcs it infects and then trying to erase them so it has sole ownership of that machine.,rich pick hitech thiev virus trojan malici

15,518,ireland 17-12 south africa ronan o gara scored all ireland s points as the home side claimed only their second ever win over south africa on an emotional day at lansdowne road.  o gara s first-half try  poached after a quick tap-penalty  helped the irish to a 8-3 lead at half-time. three further o gara penalties extended ireland s lead to 17-6 as the game entered the final quarter. two percy montgomery penalties set up a frantic finish but ireland held out to claim a famous victory. ireland began strongly and were never led  but the match was tense and closely fought throughout. aware of the threat posed by the south africans  ireland pressed hard from the outset  and played some impressive rugby while searching for a breakthrough. early on  denis hickie thought he was in for a try after a delightful backline move but shane horgan s pass was adjudged to have gone forward by referee paul honiss.  ireland continued to press and they showed their intent by opting for a line-out in the 19th minute when three straight-forward points were on offer. another south african infringement a minute later led to ireland s first points - o gara took a quick tap-penalty and charged over the opposition line for an irish try. the springboks could feel hard done by as captain john smit had his back to the play when o gara pounced after referee honiss had told the skipper to warn his own players after consistent infringements. stung by the score  the south africans almost replied with a try of their own within 60 seconds with geordan murphy s ankle-tap tackle denying a certain try for percy montgomery. however  the springboks did win a penalty a minute later which montgomery easily slotted to cut ireland s lead to 5-3.  ireland got out of jail when the south africans had a three-to-one overlap near the irish line only to waste the chance. after the sustained springboks pressure  the irish produced an attack of their own in the 34th minute which culminated with o gara s clever drop-goal to restore his side s lead to five points which remained the margin at half-time. sustained irish pressure immediately after half-time was rewarded by another o gara penalty. however  montgomery responded quickly by slotting over a superb penalty from near the right touchline to cut ireland s lead to five points again. montgomery then burst through the irish defence in the 48th minute and it took a superb girvan dempsey tackle to prevent a try. the south africans suffered a double-blow in the 52nd minute when schalk burger was sin-binned for the second week in a row after killing the ball and o gara punished the transgression by notching another penalty.  in the 61st minute  hickie was left frustrated by a poor pass from girvan dempsey as a chance to seal the match was wasted. however  a late tackle on brian o driscoll enabled o gara to notch another penalty in the 63rd minute which extended ireland s lead to 17-6. however  two montgomery penalties had ireland s lead in peril again as the springboks closed to within five points with seven minutes remaining. south africa produced a huge effort in the closing minutes but ireland held on to claim a deserved victory.  g dempsey;

26,754,italy aim to rattle england italy coach john kirwan believes his side can upset england as the six nations wooden spoon battle hots up.  the two sides  both without a win  meet on 12 march at twickenham and kirwan says his side will be hoping to make the most of england s current slump.  we have to make sure the england and france games are tough for them.  england have not been having the best of championships. that is a big one for us and them and i am sure my players will rise to the occasion   he said. but kirwan admits that a lot of hard work will be needed with his kickers before the trip to london. roland de marigny and luciano orquera had a miserable time with the boot in the dire defeat to scotland as chris paterson stole the show to give the hosts a much-needed 18-10 victory. kirwan said:  the kicking was the decisive factor in scotland which cost us and it could go down to the kicking again next time.  but i have a lot of confidence in my players and i am positive we can put everything together against england.  england  meanwhile  are licking their wounds and rueing what might have been had two decisions from referee jonathan kaplan not gone against them in the second half in dublin. first mark cueto was judged offside as he chased fly-half charlie hodgson s kick  and then kaplan opted not to call upon video evidence to see if josh lewsey had touched down after being driven over ireland s line.  but centre jamie noon believes the side at least showed better form than their previous two defeats.  we definitely improved against an in-form irish side   he said.  we went to dublin quietly confident that we would be able to compete  and i think we showed that.  we have got to make sure we now take the form and positives into the italy game. we are under no illusions that it is going to be easy  but we definitely need a win.  england have now equalled an 18-year low of four successive championship defeats  including france in paris last season  and have lost four in a row under andy robinson. his predecessor  sir clive woodward  began his seven-year reign with three defeats and two draws.,itali aim rattl england itali coach john kirwan believ side upset england six nation wooden spoon battl hot two side without win meet march twickenham kirwan say side hope make england current slump make sure england franc game tough england best championship big one u sure player rise occas say kirwan admit lot hard work need kicker trip london roland de marigni luciano orquera miser time boot dire defeat scotland chri paterson stole show give host muchneed victori kirwan say kick decis factor scotland cost u could go kick next time lot confid player posit put everyth togeth england england meanwhil lick wound rue might two decis refere jonathan kaplan go second half dublin first mark cueto judg offsid chase flyhalf charli hodgson kick kaplan opt call upon video evid see josh lewsey touch driven ireland line centr jami noon believ side least show well form previou two defeat definit improv inform irish side say go dublin quietli confid would abl compet think show get make sure take form posit itali game illus go easi definit need win england equal year low four success championship defeat includ franc pari last season lose four row andi robinson predecessor sir clive woodward begin sevenyear reign three defeat two draw
27,1364,calder fears for scottish rugby former scotland international finlay calder fears civil war at the sru could seriously hamper his country s rbs six nations campaign.  four members of the executive board  including the chairman  david mackay  have resigned after a simmering row. and calder said:  this is terrible news for every level of scottish rugby.  david is a successful businessman and i thought that if anybody could transform the negative atmosphere and rising debt level  it was him.  mackay s executive board has been in a power struggle with the general committee  which contains members elected by scotland s club sides.  he has been driven out by people who seem happier waging civil war than addressing the central issue that professional rugby can t be run by amateurs   said calder.   in fact  i don t understand why we are still having this argument 10 years after professionalism arrived.  but i don t believe the rest of the sru will take this lying down.  i think the banks will be dismayed at this decision and  ultimately  it is them who pull the strings.  so i wouldn t be surprised if they reviewed their position. but  in the wider picture  what message does this send out   he thought the work of scotland s coaches  who have been attempting to arrest the decline of the national side  would be made much more difficult.  matt williams and willie anderson must be wondering   what have we walked into here    said calder.  and we can now expect weeks of arguments and acrimony just at a time when we should be looking forward to the six nations championship.  i am very  very disappointed  more than you can imagine. why do so many scots have this knack of turning on each other when the going gets tough,calder fear scottish rugbi former scotland intern finlay calder fear civil war sru could serious hamper countri rb six nation campaign four member execut board includ chairman david mackay resign simmer row calder say terribl news everi level scottish rugbi david success businessman thought anybodi could transform neg atmospher rise debt level mackay execut board power struggl gener committe contain member elect scotland club side driven peopl seem happier wage civil war address central issu profession rugbi run amateur say calder fact understand still argument year profession arriv believ rest sru take lie think bank dismay decis ultim pull string surpris review posit wider pictur messag send thought work scotland coach attempt arrest declin nation side would make much difficult matt william willi anderson must wonder walk say calder expect week argument acrimoni time look forward six nation championship disappoint imagin mani scot knack turn go get tough

29,740,labour s election love-in peace and love have been in short supply in the labour party in recent days.  if press reports are to be believed  alan milburn and gordon brown have been at each other s throats over the contents of labour s next election manifesto. but the pair were all smiles on tuesday morning  as they joined john prescott to unveil labour s latest poster campaign. the event - at old billingsgate fish market on the banks of the thames - was a carefully choreographed show of unity. and the surest sign yet that we are heading for a general election in the next few months. it was also one of the most bizarre photo opportunities of recent years.  the first inkling something slightly odd was afoot was when - in place of the soft rock music normally chosen for such occasions - labour s speakers crackled to life with the sound of booker t and the mgs. then a vw camper van trundled into view  decked out in that most mind-bending of psychedelic messages -  lowest mortgage rate for 40 years . as the side-door slid open  it looked for one glorious moment as if the cabinet had decided to bury their differences and go on the road together  scooby doo-style. but  sadly  it wasn t the cabinet who had raided the dressing-up box - just six rather ill-at-ease looking labour students. two were dressed as regency dandies - to unveil a poster trumpeting  the longest period of economic growth for 200 years . another pair of students were in a beatle wig and sgt pepper jacket to highlight the  lowest interest rates since the 1960s .  the remaining two were dressed in a vague approximation of disco chic to demonstrate the  lowest unemployment since the seventies .  the politicians - led out by john prescott - were soberly-suited as always. the event may have been designed to highlight labour s economic success under mr brown  but there was little doubt who was in charge. the chancellor walked side-by-side with mr milburn  pointedly exchanging chit chat  as they approached the microphone. but it was mr milburn who took centre stage  speaking of the  positive campaign  the party hoped to stage in the  coming weeks and months .  the mobile poster vans would  let people know britain is working again . mr brown repeated the familiar mantras displayed on the posters and spoke of labour s  shared purpose  and  united dedication . it was left to mr prescott to pay glowing tribute to the chancellor s record and  in a final flourish  to produce his famous pledge card  from 1997  claiming labour has met all of its promises. the event was carefully stage-managed to underline cabinet unity. and  more specifically  to demonstrate the  central role  mr brown will play in the election campaign  despite being sidelined as campaign chief in favour of mr milburn.  but keen students of body language will have had a field day. there was much forced smiling for the cameras  but only mr prescott  who revels in such occasions  seemed to be truly enjoying himself. mr milburn made a point of turning to face the chancellor  as he spoke  nodding thoughtfully. but it was the former health secretary s final gesture  placing an arm on mr brown s back as they walked away from the microphones  which was perhaps the most telling. thanks for dropping by gordon  he might have been saying.,labour elect lovein peac love short suppli labour parti recent day press report believ alan milburn gordon brown throat content labour next elect manifesto pair smile tuesday morn join john prescott unveil labour late poster campaign event old billingsg fish market bank thame care choreograph show uniti surest sign yet head gener elect next month also one bizarr photo opportun recent year first inkl someth slightli odd afoot place soft rock music normal chosen occas labour speaker crackl life sound booker mg vw camper van trundl view deck mindbend psychedel messag low mortgag rate year sidedoor slid open look one gloriou moment cabinet decid buri differ go road togeth scoobi doostyl sadli cabinet raid dressingup box six rather illateas look labour student two dress regenc dandi unveil poster trumpet long period econom growth year anoth pair student beatl wig sgt pepper jacket highlight low interest rate sinc s remain two dress vagu approxim disco chic demonstr low unemploy sinc seventi politician lead john prescott soberlysuit alway event may design highlight labour econom success mr brown littl doubt charg chancellor walk sidebysid mr milburn pointedli exchang chit chat approach microphon mr milburn take centr stage speak posit campaign parti hope stage come week month mobil poster van would let peopl know britain work mr brown repeat familiar mantra display poster spoke labour share purpos unit dedic left mr prescott pay glow tribut chancellor record final flourish produc famou pledg card claim labour met promis event care stagemanag underlin cabinet uniti specif demonstr central role mr brown play elect campaign despit sidelin campaign chief favour mr milburn keen student bodi languag field day much forc smile camera mr prescott revel occas seem truli enjoy mr milburn make point turn face chancellor spoke nod thought former health secretari final gestur place arm mr brown back walk away microphon perhap tell thank drop gordon might say

32,334,ecb holds rates amid growth fears the european central bank has left its key interest rate unchanged at 2% for the 19th month in succession.  borrowing costs have remained on hold amid concerns about the strength of economic growth in the 12 nations sharing the euro  analysts said. despite signs of pick-up  labour markets and consumer demand remain sluggish  while firms are eyeing cost cutting measures such as redundancies. high oil prices  meanwhile  have put upward pressure on the inflation rate.  surveys of economists have shown that the majority expect borrowing costs to stay at 2% in coming months  with an increase of a quarter of a percentage point predicted some time in the second half of the year. if anything  there may be greater calls for an interest rate cut  especially with the euro continuing to strengthen against the dollar.  the euro land economy is still struggling with this recovery   said economist dirk schumacher. the ecb  may sound rather hawkish but once the data allows them to cut again  they will.  data coming out of germany on thursday underlined the problems facing european policy makers. while germany s economy expanded by 1.7% in 2004  growth was driven by export sales and lost some of its momentum in the last three months of the year.  the strength of the euro is threatening to dampen that foreign demand in 2005  and domestic consumption currently is not strong enough to take up the slack. inflation in the eurozone  however  is estimated at about 2.3% in december  above ecb guidelines of 2%. ecb president jean-claude trichet has remained upbeat about prospects for the region  and inflation is expected to drop below 2% later in 2005. the ecb has forecast economic growth in the eurozone of 1.9% in 2005.,ecb hold rate amid growth fear european central bank left key interest rate unchang th month success borrow cost remain hold amid concern strength econom growth nation share euro analyst say despit sign pickup labour market consum demand remain sluggish firm eye cost cut measur redund high oil price meanwhil put upward pressur inflat rate survey economist show major expect borrow cost stay come month increas quarter percentag point predict time second half year anyth may great call interest rate cut especi euro continu strengthen dollar euro land economi still struggl recoveri say economist dirk schumach ecb may sound rather hawkish data allow cut data come germani thursday underlin problem face european polici maker germani economi expand growth driven export sale lose momentum last three month year strength euro threaten dampen foreign demand domest consumpt current strong enough take slack inflat eurozon howev estim decemb ecb guidelin ecb presid jeanclaud trichet remain upbeat prospect region inflat expect drop later ecb forecast econom growth eurozon

35,1259,honda wins china copyright ruling japan s honda has won a copyright case in beijing  further evidence that china is taking a tougher line on protecting intellectual property rights.  a court ruled that chongqing lifan industry group must stop selling honda brand motorbikes and said it must pay 1.47m yuan ($177 600) in compensation. internationally recognized regulation is now a key part of china s plans for developing its economy  analysts said. beijing also has been threatened with sanctions if it fails to clamp down.  chinese firms copy products ranging from computer software and spark plugs to baby milk and compact discs. despite the fact that product piracy is a major problem  foreign companies have only occasionally won cases and the compensation awarded has usually been small. still  recent rulings and announcements will have boosted optimism that attitudes are changing. earlier this week china said that in future it will punish violators of intellectual property rights with up to seven years in jail. and on tuesday  paws incorporated - the owner of the rights to garfield the cat - won a court battle against a publishing house that violated its copyright. other firms that have taken legal action in china  with varying degrees of success  include yamaha  general motors and toyota.  the problem of piracy is not limited to china  however  and the potential for profit is huge. the european union estimates that the global trade in pirated wares is worth more than 200bn euros a year (£140bn; $258bn)  or about 5% of total world trade. and it is growing. between 1998 and 2002  the number of counterfeit or pirated goods intercepted at the eu s external borders increased by more than 800%  it said. last month the eu said it will start monitoring china  ukraine and russia to ensure they are going after pirated goods. other countries on the eu s hit list include thailand  brazil  south korea and indonesia. any countries that are not making enough of an effort could be dragged to the world trade organisation (wto)  a step that could trigger economic sanctions  the eu warned.,honda win china copyright rule japan honda copyright case beij evid china take tougher line protect intellectu properti right court rule chongq lifan industri group must stop sell honda brand motorbik say must pay m yuan compens intern recogn regul key part china plan develop economi analyst say beij also threaten sanction fail clamp chine firm copi product rang comput softwar spark plug babi milk compact disc despit fact product piraci major problem foreign compani occasion case compens award usual small still recent rule announc boost optim attitud chang earlier week china say futur punish violat intellectu properti right seven year jail tuesday paw incorpor owner right garfield cat court battl publish hous violat copyright firm take legal action china vari degre success includ yamaha gener motor toyota problem piraci limit china howev potenti profit huge european union estim global trade pirat ware worth bn euro year £bn bn total world trade grow number counterfeit pirat good intercept eu extern border increas say last month eu say start monitor china ukrain russia ensur go pirat good countri eu hit list includ thailand brazil south korea indonesia countri make enough effort could drag world trade organis wto step could trigger econom sanction eu warn

37,967,italy to get economic action plan italian prime minister silvio berlusconi will unveil plans aimed at kickstarting the country s sputtering economy on thursday night in rome.  he will present an  action plan for the development of italy  in a meeting with industrialists and trade union leaders. mr berlusconi is expected to table reforms aimed at boosting research and development (r&d) spending  and the competitiveness of small firms. also in focus will be bankruptcy laws and the slow pace of the legal system. the prime minister is scheduled to start the meeting at 1830 gmt.  the government has been accused of underfunding r&d  making it harder for italy to compete with other european nations and leading to a  brain-drain  of the country s brightest talents. analysts say that hiring and firing staff is still too difficult and expensive  hampering the development of small- and medium-sized businesses. as a result  they say  italy s corporate landscape is filled with numerous smaller companies that are often reluctant to become bigger because of all the extra hassle that would accompany the running of a larger firm. at the same time  bankruptcy laws make it difficult for failed company directors to set up new businesses and emerge from their debts  a situation that is hampering italy s entrepreneurial spirit.  the government says that it has set about tackling the problems  adding that getting growth going was the responsibility of all of italy s 60 million population. according to il sole 24 ore  italy s business newspaper  the government will focus on  opening up markets  infrastructure  research  making more incentives available  bankruptcy law  the slow pace of the justice system .  mr berlusconi has previously promised to cut taxes by 6.5bn euros ($8.6bn; £4.5bn) this year in an effort to get people and companies to spend. he has also promised to cap spending on transport  education and health so as to trim the ballooning budget deficit. italy plans to raise as much as 25bn euros from privatisations in 2005  including a partial flotation of the post office and utility enel. critics argue that these moves do not go far enough and could make italy s problems worse. limiting government spending will lead to job losses  they counter  while the income tax cuts will have a negligible effect on sentiment and ultimately favour the wealthy.  the country has been one of the eurozone s worst economic performers in recent years. growth was 1.1% in 2004  up from just 0.3% in 2003 and 0.4% in 2002 - an improvement but still a long way from ideal. at the same time  business and consumer confidence has dipped and analysts have raised concerns that what little spending there is stems from italians dipping into their savings accounts or using credit cards. without a pick up in national growth  they say  the money could eventually run out  bringing italy s economy to a juddering halt. consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of italy s economy.,itali get econom action plan italian prime minist silvio berlusconi unveil plan aim kickstart countri sputter economi thursday night rome present action plan develop itali meet industrialist trade union leader mr berlusconi expect tabl reform aim boost research develop rd spend competit small firm also focu bankruptci law slow pace legal system prime minist schedul start meet gmt govern accus underfund rd make harder itali compet european nation lead braindrain countri brightest talent analyst say hire fire staff still difficult expens hamper develop small medium busi result say itali corpor landscap fill numer small compani often reluct becom big extra hassl would accompani run large firm time bankruptci law make difficult fail compani director set new busi emerg debt situat hamper itali entrepreneuri spirit govern say set tackl problem ad get growth go respons itali million popul accord il sole ore itali busi newspap govern focu open market infrastructur research make incent avail bankruptci law slow pace justic system mr berlusconi previous promis cut tax bn euro bn £bn year effort get peopl compani spend also promis cap spend transport educ health trim balloon budget deficit itali plan rais much bn euro privatis includ partial flotat post offic util enel critic argu move go far enough could make itali problem wors limit govern spend lead job loss counter incom tax cut neglig effect sentiment ultim favour wealthi countri one eurozon bad econom perform recent year growth improv still long way ideal time busi consum confid dip analyst rais concern littl spend stem italian dip save account use credit card without pick nation growth say money could eventu run bring itali economi judder halt consum spend account twothird itali economi
38,320,business fears over sluggish eu economy as european leaders gather in rome on friday to sign the new eu constitution  many companies will be focusing on matters much closer to home - namely how to stay in business.  lille is a popular tourist destination for britons who want a taste of france at the weekend. but how many tourists look at the impressively grand victorian chambre de commerce  which stands beside the opera house  and consider that it was built - like the town halls in many northern english towns - on the wealth created by coal  steel and textiles  like northern england and industrial scotland  those industries have been in long term decline - the last coal pit closed in 1990. beck-crespel is a specialist steel firm in armentieres  about 20 miles from lille. the company has not laid off a worker since 1945. it specialises in making bolts and fixings for power stations and the oil industry  but not many of those are being built in europe these days.  director hugues charbonnier says he is under pressure because factories in the far east are able to make some of his output more cheaply  while his key markets are now in china and india.  in our business the market is absolutely global  you can not imagine living with our size (of business) even within an enlarged european union  (if we did that) we would need not 350 people but perhaps just 150 or 200   he says. it isn t just globalisation that is hurting; the law in france means workers are paid for a 39 hour week even though they work just 35 hours. but at least there is still a steel industry. coal has now totally vanished and textiles are struggling. new business has been attracted  but not enough to make up the difference.  that is one reason why people here are not great fans of the eu  says frederic sawicki  a politics lecturer at the university of lille.   in the region today the unemployment rate is 12%  in some areas it is 15%. they don t see what europe is doing for them  so there is a kind of euro scepticism  especially in the working classes   he says. which is strange because lille is at the crossroads of europe - if anywhere should be benefiting from the euro it is here. the euro was designed to increase trade within the eurozone  but the biggest increase in trade has been with the rest of the world. much of that trade passes through the world s largest port  rotterdam  in holland  home to specialist crane maker huisman itrec. its cranes help build oil rigs and lifted the sunken russian submarine kursk from the sea bed  but huisman itrec is now setting up a factory in china  where costs are cheaper and its main customers are closer.  boss henk addink blames the low growth rate in europe for the lack of orders closer to home.  in the us growth is something like 6%  in china they are estimating 15%  and in the eu it is more or less 1%   he says. mr addink blames the euro for stifling demand. he much preferred the old currencies of europe  which moved in relation to each country s economic performance. in germany  industry is exporting more these days  but the economy as a whole is once again mired in slow growth and high unemployment. growth is likely to peak this year at just under 2%. in britain that would be a bad year; in germany it is one of the best in recent years. with germany making up a third of the eurozone s economy  this is a major problem. if germany doesn t once again become the powerhouse of europe  growth across the bloc is never going to be as strong as it could be. however  at one factory near the dutch border things are changing.  the siemens plant at boscholt makes cordless phones and employs 2 000 staff. staff have started working an extra four hours a week for no extra pay  after siemens threatened to take the factory and their jobs to hungary. factory manager herbert stueker says that he now hopes to increase productivity  by nearly 30% . but germany needs much more reform if all its industry is to compete with places such hungary or china. the government is reforming the labour market and cutting the generous unemployment system  but the real solution is to cut the wages of low skilled workers  says helmut schneider  director of the institute for the study of labour at bonn university.  labour is too costly in germany  especially for the low skilled labour and this is the main problem. if we could solve that problem we could cut unemployment by half   he says. the eu set itself the target of being the most efficient economy in the world by 2010. four years into that process  and the target seems further away than ever.,busi fear sluggish eu economi european leader gather rome friday sign new eu constitut mani compani focus matter much closer home name stay busi lill popular tourist destin briton want tast franc weekend mani tourist look impress grand victorian chambr de commerc stand besid opera hous consid built like town hall mani northern english town wealth creat coal steel textil like northern england industri scotland industri long term declin last coal pit close beckcrespel specialist steel firm armentier mile lill compani laid worker sinc specialis make bolt fix power station oil industri mani built europ day director hugu charbonni say pressur factori far east abl make output cheapli key market china india busi market absolut global imagin live size busi even within enlarg european union would need peopl perhap say globalis hurt law franc mean worker paid hour week even though work hour least still steel industri coal total vanish textil struggl new busi attract enough make differ one reason peopl great fan eu say freder sawicki polit lectur univers lill region today unemploy rate area see europ kind euro sceptic especi work class say strang lill crossroad europ anywher benefit euro euro design increas trade within eurozon big increas trade rest world much trade pas world large port rotterdam holland home specialist crane maker huisman itrec crane help build oil rig lift sunken russian submarin kursk sea bed huisman itrec set factori china cost cheaper main custom closer bos henk addink blame low growth rate europ lack order closer home u growth someth like china estim eu less say mr addink blame euro stifl demand much prefer old currenc europ move relat countri econom perform germani industri export day economi whole mire slow growth high unemploy growth like peak year britain would bad year germani one best recent year germani make third eurozon economi major problem germani becom powerhous europ growth across bloc never go strong could howev one factori near dutch border thing chang siemen plant boscholt make cordless phone employ staff staff start work extra four hour week extra pay siemen threaten take factori job hungari factori manag herbert stueker say hope increas product nearli germani need much reform industri compet place hungari china govern reform labour market cut gener unemploy system real solut cut wage low skill worker say helmut schneider director institut studi labour bonn univers labour costli germani especi low skill labour main problem could solv problem could cut unemploy half say eu set target effici economi world four year process target seem away ever
39,1598,survey confirms property slowdown government figures have confirmed a widely reported slowdown of the uk s housing market in late 2004.  house prices were 11.8% higher on the year in the last quarter of 2004  down from 16.3% in the july-to-september quarter  the land registry said. the average house price in england and wales was £182 920  down from £187 971 in july-september. the volume of sales between october and december dropped by nearly a quarter from the same period in 2003. the government figures are the first official confirmation of falls in the market at the end of 2004. land registry figures are less up to date than those of banks and building societies  since they record completions not mortgage approvals. however  the figures are viewed as the most accurate measure of house prices as they include all property transactions  including cash sales.  the cost of buying a home fell in seven out of 10 regions between the third and fourth quarters of 2004.  the biggest annual gains were made in wales  where house prices were up by 23% in the fourth quarter. house prices rose the slowest in greater london  being up by 6%. in the capital  the volume of sales fell by 23% from 36 185 in 2003 to 28 041 for the same period in 2004. there was also a decline in the number of million-pound properties sold in the capital  with 436 properties over £1m sold compared to 469 for the same period in 2003. although the figures point to a slowdown in the market  the most recent surveys from nationwide and halifax have indicated the market may be undergoing a revival. after registering falls at the back end of 2004  halifax said house prices rose by 0.8% in january and nationwide reported a rise of 0.4% in the first month of the year. members of the bank of england s rate-setting committee will make their latest decision on interest rates on thursday.,survey confirm properti slowdown govern figur confirm wide report slowdown uk hous market late hous price high year last quarter julytoseptemb quarter land registri say averag hous price england wale £ £ julyseptemb volum sale octob decemb drop nearli quarter period govern figur first offici confirm fall market end land registri figur less date bank build societi sinc record complet mortgag approv howev figur view accur measur hous price includ properti transact includ cash sale cost buy home fell seven region third fourth quarter big annual gain make wale hous price fourth quarter hous price rise slowest great london capit volum sale fell period also declin number millionpound properti sell capit properti £m sell compar period although figur point slowdown market recent survey nationwid halifax indic market may undergo reviv regist fall back end halifax say hous price rise januari nationwid report rise first month year member bank england rateset committe make late decis interest rate thursday

41,1287,protesters plan airport challenge campaigners against the expansion of britain s airports have begun challenging the government s plans in the high court.  baa s expansion of stansted airport in essex by building an extra runway is one of the most fiercely opposed plans. opponents say the £2bn cost of the new runway could not be met unless cash from heathrow and gatwick was used. they said this is illegal under current rules and are trying to block the government from changing legislation. baa are also owners of the airports at heathrow and gatwick. they have said they cannot raise the money needed for the stansted upgrades from current landing charges. baa also says it has attempted to involve communities in any future airport plans.  groups challenging the plans include stop stansted expansion  heathrow anti-noise campaigners hacan clearskies and the london boroughs of hillingdon and wandsworth. their opponents are also likely to complain there was no public consultation before an extra runway was built at luton airport  or when it changed take-off and landing procedures at heathrow. if the group wins  the government s future aviation plans outlined in last year s transport white paper could be left in ruins.  the campaigners will say the government did not adequately consider the building of new airports  such as one planned for the isle of sheppey east of london. lord hanningfield  leader of essex county council  told bbc radio 4 s today programme:  we are going to the high court because we want a judge to rule there should be a proper inquiry.  we want a judge to say there has been inadequate preparation  consultation and thought before the government came out with its green paper.  then there could be a proper debate nationally about where this extra capacity should go.  he added:  politicians should not decide where runways should be.  the stansted expansion  apart from the building of the new runway  would also need to include new terminal buildings to deal with the projected 50m passengers who will use it every year.  the airport is the hub of many of the no-frills airlines operating in the uk. but baa has said it has attempted to involve communities in any future airport plans. at heathrow  gatwick  edinburgh and glasgow airports  baa launched a series of consultations on blight to properties from the proposed expansion in september 2004  which will close next week. baa is also offering to buy noise-hit properties for an index-linked  unblighted price. at heathrow  baa said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental  air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met. at gatwick  the company has written to homes and business likely to be affected by any extra runway.,protest plan airport challeng campaign expans britain airport begin challeng govern plan high court baa expans stanst airport essex build extra runway one fierc oppos plan oppon say £bn cost new runway could met unless cash heathrow gatwick use say illeg current rule tri block govern chang legisl baa also owner airport heathrow gatwick say rais money need stanst upgrad current land charg baa also say attempt involv commun futur airport plan group challeng plan includ stop stanst expans heathrow antinois campaign hacan clearski london borough hillingdon wandsworth oppon also like complain public consult extra runway built luton airport chang takeoff land procedur heathrow group win govern futur aviat plan outlin last year transport white paper could left ruin campaign say govern adequ consid build new airport one plan isl sheppey east london lord hanningfield leader essex counti council told bbc radio today programm go high court want judg rule proper inquiri want judg say inadequ prepar consult thought govern come green paper could proper debat nation extra capac go ad politician decid runway stanst expans apart build new runway would also need includ new termin build deal project m passeng use everi year airport hub mani nofril airlin oper uk baa say attempt involv commun futur airport plan heathrow gatwick edinburgh glasgow airport baa launch seri consult blight properti propos expans septemb close next week baa also offer buy noisehit properti indexlink unblight price heathrow baa say work close interest parti see strict environment air qualiti nois target third runway met gatwick compani write home busi like affect extra runway
42,832,muslims discuss election concerns issues that muslims should be considering before voting in the next general election are to be debated by uk community representatives.  the event is being held by the muslim association of britain (mab)  which believes muslim voters could influence the result in up to 50 constituencies. last year mab  which opposed the war in iraq  urged muslims not to vote for labour in the european elections. but a spokesman stressed the meeting was  not necessarily anti-labour .  this meeting is not anti-party in particular  it s anti-policy  it s on the issues we are going to ask muslims to vote on   mab spokesman dr azzam tamimi said of tuesday s event.   there are issues of concern to muslims  and muslims generally agree on them but have not in the past been aware of how a vote can serve these issues.  dr tamimi said the main issues muslims should consider were what he referred to as the war on iraq  the palestinian situation  the erosion of civil liberties for muslims in the uk and economic  social and education problems.  approximately 1.1m of the uk s 1.6m muslims are of voting age. previous election research has shown the overwhelming majority have traditionally voted labour  but more recent studies have suggested labour support has been falling away significantly among some muslim voters.  anger over the war in iraq has appeared to be the main reason  with many saying it was  unjustified . representatives from a number of muslim organisations will attend tuesday s event. among them will be the muslim council of britain (mcb). the chairman of the mcb s public affairs committee  sher khan  said the war in iraq would be a  significant factor  affecting muslims  voting intentions.  i think it s going to be quite significant because of the number of seats in which they could have an impact   mr khan said.  however  professor john curtice  of the university of strathclyde  is sceptical about how much difference tactical voting by muslims could make.  for the most part the labour constituencies where there s a large muslim community are relatively safe  but there are one or two that are not quite so safe   professor curtice said.  the constituencies where labour was most at risk from a muslim tactical vote were bethnal green  in east london  and rochdale in lancashire  he added. in bethnal green  former labour mp george galloway  who founded the anti-war party respect  is standing against sitting mp oona king  who had a 10 000-vote majority in 2001. in rochdale  the liberal democrats - the mainstream party a 2004 icm survey showed was benefiting most from muslim disaffection with labour - secured second place in the 2001 election  securing just under 6 000 votes fewer than labour s lorna fitzsimons. but professor curtice said the muslim anti-war vote could be split between the liberal democrats and respect  meaning neither would benefit much at the ballot box.  ironically the tories might be the beneficiaries if labour does lose seats  which is generally the case   he said. but dr tamimi said mab s intention was not to  empower  the tories.  we know the next government will be labour  but we are aiming to send a message that it will make a difference if the muslims use their vote properly.  if the next labour government has a reduced majority that s a great achievement because having a very big majority has been very harmful for politics in this country   dr tamimi said.,muslim discus elect concern issu muslim consid vote next gener elect debat uk commun repres event held muslim associ britain mab believ muslim voter could influenc result constitu last year mab oppos war iraq urg muslim vote labour european elect spokesman stress meet necessarili antilabour meet antiparti particular antipolici issu go ask muslim vote mab spokesman dr azzam tamimi say tuesday event issu concern muslim muslim gener agre past awar vote serv issu dr tamimi say main issu muslim consid refer war iraq palestinian situat eros civil liberti muslim uk econom social educ problem approxim m uk m muslim vote age previou elect research show overwhelm major tradit vote labour recent studi suggest labour support fall away significantli among muslim voter anger war iraq appear main reason mani say unjustifi repres number muslim organis attend tuesday event among muslim council britain mcb chairman mcb public affair committe sher khan say war iraq would signific factor affect muslim vote intent think go quit signific number seat could impact mr khan say howev professor john curtic univers strathclyd sceptic much differ tactic vote muslim could make part labour constitu larg muslim commun rel safe one two quit safe professor curtic say constitu labour risk muslim tactic vote bethnal green east london rochdal lancashir ad bethnal green former labour mp georg galloway found antiwar parti respect stand sit mp oona king vote major rochdal liber democrat mainstream parti icm survey show benefit muslim disaffect labour secur second place elect secur vote few labour lorna fitzsimon professor curtic say muslim antiwar vote could split liber democrat respect mean neither would benefit much ballot box iron torus might beneficiari labour lose seat gener case say dr tamimi say mab intent empow torus know next govern labour aim send messag make differ muslim use vote properli next labour govern reduc major great achiev big major harm polit countri dr tamimi say

47,1517,falconer rebuts  charade  claims concessions on a bill which critics claim would allow euthanasia  through the back door  were not a political ploy  the lord chancellor has said.  ministers have been accused of panic in offering last minute changes to the mental capacity bill amid chaotic scenes in the commons on tuesday. lord falconer said it was fair to criticise the late timing of the offer. he said the changes provided a solution to a very difficult issue but some mps argue the situation is still unclear.  the bill allows people to give somebody the power of attorney to make decisions on their behalf if they become too ill to decide for themselves. ministers insist the plans would not change laws on euthanasia and would improve safeguards. critics fear it could allow  killing by omission  through withdrawing treatment  including food and fluids.  tony blair said he would do everything he could to meet concerns about the bill. but changes to the bill must not overturn the law set when a court ruled that doctors could withdraw artificial feeding and hydration from hillsborough coma victim tony bland.  it is important we don t end up in the situation where doctors and consultants are confused about the law and may lay themselves open to prosecution in circumstances where no sensible person would want that to happen   he said.  on tuesday  the government saw off a backbench attempt to force changes to the bill by 297 votes to 203  despite rebellion by 34 labour mps. the revolt was also reduced by news that lord falconer had promised the catholic archbishop of cardiff to strengthen safeguards in the bill. but that only came after mps bombarded constitutional affairs minister david lammy with a barrage of requests for him to read the letter as they complained they had been left in the dark. eventually  he was hurriedly handed the letter to read out five minutes before the crunch votes  prompting claims of a shambles. the deputy speaker later said the debate had not been handled as it should have been.  lord falconer says there will be amendments when the bill goes to the house of lords. he told bbc news:  we have given a commitment to put into the bill a clause that says that nothing in the bill authorises any act where the motive of the person authorising the decision is to end life.  the motive has got to be to end suffering.  he denied the concessions were a  political manoeuvre  forced by panic about the rebellion. it was inevitable that minds became more focused as the bill went through parliament but the result was a  sensible solution   he said.  i don t think it is something to be embarrassed about. these issues are not easy to deal with   he went on. bbc political editor andrew marr said mr lammy was  waste deep in quicksand and sinking fast  after his performance. but lord falconer praised his minister for an  excellent job . former conservative leader iain duncan smith  one of the chief critics of the plans  condemned the debate as a  charade  and complained the promises of changes to the bill were vague.,falcon rebut charad claim concess bill critic claim would allow euthanasia back door polit ploy lord chancellor say minist accus panic offer last minut chang mental capac bill amid chaotic scene common tuesday lord falcon say fair criticis late time offer say chang provid solut difficult issu mp argu situat still unclear bill allow peopl give somebodi power attorney make decis behalf becom ill decid minist insist plan would chang law euthanasia would improv safeguard critic fear could allow kill omiss withdraw treatment includ food fluid toni blair say would everyth could meet concern bill chang bill must overturn law set court rule doctor could withdraw artifici feed hydrat hillsborough coma victim toni bland import end situat doctor consult confus law may lay open prosecut circumst sensibl person would want happen say tuesday govern saw backbench attempt forc chang bill vote despit rebellion labour mp revolt also reduc news lord falcon promis cathol archbishop cardiff strengthen safeguard bill come mp bombard constitut affair minist david lammi barrag request read letter complain left dark eventu hurriedli hand letter read five minut crunch vote prompt claim shambl deputi speaker later say debat handl lord falcon say amend bill goe hous lord told bbc news give commit put bill claus say noth bill authoris act motiv person authoris decis end life motiv get end suffer deni concess polit manoeuvr forc panic rebellion inevit mind becam focus bill go parliament result sensibl solut say think someth embarrass issu easi deal go bbc polit editor andrew marr say mr lammi wast deep quicksand sink fast perform lord falcon prais minist excel job former conserv leader iain duncan smith one chief critic plan condemn debat charad complain promis chang bill vagu
48,1920,iraqis win death test case probe the family of an iraqi civilian allegedly killed by uk troops have won a challenge against the government s refusal to order a full inquiry.  the high court ruled on tuesday that baha mousa s death in british custody in iraq fell within the european convention on human rights. and the judges paved the way for an independent inquiry by saying previous investigations were inadequate. but judicial reviews into five other deaths in southern iraq were ruled out. their families will be appealing against the judgement.  the families  solicitor phil shiner described it as  a historic day for human rights and the rule of law in the uk . father-of-two mr mousa  28  a hotel receptionist  was arrested with eight men seized at a hotel in basra in september 2003. he was allegedly beaten to death while in the custody of the queen s lancashire regiment. the iraqi families  lawyer argued that failing to adequately investigate the death breached the european convention on human rights.  ministry of defence lawyers argued the uk-controlled area of southern iraq was outside european jurisdiction. but lord justice rix and mr justice forbes ruled that uk jurisdiction could extend to a uk-run prison  but did not apply  to the total territory of another state . they said as mr mousa was in custody when he died  his case came within the uk s jurisdiction. the other five iraqis did not die in custody  so their cases had to fail  they said.  and it was difficult to say that the investigation which had already occurred  has been timely  open or effective   the judges said. after the ruling carla ferstman  legal director of the human rights organisation redress  said:  it is not enough for the military to investigate behind closed doors.  there must be an effective public investigation by an independent official body. only such an investigation could reveal what really happened and who might be responsible.  other allegations involving british soldiers included the shooting of an iraqi police commissioner and the shooting of four iraqi civilians in may 2003. both sides were granted permission to appeal.  prime minister tony blair s official spokesman said:  obviously we will need to study this detailed judgment. i would point out  however  that a separate criminal case is currently being considered by the army prosecuting authority.  i can t say anything further for obvious reasons. the mod are considering whether to appeal.  but former british commander colonel bob stewart said :  anyone at the top [of the military] will be saddened by the verdict that has taken place but will say:  if there s a case to answer  let s have it out. because we don t want people thinking that british soldiers beat up civilians and get away with it    he said.  the ministry of defence does everything in its power to try to prove we act ethically and properly under the rules of war.,iraqi win death test case probe famili iraqi civilian allegedli kill uk troop challeng govern refus order full inquiri high court rule tuesday baha mousa death british custodi iraq fell within european convent human right judg pave way independ inquiri say previou investig inadequ judici review five death southern iraq rule famili appeal judgement famili solicitor phil shiner describ histor day human right rule law uk fatheroftwo mr mousa hotel receptionist arrest eight men seiz hotel basra septemb allegedli beaten death custodi queen lancashir regiment iraqi famili lawyer argu fail adequ investig death breach european convent human right ministri defenc lawyer argu ukcontrol area southern iraq outsid european jurisdict lord justic rix mr justic forb rule uk jurisdict could extend ukrun prison appli total territori anoth state say mr mousa custodi die case come within uk jurisdict five iraqi die custodi case fail say difficult say investig alreadi occur time open effect judg say rule carla ferstman legal director human right organis redress say enough militari investig behind close door must effect public investig independ offici bodi investig could reveal realli happen might respons alleg involv british soldier includ shoot iraqi polic commission shoot four iraqi civilian may side grant permiss appeal prime minist toni blair offici spokesman say obvious need studi detail judgment would point howev separ crimin case current consid armi prosecut author say anyth obviou reason mod consid whether appeal former british command colonel bob stewart say anyon top militari sadden verdict take place say case answer let want peopl think british soldier beat civilian get away say ministri defenc everyth power tri prove act ethic properli rule war
49,1764,mourinho to escape fa charge chelsea boss jose mourinho will not face any football association action over the comments he made after their carling cup tie with manchester united.  mourinho intimated that united boss sir alex ferguson influenced referee neale barry after the duo walked down the tunnel together at half-time. but an fa spokesman told bbc sport:  we are not taking action over mourinho.  we have looked at the comments and we have decided that no further action is required. that is the end of it.  mourinho was concerned that ferguson s conversation with barry was followed by an inconsistent display by the official.  i see one referee in the first half and another in the second   said mourinho.  if the fa ask me what happened  i will tell them. what i saw and felt made it easier to understand a few things.   maybe when i turn 60 and have been managing in the same league for 20 years and have the respect of everybody i will have the power to speak to people and make them tremble a little bit.  the referee controlled the game in one way during the first half but in the second they had dozens of free-kicks. it was fault after fault  dive after dive.  but i know the referee did not walk to the dressing rooms alone at half-time. he should only have had his two assistants and the fourth official with him  but there was also someone else.  referees chief keith hackett believes mourinho should retract his comments about ferguson and barry as he believes the blues boss has questioned their integrity.  i m hoping he might reconsider his comments  unfortunately this is the nature of the game   said hackett.  i don t want referees or myself getting in the psychological warfare between two managers. for the second leg we have an experienced referee  and we should be talking about the quality of that game rather than the refereeing.  sometimes managers have grounds for comments  and i note that  but a referees integrity has been questioned  that is offensive and should be avoided. mr mourinho should look at the facts.  mourinho added that the match was entertaining for a goalless draw and insisted his team could still reach the final.  it s 0-0  so if we win we go through and if we get a draw we go to extra time   he said.  we have exactly the same chance we had before this game.  we are confident of getting a result but we know what manchester united is  a footballing power. it ll be difficult for us  but also for them.,mourinho escap fa charg chelsea bos jose mourinho face footbal associ action comment make carl cup tie manchest unit mourinho intim unit bos sir alex ferguson influenc refere neal barri duo walk tunnel togeth halftim fa spokesman told bbc sport take action mourinho look comment decid action requir end mourinho concern ferguson convers barri follow inconsist display offici see one refere first half anoth second say mourinho fa ask happen tell saw felt make easy understand thing mayb turn manag leagu year respect everybodi power speak peopl make trembl littl bit refere control game one way first half second dozen freekick fault fault dive dive know refere walk dress room alon halftim two assist fourth offici also someon el refere chief keith hackett believ mourinho retract comment ferguson barri believ blue bos question integr hope might reconsid comment unfortun natur game say hackett want refere get psycholog warfar two manag second leg experienc refere talk qualiti game rather refere sometim manag ground comment note refere integr question offens avoid mr mourinho look fact mourinho ad match entertain goalless draw insist team could still reach final win go get draw go extra time say exactli chanc game confid get result know manchest unit footbal power difficult u also

51,1466,parties  plans for council tax anger at council tax rises spilled over into mass protests in 2003  when the average english bill rose 12.9%.  pensioners  protests spread - some marched  others simply refused to pay the increase. some  such as 83-year-old elizabeth winkfield  said they would rather go to jail. the audit commission found the whole local government finance system was  fundamentally flawed  and all three of the main parties have said the system has to change.  labour says it wants to retain the property-based tax but reform it to make it fairer and says there is scope for councils to become more efficient. they say they are already helping pensioners with council tax bills  with a £100 lump sum for the over-70s and last year the government capped some local councils  budgets to keep demands down. deputy prime minister john prescott has said the current system is not sustainable in the long term and said there would be  radical reform . the party says this year s increases will be the lowest in a decade. a report last year looked at increasing the number of council tax bands and other forms of local taxation  such as reformed business rates  although no decisions have been made. an independent inquiry into its findings  the lyons review  is due to report back at the end of 2005.  the tories have promised a reduction on bills for pensioners  who they say have been hardest hit by year-on-year increases in council tax. they say they can save £4bn on  government waste   of which £1.3bn could be used to cut pensioners  bills by an average of £340. it would not be means tested  say the tories  because that would create more bureaucracy and could discourage people from saving for their retirement. instead households where council tax payers are over 65 would get a rebate covering half their bill  up to a maximum of £500. the tories also say they are suspicious about any proposals to revalue homes - currently graded according to their value in 1991 - because they believe seven million of homes could move up a band.  the liberal democrats want to do away with the council tax altogether and switch to a local income tax of the kind seen in the usa  norway and switzerland. the rate would be set locally  but administered by the inland revenue which they say would save at least £300m. they say the council tax is the most unpopular and most unfair tax in britain  because it puts a  ceiling  on what the richest pay. the party says it would aim for a £5 000 tax-free personal allowance  or a £7 000 allowance for the over-65s. after that income would be taxed up to £100 000. the lib dems say their plan is fairer  more efficient  has already been tested abroad and offers more accountability.,parti plan council tax anger council tax rise spill mass protest averag english bill rise pension protest spread march other simpli refus pay increas yearold elizabeth winkfield say would rather go jail audit commiss found whole local govern financ system fundament flaw three main parti say system chang labour say want retain propertybas tax reform make fairer say scope council becom effici say alreadi help pension council tax bill £ lump sum over last year govern cap local council budget keep demand deputi prime minist john prescott say current system sustain long term say would radic reform parti say year increas low decad report last year look increas number council tax band form local taxat reform busi rate although decis make independ inquiri find lyon review due report back end torus promis reduct bill pension say hardest hit yearonyear increas council tax say save £bn govern wast £bn could use cut pension bill averag £ would mean test say torus would creat bureaucraci could discourag peopl save retir instead household council tax payer would get rebat cover half bill maximum £ torus also say suspici propos revalu home current grade accord valu believ seven million home could move band liber democrat want away council tax altogeth switch local incom tax kind see usa norway switzerland rate would set local administ inland revenu say would save least £m say council tax unpopular unfair tax britain put ceil richest pay parti say would aim £ taxfre person allow £ allow over incom would tax £ lib dem say plan fairer effici alreadi test abroad offer account
52,1194,gadget market  to grow in 2005  the explosion in consumer technology is to continue into 2005  delegates at the world s largest gadget show  in las vegas  have been told.  the number of gadgets in the shops is predicted to grow by 11%  while devices which talk to each other will become increasingly important.  everything is going digital   kirsten pfeifer from the consumer electronics association  told the bbc news website. the consumer electronics show (ces) featured the pick of 2005 s products.  consumers are controlling what they want and technologies like hdtvs [high-definition tvs]  digital radio  and digital cameras will remain strong in 2005.  all the products on show really showed the breadth and depth of the industry.  despite showing diversity  some delegates attending complained that the showcase lacked as much  wow factor  as in previous years.  the portable technologies on show also reflected one of the buzzwords of ces  which was the  time and place shifting  of multimedia content - being able to watch and listen to video and music anywhere  at any time. at the start of last year s ces  the cea predicted there would be an average growth of 4% in 2004. that figure was surpassed with the rise in popularity of portable digital music players  personal video recorders and digital cameras. it was clear also that gadgets are becoming a lot more about lifestyle choice  with fashion and personalisation becoming increasingly key to the way gadgets are designed. part of this has been the rise in spending power of the  generation x-ers  who have grown up with technology and who now have the spending power and desire for more devices that suit them. more than 57% of the consumer electronics market is made up of female buyers  according to cea research. hybrid devices  which combine a number of multimedia functions  were also in evidence on the show floor.  a lot of this is driven by just the ability to do it   said stephen baker  a consumer electronics analyst with retail research firm npd group.  some of these functions cost next to nothing to add.   as well as the show floor showcasing everything from tiny wearable mp3 players to giant high-definition tvs  several keynote speeches were made by industry leaders  such as microsoft chief bill gates. despite several embarrassing technical glitches during mr gate s pre-show speech  he announced several new partnerships - mainly for the us market. he unveiled new ways of letting people take tv shows recorded on personal video recorders and watch them back on portable devices. he disappointed some  however  by failing to announce any details of the next generation of the xbox games console. another disappointment was the lack of exposure sony s new portable games device  the psp  had at the show. sony said the much-anticipated gadget would most likely start shipping in march for the us and europe. it went on sale in japan before christmas. there were only two psps embedded in glass cabinets at the show though and no representatives to discuss further details. a sony representative told the bbc news website this was because sony did not consider it to be part of their  consumer technology  offering.  elsewhere at the show  there was a plethora of colour and plasma screens  including samsung s 102-inch (2.6 metre) plasma - the largest in the world. industry experts were also excited about high-definition technologies coming to the fore in 2005  with new formats for dvds coming out which will hold six times as much data as conventional dvds. with so many devices on the move there were a lot of products on show offering external storage  like seagate s 5gb pocket sized external hard drive  which won an innovation for engineering and design prize. more than 120 000 trade professionals attended ces in las vegas  which officially ran from 6 to 9 january.,gadget market grow explos consum technolog continu deleg world large gadget show la vega told number gadget shop predict grow devic talk becom increasingli import everyth go digit kirsten pfeifer consum electron associ told bbc news websit consum electron show ce featur pick product consum control want technolog like hdtv highdefinit tv digit radio digit camera remain strong product show realli show breadth depth industri despit show diver deleg attend complain showcas lack much wow factor previou year portabl technolog show also reflect one buzzword ce time place shift multimedia content abl watch listen video music anywher time start last year ce cea predict would averag growth figur surpass rise popular portabl digit music player person video record digit camera clear also gadget becom lot lifestyl choic fashion personalis becom increasingli key way gadget design part rise spend power gener xer grown technolog spend power desir devic suit consum electron market make femal buyer accord cea research hybrid devic combin number multimedia function also evid show floor lot driven abil say stephen baker consum electron analyst retail research firm npd group function cost next noth add well show floor showcas everyth tini wearabl mp player giant highdefinit tv sever keynot speech make industri leader microsoft chief bill gate despit sever embarrass technic glitch mr gate preshow speech announc sever new partnership mainli u market unveil new way let peopl take tv show record person video record watch back portabl devic disappoint howev fail announc detail next gener xbox game consol anoth disappoint lack exposur soni new portabl game devic psp show soni say muchanticip gadget would like start ship march u europ go sale japan christma two psp embed glass cabinet show though repres discus detail soni repres told bbc news websit soni consid part consum technolog offer elsewher show plethora colour plasma screen includ samsung inch metr plasma large world industri expert also excit highdefinit technolog come fore new format dvd come hold six time much data convent dvd mani devic move lot product show offer extern storag like seagat gb pocket size extern hard drive innov engin design prize trade profession attend ce la vega offici ran januari

54,645,rings of steel combat net attacks gambling is hugely popular  especially with tech-savvy criminals.  many extortionists are targeting net-based betting firms and threatening to cripple their websites with deluges of data unless a ransom is paid. but now deep defences are being put in place by some of the uk s biggest net firms to stop these attacks. increasing numbers of attacks and the huge amounts of data being used to try to bump a site off the web are prompting firms to adopt the measures.  net firms are realising that it s not just about anti-virus and firewalls   said paul king  chief security architect at cisco.  there are more things that can be done in the network to protect data centres.  mr king said the only way to properly combat these so-called distributed denial-of-service attacks was with intelligent net-based systems. many of the gambling sites suffering ddos attacks are in offshore data and hosting centres  so any large scale data flood could knock out access to many more sites than just the one the criminals were targeting  said mr king. this overspill effect was only likely to grow as attacks grow in size and scale.  malcolm seagrave  security expert at energis  said the most common types of attacks hit sites with 10 megabytes of data over short periods of time. bigger attacks sending down 200 megabytes of traffic or more were rarely seen  he said.  it does feel like they are turning the dial because you see this traffic gradually growing   he said.  so far there have been no attacks involving gigabytes of data  said mr seagrave. however  he added that it was only a matter of time before such large attacks were mounted. maria capella  spokeswoman for net provider pipex  said that when ddos attacks were at their height  customers were getting hit every four to five days. the defences being put in place constantly monitor the streams of data flowing across networks and pluck out the traffic destined for target sites.  it s about understanding what s genuine traffic and keeping attack traffic from going to the site   she said.  we study the profile of their traffic and as soon as we see an anomaly in the profile that s when we start to get the backbone engineering boys to see if we are going to sustain an attack   said ms capella. this traffic can be hard to spot because ddos attacks typically use thousands of computers in many different countries  each participating machine only sends a small part of the entire data flood.  typically these computers have been infected by a virus or worm which reports its success and the net address of compromised machines back to the malicious hacker or hi-tech criminal that set off the virus. hijacked computers are known as zombies or  bots and collections of them are called  bot nets. many spammers rent out  bot nets to help them anonymously send junk mail.  most of the zombies are based outside the country that hosts the target site so getting the attacking pcs shut off can be difficult. often pipex and other net suppliers do get advance notice that an attack is about to happen.  the serious players tend to precede an attack with some kind of ransom e-mail   said ms capella.  we ask  as part of the service we provide  that customers notify us of anything they have in advance that would give us forewarning.  once an attack is spotted dedicated net hardware takes over to remove the attack traffic and ensure that sites stay up. energis took a similar approach  said mr seagrave.  we have technology out there that allows us to detect attacks in minutes rather than let network engineers spend hours pulling the information together   said mr seagrave. also net firms were starting to work more closely together on the problem of ddos attacks and pool information about where they are coming from. information gathered on attacks and where they originated has led to some arrests. he said energis also did its own intelligence work to get in insight into which sites criminal gangs plan to target.  we have people in places where they shouldn t be  monitoring tech sites   he said. sometimes though  he said  spotting the next victim was easy.  you can see them going alphabetically through the list with the gambling sites  trying one after another   said mr seagrave.,ring steel combat net attack gambl huge popular especi techsavvi

56,1999,cannabis hopes for drug firm a prescription cannabis drug made by uk biotech firm gw pharmaceuticals is set to be approved in canada.  the drug is used to treat the central nervous system and alleviate the symptoms of multiple sclerosis (ms). a few weeks ago  shares in gw pharma lost a third of their value after uk regulators said they wanted more evidence about the drug s benefits. but now canadian authorities have said the sativex drug will be considered for approval.  approximately 50 000 people in canada have been diagnosed with ms and 85 000 people are suffering from the condition in the uk. many patients already smoke cannabis to relieve their symptoms.  now  gw pharma s sativex mouth spray could be legally available to ms sufferers in canada within the next few months. this will be the first time a cannabis-based drug has been approved anywhere in the world  representing a landmark for gw pharma and for patients with ms. final approval in canada should now be little more than a formality  analysts said  and the company expects full approval for sativex early in 2005.  we are delighted to receive this qualifying notice from health canada and look forward to receiving regulatory approval for sativex in canada in the early part of 2005   said gw pharma executive chairman dr geoffrey guy.  the uk government granted gw pharma a licence to grow the cannabis plant for medical research purposes. satifex consists of a cannabis extract containing tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol  a cocktail that has also proved effective in treating patients with arthritis. thousands of plants are grown at a secret location somewhere in the english countryside. despite hopes of regulatory approval last year  a series of delays has put back sativex s launch in the uk. the latest news sent shares in gw pharma up 8.5p  or 8.1%  to 113.5p.,cannabi hope drug firm prescript cannabi drug make uk biotech firm gw pharmaceut set approv canada drug use treat central nervou system allevi symptom multipl sclerosi m week ago share gw pharma lose third valu uk regul say want evid drug benefit canadian author say sativex drug consid approv approxim peopl canada diagnos m peopl suffer condit uk mani patient alreadi smoke cannabi reliev symptom gw pharma sativex mouth spray could legal avail m suffer canada within next month first time cannabisbas drug approv anywher world repres landmark gw pharma patient m final approv canada littl formal analyst say compani expect full approv sativex earli delight receiv qualifi notic health canada look forward receiv regulatori approv sativex canada earli part say gw pharma execut chairman dr geoffrey guy uk govern grant gw pharma licenc grow cannabi plant medic research purpos satifex consist cannabi extract contain tetrahydrocannabinol cannabidiol cocktail also prove effect treat patient arthriti thousand plant grown secret locat somewher english countrysid despit hope regulatori approv last year seri delay put back sativex launch uk late news sent share gw pharma p p
57,1557,reboot ordered for eu patent law a european parliament committee has ordered a rewrite of the proposals for controversial new european union rules which govern computer-based inventions.  the legal affairs committee (juri) said the commission should re-submit the computer implemented inventions directive after meps failed to back it. it has had vocal critics who say it could favour large over small firms and impact open-source software innovation. supporters say it would let firms protect their inventions. the directive is intended to offer patent protection to inventions that use software to achieve their effect  in other words   computer implemented invention . the draft law suffered setbacks when poland  one of the largest eu member states  rejected its adoption twice in two months. intense lobbying on the issue has started to gain momentum in some national parliaments putting them under immense pressure. only two meps backed the draft law at the juri meeting  with one voting to abstain.  opponents of the draft directive welcomed the decision and said a new first reading of the proposals would give the eu a chance to have fuller debates about its implications in all member states. in the us  the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted. this means that the us-based amazon.com holds a patent for its  one-click shopping  service  for example. critics are concerned that the directive could lead to a similar model happening in europe. this  they fear  could hurt small software developers because they do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies if they had to fight patent legal action in court. supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up a playing field without bringing eu laws in line with the us.,reboot order eu patent law european parliament committe order rewrit propos controversi new european union rule govern computerbas invent legal affair committe juri say commiss resubmit comput implement invent direct mep fail back vocal critic say could favour larg small firm impact opensourc softwar innov support say would let firm protect invent direct intend offer patent protect invent use softwar achiev effect word comput implement invent draft law suffer setback poland one large eu member state reject adopt twice two month intens lobbi issu start gain momentum nation parliament put immens pressur two mep back draft law juri meet one vote abstain oppon draft direct welcom decis say new first read propos would give eu chanc fuller debat implic member state u patent comput program internet busi method permit mean usbas amazoncom hold patent oneclick shop servic exampl critic concern direct could lead similar model happen europ fear could hurt small softwar develop legal financi might large compani fight patent legal action court support say current law ineffici would serv even play field without bring eu law line u
58,1072,tories plan migrant health checks non-european union citizens wanting to work in the uk will have to undergo tests for tuberculosis and hiv  under plans unveiled by the conservatives.  a positive test for tb would mean visa applications being turned down  while hiv would be dealt with case by case. leader michael howard said the checks on new arrivals would help protect public health and the nhs. labour said many tests were already done. the lib dems warned both parties against  pandering to prejudice .  the proposals  which would be brought in if the conservatives won the general election  would not apply to people coming to the uk for less than six months unless they intended to work in health or childcare or teaching. mr howard said the plans were based on policies already in action in canada  new zealand and australia.  it s very important that we should safeguard the good standards of public health that britain enjoys   he told bbc radio 4 s today programme. government figures suggest tb in england has increased by 25% over the past 10 years.  nearly two thirds of people with tb are born abroad   said mr howard.   i don t think a responsible government can stand aside and do nothing in the face of this problem.  but mr howard said the plans would not affect asylum applicants  claims. the proposals include:  - people coming to the uk from outside the eu for between six and 12 months from a  high incidence tb country  will have to undergo a chest x-ray.   - people coming to settle in the uk permanently from outside the eu will have to  demonstrate they have an acceptable standard of health .   - they will also have to show they are unlikely to be a danger to public health and are unlikely to  impose significant costs or demands  on the nhs.   - the tests will include a health check  chest x-rays for tb (except for children and pregnant women) and tests for hepatitis and hiv for over 16-year-olds. only the discovery of tb will mean people will be automatically denied a visa  other conditions will be dealt with on a  case by case basis .  there is already some screening in place. last year 185 000 people were tested for tb at heathrow and gatwick airports  only about 200 were found to be infected. and dr john moore-gillon  of the british lung foundation  said:  tb is not simply imported  we are seeing a rise in many sections of the uk-born population as well.  the government says the tories are  a bit late  to the issue. immigration minister des browne quoted its five-year plan for immigration and asylum  as saying:  we are implementing our existing powers by targeted health screening for tb in high-risk areas at the entry clearance stage.  those who are diagnosed would then need to seek treatment at home before being allowed to enter the uk.  meanwhile mark oaten  liberal democrat home affairs spokesman  said:  this is another worrying step in the war of words over asylum and immigration between labour and the conservatives.  michael howard knows perfectly well what bigger game he is playing  and history proves it is a very dangerous one.  lisa power  head of policy at aids charity the terrence higgins trust said the policy was prejudice-based rather than evidence-based.  in fact  it would be more likely to drive people with health conditions to falsify tests while others gain entry by simple dint of their eu status   she said.,torus plan migrant health check noneuropean union citizen want work uk undergo test tuberculosi hiv plan unveil conserv posit test tb would mean visa applic turn hiv would dealt case case leader michael howard say check new arriv would help protect public health nh labour say mani test alreadi do lib dem warn parti pander prejudic propos would brought conserv gener elect would appli peopl come uk less six month unless intend work health childcar teach mr howard say plan base polici alreadi action canada new zealand australia import safeguard good standard public health britain enjoy told bbc radio today programm govern figur suggest tb england increas past year nearli two third peopl tb born abroad say mr howard think respons govern stand asid noth face problem mr howard say plan would affect asylum applic claim propos includ peopl come uk outsid eu six month high incid tb countri undergo chest xray peopl come settl uk perman outsid eu demonstr accept standard health also show unlik danger public health unlik impos signific cost demand nh test includ health check chest xray tb except child pregnant woman test hepat hiv yearold discoveri tb mean peopl automat deni visa condit dealt case case basi alreadi screen place last year peopl test tb heathrow gatwick airport found infect dr john mooregillon british lung foundat say tb simpli import see rise mani section ukborn popul well govern say torus bit late issu immigr minist de brown quot fiveyear plan immigr asylum say implement exist power target health screen tb highrisk area entri clearanc stage diagnos would need seek treatment home allow enter uk meanwhil mark oaten liber democrat home affair spokesman say anoth worri step war word asylum immigr labour conserv michael howard know perfectli well big game play histori prove danger one lisa power head polici aid chariti terrenc higgin trust say polici prejudicebas rather evidencebas fact would like drive peopl health condit falsifi test other gain entri simpl dint eu statu say
59,70,indonesia  declines debt freeze  indonesia no longer needs the debt freeze offered by the paris club group of creditors  economics minister aburizal bakrie has reportedly said.  indonesia  which originally accepted the debt moratorium offer  owes the paris club about $48bn (£25.5bn). mr bakrie told the bisnis indonesia newspaper that a $1.7bn donors  aid package meant that the debt moratorium was unnecessary. this aid comes on top of a previously-pledged $3.4bn package. most of this  normal aid  would be used to finance the country s budget deficit. the indonesian economics minister explained that the money - $1.2bn in grants and $500m in soft loans - was for the rebuilding of aceh province  which was badly hit by the tsunami of 26 december. nevertheless  one of mr bakrie s deputies  mahendra siregar  told afp news agency that indonesia was still considering the offer by the paris club of rich creditor nations to temporarily suspend its debt payments.  what is true is that we are still discussing... the paris club decision to find out more details such as how much of our debt will be subject to a moratorium. that s how far we are at this stage   said mr siregar.  the 19 member countries of the paris club are owed about $5bn this year in debt repayments by nations affected by the indian ocean tsunami. indonesia  sri lanka and the seychelles accepted the paris club offer  which was criticised by some aid groups as being too little. thailand and india have however declined the offer  with thailand prefering to keep up with its payments while india said it would prefer to rely on its own resources rather than on international aid. putting off payments may lower a country s rating among financial organisations  making it more expensive and more difficult for them to borrow money in the future  analysts said. separately  the indonesian government has said it will announce monthly how much it has received in foreign donations and how it has spent the money. welfare minister alwi shihab told ap news agency that this announcement should allay suspicion of official corruption in relief operations.,indonesia declin debt freez indonesia longer need debt freez offer pari club group creditor econom minist aburiz bakri reportedli say indonesia origin accept debt moratorium offer owe pari club bn £bn mr bakri told bisni indonesia newspap bn donor aid packag meant debt moratorium unnecessari aid come top previouslypledg bn packag normal aid would use financ countri budget deficit indonesian econom minist explain money bn grant m soft loan rebuild aceh provinc badli hit tsunami decemb nevertheless one mr bakri deputi mahendra siregar told afp news agenc indonesia still consid offer pari club rich creditor nation temporarili suspend debt payment true still discus pari club decis find detail much debt subject moratorium far stage say mr siregar member countri pari club owe bn year debt repay nation affect indian ocean tsunami indonesia sri lanka seychel accept pari club offer criticis aid group littl thailand india howev declin offer thailand prefer keep payment india say would prefer reli resourc rather intern aid put payment may low countri rate among financi organis make expens difficult borrow money futur analyst say separ indonesian govern say announc monthli much receiv foreign donat spent money welfar minist alwi shihab told ap news agenc announc allay suspicion offici corrupt relief oper

61,760,gm pays $2bn to evade fiat buyout general motors of the us is to pay fiat 1.55bn euros ($2bn; £1.1bn) to get out of a deal which could have forced it to buy the italian car maker outright.  fiat had sold gm a stake in 2000  as part of a partnership agreement. but fiat s heavy losses have convinced gm - whose own european operations are in the red - to back away. the pay-off means the two firms will unwind joint ventures  but fiat will keep supplying diesel engines and the money will allow it to reduce its debt. fiat s shares on the milan stock exchange rose 4.5% by 0900 gmt to 6.2 euros  having shot up more than 7% in early trading.  we now have absolute freedom to design our own future   said fiat chief executive sergio marchionne.  analysts said fiat seemed to have done well out of the deal  although some predictions had expected a 2bn euro pay-off. fiat is to get 1bn euros immediately  with another 550m to follow within 90 days. the firm is italy s largest private employer  and a failure to reach an agreement could have had severe consequences for thousands of workers and for the italian economy. for its part  gm was keen to ward off any criticism that the deal had been a mistake.   we needed scale in europe to get costs down  and we were able to do that in working with fiat   said gm chief executive rick wagoner.  the fiat-gm alliance came about in 2000 as an alternative to selling fiat outright. german-us car firm daimlerchrysler had been willing to buy the firm  but fiat patriarch gianni agnelli did not want to give up control. instead  gm swapped a 6% stake in itself for 20% of fiat - and gave fiat a  put option  to sell gm the rest of the car maker between january 2004 and july 2009. but despite the alliance fiat failed to put itself back on track  continuing to lose money and market share. as a result  the sell-off looked better and better for the italians - and much worse for gm  which is struggling with its own loss-making european marques opel and saab. the relationship soured further after fiat sold half its finance arm and recapitalised in 2003  halving gm s stake to 10%.,gm pay bn evad fiat buyout gener motor u pay fiat bn euro bn £bn get deal could forc buy italian car maker outright fiat sell gm stake part partnership agreement fiat heavi loss convinc gm whose european oper red back away payoff mean two firm unwind joint ventur fiat keep suppli diesel engin money allow reduc debt fiat share milan stock exchang rise gmt euro shot earli trade absolut freedom design futur say fiat chief execut sergio marchionn analyst say fiat seem do well deal although predict expect bn euro payoff fiat get bn euro immedi anoth m follow within day firm itali large privat employ failur reach agreement could sever consequ thousand worker italian economi part gm keen ward critic deal mistak need scale europ get cost abl work fiat say gm chief execut rick wagon fiatgm allianc come altern sell fiat outright germanu car firm daimlerchrysl will buy firm fiat patriarch gianni agnelli want give control instead gm swap stake fiat give fiat put option sell gm rest car maker januari juli despit allianc fiat fail put back track continu lose money market share result selloff look well well italian much wors gm struggl lossmak european marqu opel saab relationship sour fiat sell half financ arm recapitalis halv gm stake

64,1342,georgia plans hidden asset pardon georgia is offering a one-off  tax amnesty  to people who hid their earnings under the regime of former president eduard shevardnadze.  the country s new president  mikhail saakashvili  has said that anyone now willing to disclose their wealth will only have to pay 1% in income tax. the measure is designed to legitimise previously hidden economic activity and boost georgia s flagging economy. georgia s black market is estimated to be twice the size of its legal economy.  mr saakashvili  elected president in january after mr shevardnadze was toppled  has urged the georgian parliament to approve the amnesty as soon as possible. it is one of a series of proposals designed to tackle corruption  which was rampant during the shevardnadze era  and boost georgia s fragile public finances.  the new government is encouraging companies to pay taxes by scrapping existing corruption investigations and destroying all tax records from before 1 january  three days before president saakashvili was elected.  there are people who have money but are afraid to show it   the president told a government session.  documentation about where this money came from doesn t exist because under the former  entirely warped regime  earning capital honestly was not possible.   by declaring their assets and paying the one-off tax  people would be able to  legalise their property   mr saakashvili stressed.   no one will have the right to check this money s origin. this money must go back into the economy.  the amnesty will not extend to people who made money through drugs trafficking or international money laundering. criminal investigations in such cases -thought to involve about 5% of georgian businesses -are to continue. mr saakashvili has accused the shevardnadze regime  which was toppled by a popular uprising in november  of allowing bribery to flourish. georgia s economy is in a desperate condition. half the population are living below the poverty line with many surviving on income of less than $4  or three euros  a day. the unemployment rate is around 20% while the country has a $1.7bn public debt.,georgia plan hidden asset pardon georgia offer oneoff tax amnesti peopl hid earn regim former presid eduard shevardnadz countri new presid mikhail saakashvili say anyon will disclos wealth pay incom tax measur design legitimis previous hidden econom activ boost georgia flag economi georgia black market estim twice size legal economi mr saakashvili elect presid januari mr shevardnadz toppl urg georgian parliament approv amnesti soon possibl one seri propos design tackl corrupt rampant shevardnadz era boost georgia fragil public financ new govern encourag compani pay tax scrap exist corrupt investig destroy tax record januari three day presid saakashvili elect peopl money afraid show presid told govern session document money come exist former entir warp regim earn capit honestli possibl declar asset pay oneoff tax peopl would abl legalis properti mr saakashvili stress one right check money origin money must go back economi amnesti extend peopl make money drug traffick intern money launder crimin investig case thought involv georgian busi continu mr saakashvili accus shevardnadz regim toppl popular upris novemb allow briberi flourish georgia economi desper condit half popul live poverti line mani surviv incom less three euro day unemploy rate around countri bn public debt

67,1824,qantas considers offshore option australian airline qantas could transfer as many as 7 000 jobs out of its home country as it seeks to save costs  according to newspaper reports.  chief executive geoff dixon was quoted by the australian newspaper as saying the carrier could no longer afford to remain  all-australian . unions criticised the possible move - which may affect cabin and maintenance staff - saying qantas was profitable. more than 90% of the airline s staff are based in australia.  qantas confirmed it was looking at whether it might recruit and source products overseas - potentially through joint ventures - but said it would continue to create jobs in australia.  despite making a record australian dollars 648m ($492m) profit last year  qantas has argued that it needs to make considerable savings if it is to remain competitive.  we re going to have to get the lowest cost structure we can and that willmean sourcing things more and more from overseas   the newspaper quoted qantas chief executive geoff dixon as saying. early this year  qantas increased the number of flight attendants based in london from 370 to 870. if qantas were to follow the lead of other airlines moving staff  offshore  7 000 jobs could shift overseas  the newspaper reported. in a statement  qantas said it was looking to build its operations overseas. however  it stressed this would not result in large scale redundancies in its home market  where most of its 35 000 staff are employed.  we are totally committed to continuing to grow jobs in australia   mr dixon said.  we are  however  operating in a global market and there is no room for complacency simply because we are currently profitable and successful.   unions reacted angrily to the reported disclosure  arguing that qantas was profitable and did not need to take such action.  we could understand if qantas was a struggling airline about to go under   michael mijatov  international division secretary of the flight attendants association  told agence france presse.  qantas announced a record profit last year and is on course this year for an even greater profit so it is totally unnecessary.  in an effort to meet the challenge posed by low cost carriers  qantas sought a tie-up with air new zealand last year however  the deal was thrown out by the new zealand high court on competition grounds.,qanta consid offshor option australian airlin qanta could transfer mani job home countri seek save cost accord newspap report chief execut geoff dixon quot australian newspap say carrier could longer afford remain allaustralian union criticis possibl move may affect cabin mainten staff say qanta profit airlin staff base australia qanta confirm look whether might recruit sourc product oversea potenti joint ventur say would continu creat job australia despit make record australian dollar m m profit last year qanta argu need make consider save remain competit go get low cost structur willmean sourc thing oversea newspap quot qanta chief execut geoff dixon say earli year qanta increas number flight attend base london qanta follow lead airlin move staff offshor job could shift oversea newspap report statement qanta say look build oper oversea howev stress would result larg scale redund home market staff employ total commit continu grow job australia mr dixon say howev oper global market room complac simpli current profit success union react angrili report disclosur argu qanta profit need take action could understand qanta struggl airlin go michael mijatov intern divis secretari flight attend associ told agenc franc press qanta announc record profit last year cours year even great profit total unnecessari effort meet challeng pose low cost carrier qanta sought tieup air new zealand last year howev deal thrown new zealand high court competit ground
68,1546,labour faces  cold calls  inquiry labour is to be investigated by a watchdog over claims its election campaign has broken the rules on  cold calling  householders.  the information commissioner is to look into a complaint from the lib dems about how labour uses its call centres. the lib dems say labour is telephoning people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing calls. labour denies breaking rules. it says calls are not marketing if they just ask about people s voting intentions. the party says it would expect the watchdog to take complaints seriously but it has clear legal advice on the issue.  telephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the run-up to the general election. but seven million telephone numbers are on the telephone preference service (tps) lists  which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls. lib dem chairman matthew taylor has written to the watchdog accusing labour of a  flagrant and systematic breach  of the laws governing the tps.  he says the initial call may not be marketing but it identifies voters to whom the party can send promotional material in the future. his letter to the commissioner quotes from a labour party handbook about  identifying target voters . and it quotes a stevenage labour party members  newsletter explaining how voters will be telephoned about their voting intentions.  the voters are put in 24 categories according to their last known voting intention  ranging from  labour (firm)  to  target (conservative)  - those who supported the party in the past but this time will be voting tory. the newsletter says:  using the information we know about people  we can send them direct mailings.  for example  we could send the target (conservative) people a letter from someone who had defected from the tories to labour explaining the reasons why voting tory is a bad idea or we could send labour (weak) people a letter encouraging them to sign up for a postal vote.   mr taylor tells the commissioner:  it is clear beyond peradventure from the above that the labour party is engaging in a large-scale voter id project for subsequent promotional purposes through targeted and segmented mailings.  insofar as this project is directed at tps subscribers  it is equally clear that it is unlawful.  the lib dems raised worries about labour and conservative calls in february and 680 people have signed up to the website they set up to help people to complain. a party official said there was only scattered evidence of the tories breaking the rules but people had complained every day about labour.  a spokeswoman for the information commissioner s office said it was examining one complaint about political calls - understood to be mr taylor s.  we are investigating one of the complaints where some evidence has been given to us   she said.  obviously evidence is needed for us to start investigations.  the commissioner s office will now examine the lib dem evidence.  the guidance is that cold calling can be made as long as no marketing is going on   said the spokeswoman. if labour is judged to have broken the rules  it will be asked stop immediately. if it fails to do so after two or three warning letters  the commissioner can issue an enforcement notice spelling out what the party needs to do or stop doing.  the party could appeal against the decision to an information tribunal. if the appeal fails and it continues breaking the rules  it could be fined up to £5 000. labour says it avoids those on tps lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising but not when making  voter identification  calls. asked about the commissioner s inquiry  a labour spokesman told bbc news:  we expect the information commissioner to take any complaint seriously. however  we are absolutely clear that we haven t broken any rules.  as the information commissioner himself has said  if people are not marketing something  if they are asking them which way they are going to vote  they are not in breach of the law.  we always ask everyone we phone up whether they would be happy to be contacted by the labour party again.,labour face cold call inquiri labour investig watchdog claim elect campaign broken rule cold call household inform commission look complaint lib dem labour use call centr lib dem say labour telephon peopl sign make sure get market call labour deni break rule say call market ask peopl vote intent parti say would expect watchdog take complaint serious clear legal advic issu telephon call centr expect use never three major parti runup gener elect seven million telephon number telephon prefer servic tp list ban unsolicit sale market call lib dem chairman matthew taylor write watchdog accus labour flagrant systemat breach law govern tp say initi call may market identifi voter parti send promot materi futur letter commission quot labour parti handbook identifi target voter quot stevenag labour parti member newslett explain voter telephon vote intent voter put categori accord last know vote intent rang labour firm target conserv support parti past time vote torus newslett say use inform know peopl send direct mail exampl could send target conserv peopl letter someon defect torus labour explain reason vote torus bad idea could send labour weak peopl letter encourag sign postal vote mr taylor tell commission clear beyond peradventur labour parti engag largescal voter id project subsequ promot purpos target segment mail insofar project direct tp subscrib equal clear unlaw lib dem rais worri labour conserv call februari peopl sign websit set help peopl complain parti offici say scatter evid torus break rule peopl complain everi day labour spokeswoman inform commission offic say examin one complaint polit call understood mr taylor investig one complaint evid give u say obvious evid need u start investig commission offic examin lib dem evid guidanc cold call make long market go say spokeswoman labour judg broken rule ask stop immedi fail two three warn letter commission issu enforc notic spell parti need stop parti could appeal decis inform tribun appeal fail continu break rule could fine £ labour say avoid tp list telephon peopl membership fundrais make voter identif call ask commission inquiri labour spokesman told bbc news expect inform commission take complaint serious howev absolut clear broken rule inform commission say peopl market someth ask way go vote breach law alway ask everyon phone whether would happi contact labour parti
69,1118,tsunami slows sri lanka s growth sri lanka s president has launched a reconstruction drive worth $3.5bn (£1.8bn) by appealing for peace and national unity.  president kumaratunga said it was now important to find a peaceful solution to years of internal conflict. meanwhile  the international monetary fund (imf) said damage from the tsunami would cut one percentage point from sri lanka s economic growth this year. it estimated the wave left physical damage equal to 6.5% of the economy.  separately  the international labour organisation (ilo) said that at least one million people have lost their livelihoods in sri lanka and indonesia alone. it called for action to create jobs. president kumaratunga attended a ceremony in the southern town of hambantota. she was joined by government and opposition politicians  together with buddhist  hindu  muslim and christian clergy.  prime minister mahinda rajapakse laid the foundation stone on a new housing project intended to provide 6 000 homes for survivors of the tsunami. mrs kumaratunga called for the tragedy to be  the start of a new beginning to rebuild our nation .  we are a country blessed with so many natural resources and we have not made use of them fully. instead we have been squabbling  fighting   she added. norway s peace negotiator erik solheim is due to arrive on wednesday to try to revive peace talks in the decades-long conflict between government forces and the tamil tigers  who want a separate state in the north east of the country. reconstruction efforts in eastern sri lanka have been hampered by tensions between the two sides.  the imf said that the sri lankan authorities  initial estimates have put the physical damage at $1.3 to $1.5bn  but added that the implications for the economy were much wider than this.  the broader macroeconomic impact will clearly be substantial but the details are difficult to assess at this early stage   the imf said. growth  inflation  the balance of payments and foreign exchange reserves are all expected to show the effects of lost businesses and reconstruction costs.  the fishing industry has been devastated  agricultural production may be affected and tourism will suffer  especially in the short term   the report said. the ilo estimated that 400 000 sri lankans have lost their jobs  mostly in these three industries. earnings from tourism this year are expected to be 15% lower than last year. economic growth this year is expected to be 4%  which is about 1% less than previously forecast. inflation could climb to 14% compared to a previous estimate of 12%. although major exports have not suffered  the imf expects the reconstruction effort will require higher imports which could damage the balance of payments. foreign exchange reserves may become strained as  sri lanka will be hard pressed to keep international reserves at the pre-tsunami level  which totalled more than two months worth of imports. last week  the imf approved sri lanka s request for a freeze on loan repayments.,tsunami slow sri lanka growth sri lanka presid launch reconstruct drive worth bn £bn appeal peac nation uniti presid kumaratunga say import find peac solut year intern conflict meanwhil intern monetari fund imf say damag tsunami would cut one percentag point sri lanka econom growth year estim wave left physic damag equal economi separ intern labour organis ilo say least one million peopl lose livelihood sri lanka indonesia alon call action creat job presid kumaratunga attend ceremoni southern town hambantota join govern opposit politician togeth buddhist hindu muslim christian clergi prime minist mahinda rajapaks laid foundat stone new hous project intend provid home survivor tsunami mr kumaratunga call tragedi start new begin rebuild nation countri bless mani natur resourc make use fulli instead squabbl fight ad norway peac negoti erik solheim due arriv wednesday tri reviv peac talk decadeslong conflict govern forc tamil tiger want separ state north east countri reconstruct effort eastern sri lanka hamper tension two side imf say sri lankan author initi estim put physic damag bn ad implic economi much wider broader macroeconom impact clearli substanti detail difficult ass earli stage imf say growth inflat balanc payment foreign exchang reserv expect show effect lose busi reconstruct cost fish industri devast agricultur product may affect tourism suffer especi short term report say ilo estim sri lankan lose job mostli three industri earn tourism year expect low last year econom growth year expect less previous forecast inflat could climb compar previou estim although major export suffer imf expect reconstruct effort requir high import could damag balanc payment foreign exchang reserv may becom strain sri lanka hard press keep intern reserv pretsunami level total two month worth import last week imf approv sri lanka request freez loan repay

73,1395,bad e-mail habits sustains spam the  bad behaviour  of e-mail users is helping to sustain the spam industry  a new study has found.  according to a survey conducted by security firm mirapoint and market research company the radicati group  nearly a third of e-mail users have clicked on links in spam messages. one in ten users have bought products advertised in junk mail. clicking on a link in a spam message can expose people to viruses and alert spammers to live e-mail accounts.  the fact that one in ten e-mail users are buying things advertised in spam continues to make it an attractive business  especially given that sending out huge amounts of spam costs very little  the report concludes.  this preliminary data is surprising and somewhat shocking to us   said marcel nienhuis  market analyst at the radicati group.  it explains why e-mail security threats including spam  viruses and phishing scams continue to proliferate   he said  accusing users of  bad e-mail behaviour . spammers are increasingly hooking into whatever happens to be flavour of the month  according to security firm clearswift. it has recently seen a rise in the number of spam messages offering phoney sony psp giveaways. and  in perhaps a nod to the popularity of the american drama series desperate housewives  it has also seen a dramatic rise in junk mails purporting to give details of women looking for casual sex. but rather than finding a companion  users who click on such mail will find themselves redirected to porn sites  where they run the risk of downloading spyware on to their pc. clearswift has seen a 180% rise in sex-related spam over the course of the last month.  without casting aspersions  those likely to respond to these kind of adverts will be invariably hoping that  one thing leads to another  but aside from the fact that these mails are bogus  clicking on any link within a spam mail can lead to a whole host of unwanted problems   said alyn hockey  clearswift s director of research.  sexually explicit terms make up 14% of security firm sophos  top 50 word that spammers most commonly try to disguise in order to beat anti-spam filters. spammers will deliberately misspell a word or use digits instead of letters in an attempt to by-pass anti-spam software  said graham cluley  senior technology consultant for security firm sophos.  the list of words most commonly hidden by the spammers from anti-spam software reveals that most spam is about the old favourites: money  drugs and sex   said mr cluley. but anti-spam filters can only be part of the solution to the menace of junk e-mail.  people must resist their basic instincts to buy from spam mails. spammers are criminals  plain and simple. if no-one responded to junk e-mail and didn t buy products sold in this way  then spam would be as extinct as the dinosaurs   he said.,bad email habit sustain spam bad behaviour email user help sustain spam industri new studi found accord survey conduct secur firm mirapoint market research compani radicati group nearli third email user click link spam messag one ten user bought product advertis junk mail click link spam messag expo peopl virus alert spammer live email account fact one ten email user buy thing advertis spam continu make attract busi especi give send huge amount spam cost littl report conclud preliminari data surpris somewhat shock u say marcel nienhui market analyst radicati group explain email secur threat includ spam virus phish scam continu prolifer say accus user bad email behaviour spammer increasingli hook whatev happen flavour month accord secur firm clearswift recent see rise number spam messag offer phoney soni psp giveaway perhap nod popular american drama seri desper housew also see dramat rise junk mail purport give detail woman look casual sex rather find companion user click mail find redirect porn site run risk download spywar pc clearswift see rise sexrel spam cours last month without cast asper like respond kind advert invari hope one thing lead anoth asid fact mail bogu click link within spam mail lead whole host unwant problem say alyn hockey clearswift director research sexual explicit term make secur firm sopho top word spammer commonli tri disguis order beat antispam filter spammer deliber misspel word use digit instead letter attempt bypass antispam softwar say graham cluley senior technolog consult secur firm sopho list word commonli hidden spammer antispam softwar reveal spam old favourit money drug sex say mr cluley antispam filter part solut menac junk email peopl must resist basic instinct buy spam mail spammer crimin plain simpl noon respond junk email buy product sell way spam would extinct dinosaur say

75,2096,souped-up wi-fi is on the horizon super high-speed wireless data networks could soon be in use in the uk.  the government s wireless watchdog is seeking help on the best way to regulate the technology behind such networks called ultra wideband (uwb). ofcom wants to ensure that the arrival of uwb-using devices does not cause problems for those that already use the same part of the radio spectrum. uwb makes it possible to stream huge amounts of data through the air over short distances. one of the more likely uses of uwb is to make it possible to send dvd quality video images wirelessly to tv screens or to let people beam music to media players around their home. the technology has the potential to transmit hundreds of megabits of data per second. uwb could also be used to create so-called personal area networks that let a person s gadgets quickly and easily swap data amongst themselves. the technology works over a range up to 10 metres and uses billions of short radio pulses every second to carry data. at the recent consumer electronics show in las vegas products with uwb chips built-in got their first public airing.  currently  use of uwb is only allowed in the uk under a strict licencing scheme.  we re seeking opinion from industry to find out whether or not we should allow uwb on a licence-exempt basis   said a spokesman for ofcom.  companies have until 24 march to respond. in april the ec is due to start its own consultation on europe-wide adoption of uwb. the cross-europe body for radio regulators  known as the european conference of postal and telecommunications administrations (cept)  is carrying out research for this harmonisation programme. early sight of the cept work has caused controversy as some think it over-emphasises uwb s potential to interfere with existing users. by contrast a preliminary ofcom report found that it would be quite straight-forward to deploy uwb without causing problems for those that already use it. the ofcom spokesman said it was considering imposing a  mask  or set of technical restrictions on uwb-using devices.  we would want these devices to have very strict controls on power levels so they can not transmit a long way or over a wide area   he said. despite the current restrictions the technology is already being used. cambridge-based ubisense has about 40 customers around the world using the short-range radio technology  said david theriault  standards and regulatory liaison for ubisense. he said that uwb was driving novel ways to interact with computers.  it s like having a 3d mouse all the time   he said. he said that european decisions on what to do with uwb allied with ieee decisions on the exact specifications for it would help drive adoption. prior to its adoption as a way for gadgets and computers to communicate  uwb was used as a sensing technology. it is used to spot such things as cracks under the surface of runways or to help firemen detect people through walls.,soupedup wifi horizon super highspe wireless data network could soon use uk govern wireless watchdog seek help best way regul technolog behind network call ultra wideband uwb ofcom want ensur arriv uwbus devic caus problem alreadi use part radio spectrum uwb make possibl stream huge amount data air short distanc one like use uwb make possibl send dvd qualiti video imag wirelessli tv screen let peopl beam music medium player around home technolog potenti transmit hundr megabit data per second uwb could also use creat socal person area network let person gadget quickli easili swap data amongst technolog work rang metr use billion short radio pul everi second carri data recent consum electron show la vega product uwb chip builtin get first public air current use uwb allow uk strict licenc scheme seek opinion industri find whether allow uwb licenceexempt basi say spokesman ofcom compani march respond april ec due start consult europewid adopt uwb crosseurop bodi radio regul know european confer postal telecommun administr cept carri research harmonis programm earli sight cept work caus controversi think overemphasis uwb potenti interfer exist user contrast preliminari ofcom report found would quit straightforward deploy uwb without caus problem alreadi use ofcom spokesman say consid impos mask set technic restrict uwbus devic would want devic strict control power level transmit long way wide area say despit current restrict technolog alreadi use cambridgebas ubisens custom around world use shortrang radio technolog say david theriault standard regulatori liaison ubisens say uwb drive novel way interact comput like d mous time say say european decis uwb alli ieee decis exact specif would help drive adopt prior adopt way gadget comput commun uwb use sen technolog use spot thing crack surfac runway help fireman detect peopl wall
76,1182,apple unveils low-cost  mac mini  apple has unveiled a new  low-cost macintosh computer for the masses  billed as the mac mini.  chief executive steve jobs showed off the new machine at his annual macworld speech  in san francisco. the $499 macintosh  sold for £339 in the uk  was described by jobs as the  most important mac  made by apple. mr jobs also unveiled the ipod shuffle  a new music player using cheaper flash memory rather than hard drives  which are used in more expensive ipods.  the new computer shifts the company into new territory - traditionally  the firm is known as a design and innovation-led firm rather than as a mass-market manufacturer. the mac mini comes without a monitor  keyboard and mouse  and a second version with a larger hard drive will also be sold for $599.  the machine - which will be available from 22 january - was described by jobs as  byodkm... bring your own display  keyboard  and mouse . in an attempt to win over windows pc customers  mr jobs said it would appeal to people thinking of changing operating systems.  people who are thinking of switching will have no more excuses   he said.  it s the newest and most affordable mac ever.  the new computer has been the subject of speculation for several weeks and while few people will be surprised by the announcement many analysts had already said it was a sensible move. in january  apple sued a website after it published what it said were specifications for the new computer. ian harris  deputy editor of uk magazine mac format  said the machine would appeal to pc-owning consumers who had purchased an ipod.   they want a further taste of mac because they like what they have seen with ipod.  harris added:  everybody thought that apple was happy to remain a niche maker of luxury computers  and moving into a market dominated by low margin manufacturers like dell is a bold move.  but it shows that apple is keen to capitalise on the mass market success it s had with the ipod. the mac mini will appeal to pc users looking for an attractive   no fuss  computer.  the new ipod shuffle comes in two versions - one offering 512mb of storage for $99 (£69 in the uk) and a second with one gigabyte of storage for $149 (£99) - and went on sale tuesday. the music player has no display and will play songs either consecutively or shuffled. the smaller ipod will hold about 120 songs  said mr jobs. mr jobs told the delegates at macworld that ipod already had a 65% market share of all digital music players.,appl unveil lowcost mac mini appl unveil new lowcost macintosh comput mass bill mac mini chief execut steve job show new machin annual macworld speech san francisco macintosh sell £ uk describ job import mac make appl mr job also unveil ipod shuffl new music player use cheaper flash memori rather hard drive use expens ipod new comput shift compani new territori tradit firm know design innovationl firm rather massmarket manufactur mac mini come without monitor keyboard mous second version large hard drive also sell machin avail januari describ job byodkm bring display keyboard mous attempt win window pc custom mr job say would appeal peopl think chang oper system peopl think switch excus say new afford mac ever new comput subject specul sever week peopl surpris announc mani analyst alreadi say sensibl move januari appl su websit publish say specif new comput ian harri deputi editor uk magazin mac format say machin would appeal pcown consum purchas ipod want tast mac like see ipod harri ad everybodi thought appl happi remain nich maker luxuri comput move market domin low margin manufactur like dell bold move show appl keen capitalis mass market success ipod mac mini appeal pc user look attract fuss comput new ipod shuffl come two version one offer mb storag £ uk second one gigabyt storag £ go sale tuesday music player display play song either consecut shuffl small ipod hold song say mr job mr job told deleg macworld ipod alreadi market share digit music player
77,1683,blair rejects iraq advice calls tony blair has rejected calls for the publication of advice on the legality of the iraq war amid growing calls for an investigation.  the prime minister told his monthly press conference the matter had been dealt with by the attorney general. earlier  conservative mp michael mates joined calls for a probe into claims lord goldsmith s statement to parliament was drawn up at number 10. mr blair said the statement was a  fair summary  of lord goldsmith s opinion.   that s what he (lord goldsmith) said and that s what i say. he has dealt with this time and time and time again   mr blair told his monthly news conference in downing street. he refused to answer further questions on the issue  saying it had been dealt with  literally scores of times and the position has not changed . lord goldsmith has denied being  leaned on  and says the words written were his.  the government refuses to publish his advice on the legality of the war - saying such papers have always been kept confidential. mr mates  who is a member of the commons intelligence and security committee and was part of the butler inquiry into pre-war intelligence  told the bbc on friday:  that  as a general rule  is right  but it s not an absolute rule.  he said there had been other occasions when advice had been published  most recently regarding prince charles s marriage plans. the government could not pick and choose when to use the convention  he said.  mr mates added:  we discovered that there were two or three occasions in the past when law officers  advice to the government has been published.  and this may be one of those special occasions... when it would be in the public interest to see the advice which the attorney general gave to the prime minister.  this is argument was rejected by mr blair  who said:  firstly  we haven t broken the precedent  and secondly peter goldsmith has made his statement and i have got absolutely nothing to add to it.  in a book published this week  philippe sands qc  a member of cherie blair s matrix chambers  says lord goldsmith warned tony blair on 7 march 2003 that the iraq war could be illegal without a second un resolution sanctioning military action.  but a short statement about lord goldsmith s position was presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 march 2003 - just before a crucial commons vote on the military action. mr sands  book suggests it was actually written by home office minister lord falconer and downing street adviser baroness morgan. former minister clare short  who resigned from the government over the iraq war  said it was the same statement that was earlier shown to the cabinet as it discussed military action. she told the bbc the full advice should have been attached  according to the ministerial code.   my view is we need the house of lords to set up a special committee  summon the attorney  get all the papers out  look at exactly what happened   she said. the conservatives and liberal democrats say they want the publication of the full legal advice given by the attorney general. on thursday  lord goldsmith said his statement had not been  written by or at number 10 .  in my parliamentary answer on march 17 2003  i explained my genuinely held independent view  that military action was lawful under the existing security council resolutions   he said.,blair reject iraq advic call toni blair reject call public advic legal iraq war amid grow call investig prime minist told monthli press confer matter dealt attorney gener earlier conserv mp michael mate join call probe claim lord goldsmith statement parliament drawn number mr blair say statement fair summari lord goldsmith opinion lord goldsmith say say dealt time time time mr blair told monthli news confer down street refus answer question issu say dealt liter score time posit chang lord goldsmith deni lean say word write govern refus publish advic legal war say paper alway kept confidenti mr mate member common intellig secur committe part butler inquiri prewar intellig told bbc friday gener rule right absolut rule say occas advic publish recent regard princ charl marriag plan govern could pick choos use convent say mr mate ad discov two three occas past law offic advic govern publish may one special occas would public interest see advic attorney gener give prime minist argument reject mr blair say firstli broken preced secondli peter goldsmith make statement get absolut noth add book publish week philipp sand qc member cheri blair matrix chamber say lord goldsmith warn toni blair march iraq war could illeg without second un resolut sanction militari action short statement lord goldsmith posit present write parliamentari answer march crucial common vote militari action mr sand book suggest actual write home offic minist lord falcon down street advis baro morgan former minist clare short resign govern iraq war say statement earlier show cabinet discus militari action told bbc full advic attach accord ministeri code view need hous lord set special committe summon attorney get paper look exactli happen say conserv liber democrat say want public full legal advic give attorney gener thursday lord goldsmith say statement write number parliamentari answer march explain genuin held independ view militari action law exist secur council resolut say

80,1796,us tv cuts nudity from bbc film a us tv network is editing bbc films  dirty war to avoid showing the front of a nude woman being scrubbed down after a fictional chemical attack.  it is not worth showing  non-essential  nude scenes when indecency complaints are  aggressively pursued  by us tv watchdogs  said pbs  jacoba atlas. dirty war - screened uncut on bbc one last september - depicts a dirty bomb attack on the city of london. it is also being screened uncut on us cable channel hbo on 24 january. pbs said it will use extra footage for its broadcast  showing the woman  from a more discreet angle  instead.  the us federal communications commission fined cbs $550 000 (£306 814) last autumn for singer janet jackson s  wardrobe malfunction   during which her breast was exposed during a dance routine with justin timberlake. many us networks and broadcasters are now more nervous about airing nudity  violence or bad language. ms atlas said pbs could put itself financially at risk if it showed the uncut version of dirty war  and it could also deter many of its 170 individual stations from airing  an important film .  you want to pick your battles   she said. she added that pbs  which is a private  non-profit media enterprise owned and operated by the nation s 349 public television stations  is bolder about screening non-fiction or historical programming. pbs is seen in virtually all us homes with tv  and describes itself as a  trusted community resource  serving nearly 100 million people each week.,u tv cut nuditi bbc film u tv network edit bbc film dirti war avoid show front nude woman scrub fiction chemic attack worth show nonessenti nude scene indec complaint aggress pursu u tv watchdog say pb jacoba atla dirti war screen uncut bbc one last septemb depict dirti bomb attack citi london also screen uncut u cabl channel hbo januari pb say use extra footag broadcast show woman discreet angl instead u feder commun commiss fine cb £ last autumn singer janet jackson wardrob malfunct breast expo danc routin justin timberlak mani u network broadcast nervou air nuditi violenc bad languag m atla say pb could put financi risk show uncut version dirti war could also deter mani individu station air import film want pick battl say ad pb privat nonprofit medium enterpris own oper nation public televis station bolder screen nonfict histor program pb see virtual u home tv describ trust commun resourc serv nearli million peopl week
81,25,mobile audio enters new dimension as mobile phones move closer to being a ubiquitous  all-in-one media player  audio is becoming ever more important. but how good can that sound be from such a small device   the sound of a buzzing bee jumps from left to right before disappearing around the back of my head. the surround sound demo is unremarkable when heard on a multi-speaker home cinema system but startling when emerging from a small mobile phone. british firm sonaptic is one of a number of companies to have developed 3d audio technology that emerges from stereo speakers. firms am3d and srs both offer stereo-widening technology for mobile phones. but sonaptic s managing director david monteith says his firm is the only company to offer positional 3d audio on a mobile.   there are quite a few basic technologies out there  making the sound seem a bit bigger  headphones a bit nicer.   no-one has really tried before to make proper 3d positional audio - where an individual channel can be moved around.  sonaptic has been working with japanese mobile network ntt docomo to set standards for 3d audio on mobile phones. in the last few months handsets from nec  fujitsu and mitsubishi have been released on to the japanese marker which have chips produced by yamaha and rohm with sonaptic s technology.  the technology has been around on pcs and games consoles for some time but what we are doing is making it more efficient so it can go on a small consumer device like a mobile phone   said mr monteith.  the technology works through applying the science of psychoacoustics and grew out of medical research done by the company s research director dr alastair sibbald.  we are basically trying to fool your ears into thinking sound is coming from areas it actually isn t.  your brain uses certain bits of information which we are effectively synthesising on a mobile phone handset.  the structure of the ear works as a 3d encoder for sound - helping the brain understand from where sound is emanating. sonaptic s audio processing algorithms mimic that 3d encoding  giving the impression that sound is coming from the left  right  and behind a listener when in fact it is coming from a single source. mr montieth says:  if the sound is off to one side it will get to one ear before the other - if it is on the right it has to bend around your head to get to your left ear.   the shape of your ear causes differences in sound from one ear to the other. we are synthesising those differences.  sonaptic hopes the technology will have a big impact in the growing market of mobile gaming and music downloading.  handhelds often have limitations - screens will be small by definition.  if you want to get impact from media you are running - either a movie  a game or watching tv - if you want it to be more immersive then our technology can help.  a fishing game is the first title to use the technology  creating a 3d sound field while the gamer plays. driving games and shoot  em ups using the technology are in development. the technology can also be used for music - giving songs a much more expansive and immersive feel. sonaptic offers its technology on a chip or in software and is about to release a new version which significantly improves the efficiency of the audio processing.  it s important we only use 10 or 15% of the processor otherwise you won t be able to play a game on the handset   explained mr montieth. the company is now looking to the us and european markets  where it has been working with network vodafone.  we have focused first on japan because it has a very advanced mobile phone market.  we knew japan would be the first place to have the handsets that could use our technology.  there should be handsets out in the uk in the next six months.,mobil audio enter new dimens mobil phone move closer ubiquit allinon medium player audio becom ever import good sound small devic sound buzz bee jump left right disappear around back head surround sound demo unremark heard multispeak home cinema system startl emerg small mobil phone british firm sonapt one number compani develop d audio technolog emerg stereo speaker firm amd sr offer stereowiden technolog mobil phone sonapt manag director david monteith say firm compani offer posit d audio mobil quit basic technolog make sound seem bit big headphon bit nicer noon realli tri make proper d posit audio individu channel move around sonapt work japanes mobil network ntt docomo set standard d audio mobil phone last month handset nec fujitsu mitsubishi releas japanes marker chip produc yamaha rohm sonapt technolog technolog around pc game consol time make effici go small consum devic like mobil phone say mr monteith technolog work appli scienc psychoacoust grow medic research do compani research director dr alastair sibbald basic tri fool ear think sound come area actual brain use certain bit inform effect synthesis mobil phone handset structur ear work d encod sound help brain understand sound eman sonapt audio process algorithm mimic d encod give impress sound come left right behind listen fact come singl sourc mr montieth say sound one side get one ear right bend around head get left ear shape ear caus differ sound one ear synthesis differ sonapt hope technolog big impact grow market mobil game music download handheld often limit screen small definit want get impact medium run either movi game watch tv want immers technolog help fish game first titl use technolog creat d sound field gamer play drive game shoot em up use technolog develop technolog also use music give song much expans immers feel sonapt offer technolog chip softwar releas new version significantli improv effici audio process import use processor otherwis abl play game handset explain mr montieth compani look u european market work network vodafon focus first japan advanc mobil phone market knew japan would first place handset could use technolog handset uk next six month

85,291,yukos seeks court action on sale yukos will return to a us court on wednesday to seek sanctions against baikal finance group  the little-known firm which has bought its main asset.  yukos has said it will sue baikal and others involved in the sale of yuganskneftegas for $20bn in damages. yukos  us lawyers will attempt to have baikal assets frozen after the russian government ignored a us court order last week blocking the sale. baikal s background and its motives for buying the unit are still unclear.  russian newspapers have claimed that baikal - which bought the yuganskneftegas production unit for $9.4bn (261bn roubles  £4.8bn) on sunday at a state provoked auction - has strong links with surgutneftegas  russia s fourth-biggest oil producer. many observers believe that the unit  which produces 60% of yukos  oil output  could ultimately fall into the hands of surgutneftegas or even gazprom  the state gas firm which opted out of the auction.  the russian government forced the sale of yukos  most lucrative asset as part of its action to enforce a $27bn back tax bill it says the company owes. yukos  us lawyers claim the auction was illegal because the firm had filed for bankruptcy and therefore its assets were now under the protection of us bankruptcy law which has worldwide jurisdiction. on wednesday  yukos will also seek further legal remedies to prevent the break-up of the group.  we believe the auction was illegal and we intend to pursue all legal recourses available to us   yukos spokesman mike lake told agence france press.  if it exports that oil  it will be marketing a stolen product   he added. the future ownership of yuganksneftegas remains unclear amid widespread suggestions that baikal was established as a front for other interests.  speaking on tuesday  president putin said baikal was owned by individual investors who planned to build relationships with other russian energy firms interested in the development of yuganskneftegas. president putin also suggested that china s national petroleum corporation could play a role in the unit s future after signing a commercial agreement with gazprom to work on joint energy projects. yukos has claimed that the sale of its main asset will lead to the collapse of the company. commentators and yukos itself claim the firm is the target of a government campaign to destroy it because of the political ambitions of its founder  mikhail khodorkovsky.,yuko seek court action sale yuko return u court wednesday seek sanction baikal financ group littleknown firm bought main asset yuko say sue baikal other involv sale yuganskneftega bn damag yuko u lawyer attempt baikal asset frozen russian govern ignor u court order last week block sale baikal background motiv buy unit still unclear russian newspap claim baikal bought yuganskneftega product unit bn bn roubl £bn sunday state provok auction strong link surgutneftega russia fourthbiggest oil produc mani observ believ unit produc yuko oil output could ultim fall hand surgutneftega even gazprom state ga firm opt auction russian govern forc sale yuko lucr asset part action enforc bn back tax bill say compani owe yuko u lawyer claim auction illeg firm file bankruptci therefor asset protect u bankruptci law worldwid jurisdict wednesday yuko also seek legal remedi prevent breakup group believ auction illeg intend pursu legal recours avail u yuko spokesman mike lake told agenc franc press export oil market steal product ad futur ownership yuganksneftega remain unclear amid widespread suggest baikal establish front interest speak tuesday presid putin say baikal own individu investor plan build relationship russian energi firm interest develop yuganskneftega presid putin also suggest china nation petroleum corpor could play role unit futur sign commerci agreement gazprom work joint energi project yuko claim sale main asset lead collaps compani comment yuko claim firm target govern campaign destroy polit ambit founder mikhail khodorkovski

87,2171,games win for blu-ray dvd format the next-generation dvd format blu-ray is winning more supporters than its rival  according to its backers.  blu-ray  backed by 100 firms including sony  is competing against toshiba and nec-backed hd-dvd to be the format of choice for future films and games. the blu-ray association said on thursday that games giants electronic arts and vivendi would both support its dvd format. the next generation of dvds will hold high-definition video and sound. this offers incredible 3d-like quality of pictures which major hollywood studios and games publishers are extremely keen to exploit in the coming year. in a separate press conference at the consumer electronics show in las vegas  toshiba announced that dvd players for its technology would be on the market by the end of 2005.   as we move from standard definition video images to high-definition images  we have a much greater need for storage   richard doherty  from panasonic s hollywood laboratories  one of the pioneers of blu-ray  told the bbc news website.  so by utilising blue laser-based technology we can make an optical laser disc that can hold six times as much as today s dvd.  a blu-ray disc will be able to store 50gb of high-quality data  while toshiba s hd-dvd will hold 30gb. mr doherty added that it was making sure the discs could satisfy all high-definition needs  including the ability to record onto the dvds and smaller discs to fit into camcorders. both toshiba and blu-ray are hopeful that the emerging dvd format war  akin to the betamax and vhs fight in the 1980s  can be resolved over the next year when next-generation dvd players start to come out. when players do come out  they will be able to play standard dvds too  which is good news for those who have huge libraries of current dvds.  but the support from vivendi and electronics arts is a big boost to blu-ray in the battle for supremacy.  gaming is a $20 billion industry worldwide  so is as crucial as the film industry in terms of money to be made.  the technical requirement for game development today demands more advanced optical-disc technologies   said michael heilmann  chief technology officer for vivendi universal.  blu-ray offers the capacity  performance and high-speed internet connectivity to take us into the future of gaming.  ea  a leading games developer and publisher  added that the delivery of high-definition games of the future was vital and blu-ray had the capacity  functionality and interactivity needed for the kinds of projects it was planning. sony recently announced it would be using the technology in its next generation of playstations. mr doherty said gamers were  ravenous  for high-quality graphics and technology for the next generation of titles.  gamers  especially those working on pcs  are always focused on more capacity to deliver textures  deeper levels  for delivering higher-resolution playback.   he added:  the focus for games moving forward is on increased immersion.   gaming companies really like to focus on creating a world which involves creating complicated 3d models and textures and increasing the resolution  increasing the frame rate - all of these are part of getting a more immersive experience.  fitting these models on current dvd technologies means compressing the graphics so much that much of this quality is lost. as games move to more photo-real capability  the current technology is limiting.  they are thrilled at the advanced capacity to start to build these immersive environments   said mr doherty. currently  graphics-intensive pc games also require multiple discs for installation. high-definition dvds will cut down on that need. likewise  consoles rely on single discs  so dvds that can hold six times more data mean much better  high-resolution games. blu-ray has already won backing from major hollywood studios  such as mgm studios  disney  and buena vista  as well as top technology firms like dell  lg  samsung and phillips amongst others. while toshiba s hd-dvd technology has won backing from paramount  universal and warner bros.  the real world benefits (of hd-dvd) are apparent and obvious   said jim cardwell  president of warner home video. mr cardwell added that rapid time to market and dependability were significant factors in choosing to go with hd-dvd. both formats are courting microsoft to be the format of choice for the next generation xbox  but discussions are still on-going. next generation dvds will also be able to store images and other data. ces is the largest consumer electronics show in the world  and runs from 6 to 9 january.,game win bluray dvd format nextgener dvd format bluray win support rival accord backer bluray back firm includ soni compet toshiba necback hddvd format choic futur film game bluray associ say thursday game giant electron art vivendi would support dvd format next gener dvd hold highdefinit video sound offer incred dlike qualiti pictur major hollywood studio game publish extrem keen exploit come year separ press confer consum electron show la vega toshiba announc dvd player technolog would market end move standard definit video imag highdefinit imag much great need storag richard doherti panason hollywood laboratori one pioneer bluray told bbc news websit utilis blue laserbas technolog make optic laser disc hold six time much today dvd bluray disc abl store gb highqual data toshiba hddvd hold gb mr doherti ad make sure disc could satisfi highdefinit need includ abil record onto dvd small disc fit camcord toshiba bluray hope emerg dvd format war akin betamax vh fight s resolv next year nextgener dvd player start come player come abl play standard dvd good news huge librari current dvd support vivendi electron art big boost bluray battl supremaci game billion industri worldwid crucial film industri term money make technic requir game develop today demand advanc opticaldisc technolog say michael heilmann chief technolog offic vivendi univers bluray offer capac perform highspe internet connect take u futur game ea lead game develop publish ad deliveri highdefinit game futur vital bluray capac function interact need kind project plan soni recent announc would use technolog next gener playstat mr doherti say gamer raven highqual graphic technolog next gener titl gamer especi work pc alway focus capac deliv textur deeper level deliv higherresolut playback ad focu game move forward increas immers game compani realli like focu creat world involv creat complic d model textur increas resolut increas frame rate part get immers experi fit model current dvd technolog mean compress graphic much much qualiti lose game move photor capabl current technolog limit thrill advanc capac start build immers environ say mr doherti current graphicsintens pc game also requir multipl disc instal highdefinit dvd cut need likewis consol reli singl disc dvd hold six time data mean much well highresolut game bluray alreadi back major hollywood studio mgm studio disney buena vista well top technolog firm like dell lg samsung phillip amongst other toshiba hddvd technolog back paramount univers warner bro real world benefit hddvd appar obviou say jim cardwel presid warner home video mr cardwel ad rapid time market depend signific factor choos go hddvd format court microsoft format choic next gener xbox discus still ongo next gener dvd also abl store imag data ce large consum electron show world run januari
88,343,web photo storage market hots up an increasing number of firms are offering web storage for people with digital photo collections.  digital cameras were the hot gadget of christmas 2004 and worldwide sales of the cameras totalled $24bn last year. many people s hard drives are bulging with photos and services which allow them to store and share their pictures online are becoming popular. search firms such as google are also offering more complex tools for managing personal photo libraries. photo giants such as kodak offer website storage which manages photo collections  lets users edit pictures online and provides print-ordering services. some services  such as kodak s ofoto and snapfish  offer unlimited storage space but they do require users to buy some prints online. other sites  such as pixagogo  charge a monthly fee. marcus hawkins  editor of digital camera magazine  said:  as file sizes of pictures increase  storage becomes a problem.  people are using their hard drives  backing up on cd and dvd and now they are using online storage solutions.   they are a place to store pictures  to share their pictures with families and friends and they can print out their photos.   while many of the services are aimed at the amateur and casual digital photographer  other websites are geared up for enthusiasts who want to share tips and information. photosig is an online community of photographers who can critique each other s work. on tuesday  google released free software for organising and finding digital photos stored on a computer s hard drive. the tool  called picasa  automatically detects photos as they are added to a pc - whether sent via e-mail or transferred from a digital camera.  the software includes tools for restoring colour and removing red eye  as well as sharpening images. photos can then be uploaded to sites such as ofoto. many people use the sites to edit and improve their favourite photographs before ordering prints. mr hawkins added:  the growth area is that you can order your prints online. friends and family can also access pictures you want them to see and they can print them out too.  rather than just a place to dump your pictures  it s about sharing them.   the vast majority of pictures remain on a pc s hard drive  which is why search tools  such as those offered by google  become increasingly important. but some historians and archivists are concerned that the need for perfect pictures will mean that those poor quality prints which offered a tantilising glimpse of the past may disappear forever.  it s one thing taking pictures  it s another finding them   said mr hawkins.  but this is the same problem that has always existed - how many of us have photos in wallets tucked away somewhere,web photo storag market hot increas number firm offer web storag peopl digit photo collect digit camera hot gadget christma worldwid sale camera total bn last year mani peopl hard drive bulg photo servic allow store share pictur onlin becom popular search firm googl also offer complex tool manag person photo librari photo giant kodak offer websit storag manag photo collect let user edit pictur onlin provid printord servic servic kodak ofoto snapfish offer unlimit storag space requir user buy print onlin site pixagogo charg monthli fee marcu hawkin editor digit camera magazin say file size pictur increas storag becom problem peopl use hard drive back cd dvd use onlin storag solut place store pictur share pictur famili friend print photo mani servic aim amateur casual digit photograph websit gear enthusiast want share tip inform photosig onlin commun photograph critiqu work tuesday googl releas free softwar organis find digit photo store comput hard drive tool call picasa automat detect photo ad pc whether sent via email transfer digit camera softwar includ tool restor colour remov red eye well sharpen imag photo upload site ofoto mani peopl use site edit improv favourit photograph order print mr hawkin ad growth area order print onlin friend famili also access pictur want see print rather place dump pictur share vast major pictur remain pc hard drive search tool offer googl becom increasingli import historian archivist concern need perfect pictur mean poor qualiti print offer tantilis glimps past may disappear forev one thing take pictur anoth find say mr hawkin problem alway exist mani u photo wallet tuck away somewher
89,764,shares rise on new man utd offer shares in manchester united closed up 4.75% on monday following a new offer from us tycoon malcolm glazer.  the board of the football club is expected to meet early this week to discuss the latest proposal  which values the club at £800m ($1.5bn). manchester united revealed on sunday that it had received a detailed proposal from mr glazer  which looks set to receive more serious scrutiny. the club has previously rejected mr glazer s approaches out of hand. but a senior source at the club told the bbc:  this time it s different.  supporters  group shareholders united  however  urged the club to reject the new deal.  a spokesman for the shareholders united said:  i can t see any difference (compared to mr glazer s previous proposals) other than £200m less debt.  he isn t bringing any money into the club; he ll use our money to buy it.   mr glazer s latest move is being led by mr glazer s two sons  avi and joel  according to the financial times. a proposal was received by david gill  united s chief executive  at the end of last week  pitched at about 300p a share. david cummings  head of uk equities for standard life investments  said he believed a  well funded  300p a share bid would be enough for mr glazer to take control of the club.   i do not think there is anything that manchester united fans can do about it   he told the bbc.  they can complain about it but it is curtains for them. they may not want him but they are going to get him.  the us tycoon  who has been wooing the club for the last 12 months  has approached the united board with  detailed proposals   it has confirmed.  mr glazer  who owns the tampa bay buccaneers team  hopes this will lead to a formal bid being accepted. he is believed to have increased the amount of equity in the new proposal  though it is not clear by how much. for his proposal to succeed  he needs the support of united s largest shareholders  the irish horseracing tycoons jp mcmanus and john magnier. they own 29% of united through their cubic expression investment vehicle. mr glazer and his family hold a stake of 28.1%. but it is not yet known whether mr mcmanus and mr magnier would support a glazer bid. nm rothschild  the investment bank  is advising mr glazer  according to the financial times. his previous adviser  jpmorgan  quit last year when mr glazer went ahead and voted against the appointment of three united directors to the board  against its advice. but the ft said it thought jp morgan may still have had some role in financing mr glazer s latest financial proposal.,share rise new man utd offer share manchest unit close monday follow new offer u tycoon malcolm glazer board footbal club expect meet earli week discus late propos valu club £m bn manchest unit reveal sunday receiv detail propos mr glazer look set receiv seriou scrutini club previous reject mr glazer approach hand senior sourc club told bbc time differ support group sharehold unit howev urg club reject new deal spokesman sharehold unit say see differ compar mr glazer previou propos £m less debt bring money club use money buy mr glazer late move lead mr glazer two son avi joel accord financi time propos receiv david gill unit chief execut end last week pitch p share david cum head uk equiti standard life invest say believ well fund p share bid would enough mr glazer take control club think anyth manchest unit fan told bbc complain curtain may want go get u tycoon woo club last month approach unit board detail propos confirm mr glazer own tampa bay buccan team hope lead formal bid accept believ increas amount equiti new propos though clear much propos succeed need support unit large sharehold irish horserac tycoon jp mcmanu john magnier unit cubic express invest vehicl mr glazer famili hold stake yet know whether mr mcmanu mr magnier would support glazer bid nm rothschild invest bank advis mr glazer accord financi time previou advis jpmorgan quit last year mr glazer go ahead vote appoint three unit director board advic ft say thought jp morgan may still role financ mr glazer late financi propos
90,1555,gadget market  to grow in 2005  the explosion in consumer technology is to continue into 2005  delegates at the world s largest gadget show  in las vegas  have been told.  the number of gadgets in the shops is predicted to grow by 11%  while devices which talk to each other will become increasingly important.  everything is going digital   kirsten pfeifer from the consumer electronics association  told the bbc news website. the consumer electronics show (ces) featured the pick of 2005 s products.  consumers are controlling what they want and technologies like hdtvs [high-definition tvs]  digital radio  and digital cameras will remain strong in 2005.  all the products on show really showed the breadth and depth of the industry.  despite showing diversity  some delegates attending complained that the showcase lacked as much  wow factor  as in previous years.  the portable technologies on show also reflected one of the buzzwords of ces  which was the  time and place shifting  of multimedia content - being able to watch and listen to video and music anywhere  at any time. at the start of last year s ces  the cea predicted there would be an average growth of 4% in 2004. that figure was surpassed with the rise in popularity of portable digital music players  personal video recorders and digital cameras. it was clear also that gadgets are becoming a lot more about lifestyle choice  with fashion and personalisation becoming increasingly key to the way gadgets are designed. part of this has been the rise in spending power of the  generation x-ers  who have grown up with technology and who now have the spending power and desire for more devices that suit them. more than 57% of the consumer electronics market is made up of female buyers  according to cea research. hybrid devices  which combine a number of multimedia functions  were also in evidence on the show floor.  a lot of this is driven by just the ability to do it   said stephen baker  a consumer electronics analyst with retail research firm npd group.  some of these functions cost next to nothing to add.   as well as the show floor showcasing everything from tiny wearable mp3 players to giant high-definition tvs  several keynote speeches were made by industry leaders  such as microsoft chief bill gates. despite several embarrassing technical glitches during mr gate s pre-show speech  he announced several new partnerships - mainly for the us market. he unveiled new ways of letting people take tv shows recorded on personal video recorders and watch them back on portable devices. he disappointed some  however  by failing to announce any details of the next generation of the xbox games console. another disappointment was the lack of exposure sony s new portable games device  the psp  had at the show. sony said the much-anticipated gadget would most likely start shipping in march for the us and europe. it went on sale in japan before christmas. there were only two psps embedded in glass cabinets at the show though and no representatives to discuss further details. a sony representative told the bbc news website this was because sony did not consider it to be part of their  consumer technology  offering.  elsewhere at the show  there was a plethora of colour and plasma screens  including samsung s 102-inch (2.6 metre) plasma - the largest in the world. industry experts were also excited about high-definition technologies coming to the fore in 2005  with new formats for dvds coming out which will hold six times as much data as conventional dvds. with so many devices on the move there were a lot of products on show offering external storage  like seagate s 5gb pocket sized external hard drive  which won an innovation for engineering and design prize. more than 120 000 trade professionals attended ces in las vegas  which officially ran from 6 to 9 january.,gadget market grow explos consum technolog continu deleg world large gadget show la vega told number gadget shop predict grow devic talk becom increasingli import everyth go digit kirsten pfeifer consum electron associ told bbc news websit consum electron show ce featur pick product consum control want technolog like hdtv highdefinit tv digit radio digit camera remain strong product show realli show breadth depth industri despit show diver deleg attend complain showcas lack much wow factor previou year portabl technolog show also reflect one buzzword ce time place shift multimedia content abl watch listen video music anywher time start last year ce cea predict would averag growth figur surpass rise popular portabl digit music player person video record digit camera clear also gadget becom lot lifestyl choic fashion personalis becom increasingli key way gadget design part rise spend power gener xer grown technolog spend power desir devic suit consum electron market make femal buyer accord cea research hybrid devic combin number multimedia function also evid show floor lot driven abil say stephen baker consum electron analyst retail research firm npd group function cost next noth add well show floor showcas everyth tini wearabl mp player giant highdefinit tv sever keynot speech make industri leader microsoft chief bill gate despit sever embarrass technic glitch mr gate preshow speech announc sever new partnership mainli u market unveil new way let peopl take tv show record person video record watch back portabl devic disappoint howev fail announc detail next gener xbox game consol anoth disappoint lack exposur soni new portabl game devic psp show soni say muchanticip gadget would like start ship march u europ go sale japan christma two psp embed glass cabinet show though repres discus detail soni repres told bbc news websit soni consid part consum technolog offer elsewher show plethora colour plasma screen includ samsung inch metr plasma large world industri expert also excit highdefinit technolog come fore new format dvd come hold six time much data convent dvd mani devic move lot product show offer extern storag like seagat gb pocket size extern hard drive innov engin design prize trade profession attend ce la vega offici ran januari

94,249,boeing unveils new 777 aircraft us aircraft firm boeing has unveiled its new long-distance 777 plane  as it tries to regain its position as the industry s leading manufacturer.  the 777-200lr will be capable of flying almost 11 000 miles non-stop  linking cities such as london and sydney. boeing  in contrast to european rival airbus  hopes airlines will want to fly smaller aircraft over longer distances. airbus  which overtook boeing as the number one civilian planemaker in 2003  is focusing on so-called super jumbos.  analysts are divided over which approach is best and say that this latest tussle between boeing and airbus may prove to be a defining moment for the airline industry. boeing plans to offer twin-engine planes that are able to fly direct to many of the world s airports  getting rid of the need for connecting flights.  it is banking on smaller  slimmer planes such as the 777-200lr and its much-anticipated 787 dreamliner plane  which is set to take to the skies in 2008. the 777-200lr  which had its launch delayed by the 11 september attacks in the us  is the fifth variation of boeing s twin-aisle 777 plane. the company offically  rolled-out  the new 777 in seattle at 2200 gmt. better fuel efficiency from engines made by ge and lighter materials mean that the plane can connect almost any two cities worldwide.   boeing has the latest variant in a very successful line of airplanes and there is no doubt it will continue to be very successful   said david learmount  operations and safety editor at industry magazine flight international. but the 777-200lr  is a niche player   mr learmount continued  adding that reach was not the only criteria airlines used when picking their aircraft. mr learmount pointed out that the 777-200lr has been on the market for a couple of years and only had limited success at attracting orders. he also said that while the plane may be able to fly to sydney from london in one hit  prevailing winds meant that it would have to stop somewhere on the return journey.  for airbus  the future is big - it is pinning its hopes on planes that can carry as many as 840 people between large hub airports. from there  passengers would be ferried to their final destinations by smaller planes. airbus is also keeping its options open and plans to compete in all the main categories of aircraft. it has been producing a rival to boeing s 777 line for more than a year.  airbus is now where boeing was a few years ago  with its product range  said flight international s mr learmount.  both boeing and airbus have been taking orders for their new planes. boeing said it expected to sell about 500 of its 777-200lr planes over the next 20 years. it already has orders from pakistan international airlines and eva of taiwan. these orders should help underpin the company s profits. boeing said earnings during the last three months of 2004 dropped by 84% because of costs relating to stopping production of its smallest airliner  the 717  and the cancellation of a us air force 767 tanker contract. net profit was $186m (£98m; 143m euros) in the quarter  compared with $1.13bn in the same period in 2003.,boe unveil new aircraft u aircraft firm boe unveil new longdist plane tri regain posit industri lead manufactur lr capabl fli almost mile nonstop link citi london sydney boe contrast european rival airbu hope airlin want fli small aircraft longer distanc airbu overtook boe number one civilian planemak focus socal super jumbo analyst divid approach best say late tussl boe airbu may prove defin moment airlin industri boe plan offer twinengin plane abl fli direct mani world airport get rid need connect flight bank small slimmer plane lr muchanticip dreamlin plane set take sky lr launch delay septemb attack u fifth variat boe twinaisl plane compani offic rolledout new seattl gmt well fuel effici engin make ge lighter materi mean plane connect almost two citi worldwid boe late variant success line airplan doubt continu success say david learmount oper safeti editor industri magazin flight intern lr nich player mr learmount continu ad reach criterion airlin use pick aircraft mr learmount point lr market coupl year limit success attract order also say plane may abl fli sydney london one hit prevail wind meant would stop somewher return journey airbu futur big pin hope plane carri mani peopl larg hub airport passeng would ferri final destin small plane airbu also keep option open plan compet main categori aircraft produc rival boe line year airbu boe year ago product rang say flight intern mr learmount boe airbu take order new plane boe say expect sell lr plane next year alreadi order pakistan intern airlin eva taiwan order help underpin compani profit boe say earn last three month drop cost relat stop product small airlin cancel u air forc tanker contract net profit m £m m euro quarter compar bn period
95,1112,eu referendum question unveiled the question to be asked in the referendum on the eu constitution has been unveiled by the government.  it will be:  should the united kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the european union   the constitution will be incorporated into uk law if there is a yes vote in the referendum  expected in 2006. critics say the constitution is a further step towards a federal europe  but advocates say it ensures effective operation of the enlarged 25-state eu.  if we reject this treaty  britain will be isolated and weak in europe   said foreign secretary jack straw  who along with the rest of the cabinet  will back a  yes  vote.  patriots by definition wanted the uk to be prosperous at home and strong and influential abroad  mr straw said.  our role as a leading member of the eu is a crucial part of securing that.   conservative shadow foreign secretary michael ancram said the referendum question  seems straightforward . but he accused the government of trying to confuse the issue by putting the eu referendum question in the same bill as the ratification of the constitution  when they should be treated as  two separate issues . despite this  underhand trick   the referendum bill stood  no chance of becoming law before the election   he added.  this is tony blair s cheap gesture to the pro-constitution lobby while he runs scared of a debate on europe he knows he cannot win.  neil o brien  director of anti-constitution group vote no  said:  the reality is that the government doesn t want to discuss the eu constitution ahead of the election because they know it is extremely unpopular with voters and with business.   the uk independence party said:  if the government believes that a no vote would mean that we should leave the european union  they should just ask us if we want to leave the eu. then we can be out of it and better off much sooner.   liberal democrat leader charles kennedy  who backs the constitution  said he expected the referendum would come in the first half of next year. he told bbc radio 4 s today programme:  the sooner we get on with this  the better.  he said the question sounded  very neutral  and  balanced   adding it would enable the argument  to be enjoined fairly and squarely on both sides . green mep caroline lucas welcomed tony blair s  courage in keeping his word  on holding a referendum. but she added:  this treaty is a flawed document that will make the eu less accountable  less sustainable  and less just.   mr blair signed the constitution at a ceremony in rome in november  but had already made it clear the issue would be put to voters in a referendum. that promise came after sustained pressure from opposition parties. jack straw  who argues the constitution reflected a  british vision for europe  and gives  national governments a stronger grip   has said the referendum could be held in spring 2006. but in an interview with the financial times  mr blair refused to be pinned down to that date  saying britain would hold a poll  some time in 2006 but when  i don t know . the paper said the prime minister  claimed ignorance  of when other countries were planning to hold their referendums.,eu referendum question unveil question ask referendum eu constitut unveil govern unit kingdom approv treati establish constitut european union

97,1838,watchdog probes e-mail deletions the information commissioner says he is urgently asking for details of cabinet office orders telling staff to delete e-mails more than three months old.  richard thomas  totally condemned  the deletion of e-mails to prevent their disclosure under freedom of information laws coming into force on 1 january. government guidance said e-mails should only be deleted if they served  no current purpose   mr thomas said. the tories and the lib dems have questioned the timing of the new rules.  tory leader michael howard has written to tony blair demanding an explanation of the new rules on e-mail retention. on monday lib dem constitutional affairs committee chairman alan beith warned that the deletion of millions of government e-mails could harm the ability of key probes like the hutton inquiry. the timing of the new rules just before the freedom of information act comes into forces was  too unlikely to have been a coincidence   mr beith said. but a cabinet office spokeswoman said the move was not about the new laws or  the destruction of important records . mr beith urged the information commissioner to look at how the  e-mail regime  could  support the freedom of information regime .  mr thomas said:  the new act of parliament makes it very clear that to destroy records in order to prevent their disclosure becomes a criminal offence.  he said there was already clear guidance on the retention of e-mails contained in a code of practice from the lord chancellor. all e-mails are subject to the freedom of information laws  but the important thing was the content of the e-mail  said mr thomas.   if in doubt retain  that has been the long-standing principle of the civil service and public authorities. it s only when you ve got no further use for the particular record that it may be legitimate to destroy it.  but any deliberate destruction to avoid the possibility of later disclosure is to be totally condemned.  the freedom of information act will cover england  wales and northern ireland from next year. similar measures are being brought in at the same time in scotland. it provides the public with a right of access to information held by about 100 000 public bodies  subject to various exemptions. its implementation will be monitored by the information commissioner.,watchdog probe email delet inform commission say urgent ask detail cabinet offic order tell staff delet email three month old richard thoma total condemn delet email prevent disclosur freedom inform law come forc januari govern guidanc say email delet serv current purpos mr thoma say torus lib dem question time new rule torus leader michael howard write toni blair demand explan new rule email retent monday lib dem constitut affair committe chairman alan beith warn delet million govern email could harm abil key probe like hutton inquiri time new rule freedom inform act come forc unlik coincid mr beith say cabinet offic spokeswoman say move new law destruct import record mr beith urg inform commission look email regim could support freedom inform regim mr thoma say new act parliament make clear destroy record order prevent disclosur becom crimin offenc say alreadi clear guidanc retent email contain code practic lord chancellor email subject freedom inform law import thing content email say mr thoma doubt retain longstand principl civil servic public author get use particular record may legitim destroy deliber destruct avoid possibl later disclosur total condemn freedom inform act cover england wale northern ireland next year similar measur brought time scotland provid public right access inform held public bodi subject variou exempt implement monitor inform commission

100,2175,lifestyle  governs mobile choice  faster  better or funkier hardware alone is not going to help phone firms sell more handsets  research suggests.  instead  phone firms keen to get more out of their customers should not just be pushing the technology for its own sake. consumers are far more interested in how handsets fit in with their lifestyle than they are in screen size  onboard memory or the chip inside  shows an in-depth study by telecommunications company ericsson.  historically in the industry there has been too much focus on using technology   said dr michael bjorn  senior advisor on mobile media at ericsson s consumer and enterprise lab.  we have to stop saying that these technologies will change their lives   he said.  we should try to speak to consumers in their own language and help them see how it fits in with what they are doing   he told the bbc news website.  for the study  ericsson interviewed 14 000 mobile phone owners on the ways they use their phone.  people s habits remain the same   said dr bjorn.  they just move the activity into the mobile phone as it s a much more convenient way to do it.   one good example of this was diary-writing among younger people  he said. while diaries have always been popular  a mobile phone -- especially one equipped with a camera -- helps them keep it in a different form. youngsters  use of text messages also reflects their desire to chat and keep in contact with friends and again just lets them do it in a slightly changed way. dr bjorn said that although consumers do what they always did but use a phone to do it  the sheer variety of what the new handset technologies make possible does gradually drive new habits and lifestyles. ericsson s research has shown that consumers divide into different  tribes  that use phones in different ways. dr bjorn said groups dubbed  pioneers  and  materialists  were most interested in trying new things and were behind the start of many trends in phone use.  for instance   he said   older people are using sms much more than they did five years ago.  this was because younger users  often the children of ageing mobile owners  encouraged older people to try it so they could keep in touch.  another factor governing the speed of change in mobile phone use was the simple speed with which new devices are bought by pioneers and materialists. only when about 25% of people have handsets with new innovations on them  such as cameras  can consumers stop worrying that if they send a picture message the person at the other end will be able to see it.  once this significant number of users is passed  use of new innovations tends to take off. dr bjorn said that early reports of camera phone usage in japan seemed to imply that the innovation was going to be a flop. however  he said  now 45% of the japanese people ericsson questioned use their camera phone at least once a month. in 2003 the figure was 29%. similarly  across europe the numbers of people taking snaps with cameras is starting to rise. in 2003 only 4% of the people in the uk took a phonecam snap at least once a month. now the figure is 14%. similar rises have been seen in many other european nations. dr bjorn said that people also used their camera phones in very different ways to film and even digital cameras.  usage patterns for digital cameras are almost exactly replacing usage patterns for analogue cameras   he said. digital cameras tend to be used on significant events such as weddings  holidays and birthdays. by contrast  he said  camera phones were being used much more to capture a moment and were being woven into everyday life.,lifestyl govern mobil choic faster well funkier hardwar alon go help phone firm sell handset research suggest instead phone

105,844,france starts digital terrestrial france has become the last big european country to launch a digital terrestrial tv (dtt) service.  initially  more than a third of the population will be able to receive 14 free-to-air channels. despite the long wait for a french dtt roll-out  the new platform s backers hope to emulate the success of its uk free-to-air counterpart  freeview. recent figures from the uk s regulator ofcom showed freeview was more popular than the sky digital satellite service. in the three months to september 2004  almost five times as many people signed up to the uk s free-to-air dtt service compared with sky. almost 60% of uk households have gone digital on at least one television set through cable  satellite or freeview.  the french dtt platform is known as tnt  which stands for tv numerique terrestre or digital terrestrial television. but it is being branded as television numerique pour tous  or  digital television for all . tnt is a joint venture between public broadcaster france televisions and a handful of cable and satellite operators. digital terrestrial tv will launch as a free-to-air platform to start with  adding pay-tv channels later. thirty-five contenders have bid for an additional eight frequencies on top of the 14 already allocated.  a couple of years ago  dtt had a bad image   said olivier gerolami  chief operating officer of tnt.   but everyone s impressed with dtt in the uk  italy and germany  and they realise it is a very good idea.  france is the poorest market in europe in terms of free-to-air national channels  so it has the potential to be one of the biggest dtt markets   mr gerolami added in remarks quoted by the us entertainment industry paper variety. tnt aims to reach 35% of france s population at launch  from 17 transmission sites. the transmission area will initially include paris  lille  lyon and toulouse. eventually there will be 115 sites reaching over 80% of homes. digital terrestrial set-top boxes are available from as little as 70 euros (£50). a recent survey by mediametrie found that 70% of people interviewed were aware of dtt  and 25% were planning to buy a digital receiver. consumer electronics companies such as nokia  sagem  sony and thomson are gearing up for production. the conseil superieur de l audiovisuel (csa)  the french broadcasting regulator  said:  following the recent success of freeview in the uk  some manufacturers are optimistic about sales prospects . media analysts believe that initially the majority of viewers will buy inexpensive set-top boxes that are unable to support interactive services. the csa said the current aim of reaching 85% of the population by 2007 was achievable  but the future of the remaining tv viewers required action by the public sector. for the most part  they are people living in mountainous or border areas  which will remain beyond the reach of digital terrestrial tv for years.  up to 15 pay-tv channels will launch on dtt between september 2005 and march 2006. leading pay-tv operators canal plus and tps have submitted bids to market bouquets of channels. free-to-air services will be broadcast in mpeg-2 format. but pay-tv operators will be allowed to broadcast in mpeg-4 - a much better compression technology - which will potentially allow for high-definition (hd) subscription services in the future. tnt expects between 700 000 and one million dtt set-top boxes to be sold in 2005.  it is difficult to tell how quickly it will take off   said mr gerolami   but we re optimistic that it will revolutionise television in france.  other analysts were less optimistic  predicting consumers would now be less likely to sign up for pay-tv subscriptions.  we think free dtt could put brakes on the underlying growth of pay-tv in france   said henri de bodinat  vice-president of the arthur d. little consultancy.,franc start digit terrestri franc becom last big european countri launch digit terrestri tv dtt servic initi third popul abl receiv freetoair channel despit long wait french dtt rollout new platform backer hope emul success uk freetoair counterpart freeview recent figur uk regul ofcom show freeview popular sky digit satellit servic three month septemb almost five time mani peopl sign uk freetoair dtt servic compar sky almost uk household go digit least one televis set cabl satellit freeview french dtt platform know tnt stand tv numeriqu terrestr digit terrestri televis brand televis numeriqu pour tou digit televis tnt joint ventur public broadcast franc televis hand cabl satellit oper digit terrestri tv launch freetoair platform start ad paytv channel later thirtyf contend bid addit eight frequenc top alreadi alloc coupl year ago dtt bad imag say olivi gerolami chief oper offic tnt everyon impress dtt uk itali germani realis good idea franc poorest market europ term freetoair nation channel potenti one big dtt market mr gerolami ad remark quot u entertain industri paper varieti tnt aim reach franc popul launch transmiss site transmiss area initi includ pari lill lyon toulous eventu site reach home digit terrestri settop box avail littl euro £ recent survey mediametri found peopl interview awar dtt plan buy digit receiv consum electron compani nokia sagem soni thomson gear product conseil superieur de l audiovisuel csa french broadcast regul say follow recent success freeview uk manufactur optimist sale prospect medium analyst believ initi major viewer buy inexpens settop box unabl support interact servic csa say current aim reach popul achiev futur remain tv viewer requir action public sector part peopl live mountain border area remain beyond reach digit terrestri tv year paytv channel launch dtt septemb march lead paytv oper canal plu tp submit bid market bouquet channel freetoair servic broadcast mpeg format paytv oper allow broadcast mpeg much well compress technolog potenti allow highdefinit hd subscript servic futur tnt expect one million dtt settop box sell difficult tell quickli take say mr gerolami optimist revolutionis televis franc analyst less optimist predict consum would less like sign paytv subscript think free dtt could put brake underli growth paytv franc say henri de bodinat vicepresid arthur littl consult
106,2173,middlesbrough 2-2 charlton a late header by teenager danny graham earned middlesbrough a battling draw with charlton at the riverside.  matt holland had put the visitors ahead in the 14th minute after his shot took a deflection off franck queudrue. but middlesbrough peppered the charlton goal after the break and chris riggott stroked home the equaliser. shaun bartlett s strike put charlton back in front but that lead lasted just six minutes before graham rushed onto queudrue s pass to head home. the match burst to life from the whistle and charlton defender hermann hreidarsson had sight of an open goal after just six minutes. hreidarsson received danny murphy s free-kick from the right but he crashed his free header wide of the far post. the iceland international looked such a danger the boro bench could be heard issuing frantic instructions to mark him.  charlton s early pressure paid off when bartlett received a long ball from talal el karkouri in the box and laid it off to holland who buried his right-footed strike. szilard nemeth  recalled in place of joseph-desire job  was twice denied his chance to get middlesbrough back on level terms by dean kiely. the striker played a great one-two with jimmy floyd hasselbaink only to see kiely get down well to smother his shot before directing a header straight into the keeper s arms. boro had plenty of time on the ball but the addicks comfortably mopped up the pressure - with kiely tipping a hasselbaink header over the bar - to take their lead into half-time.  it was all one-way traffic after the break at the riverside as middlesbrough poured forward and kiely even saved hreidarsson s blushes when he palmed the ball away to prevent a charlton own goal. but the addicks keeper could do nothing about riggott s equaliser in the 74th minute. the boro defender looked suspiciously offside as he got on the end of gareth southgate s misdirected effort  but despite the charlton protests his goal stood. the addicks did not let their heads drop and bartlett left the boro defence standing  picking up hreidarsson s cross to easily sink his right-footed strike. but substitute graham was on hand to grab a share of the points for the home side. the 19-year-old striker nodding home the equaliser - and his first premiership goal - with five minutes left on the clock.   i felt we did enough to win the game even though the first half was lacklustre.  we dominated after the break  the players showed a fantastic response and we should have gone on to win.  but for (charlton goalkeeper) dean kiely  who made three tremendous saves  we could have scored five or six.    to take the lead and then to get penned back  it feels a little bit like a defeat   admitted kiely.  we were winning but middlesbrough kept knocking on the door. but we stood up and credit to us we didn t capitulate.  we ll kick on now. our short-term ambition is to progress from the seventh place finish from last year.   nash  reiziger (graham 82)  riggott  southgate  queudrue  parlour (job 86)  doriva  nemeth (parnaby 87)  zenden  downing  hasselbaink.  subs not used: cooper  knight.  riggott 74  graham 86.  kiely  hreidarsson  perry  el karkouri  young  konchesky  murphy (euell 78)  holland  kishishev  thomas (johansson 72)  bartlett.  subs not used: fish  jeffers  andersen.  konchesky  hreidarsson  perry.  holland 14  bartlett 80.  29 603  m riley (w yorkshire).,middlesbrough charlton late header teenag danni graham earn middlesbrough battl draw charlton riversid matt holland put visitor ahead th minut shot take deflect franck queudru middlesbrough pepper charlton goal break chri riggott stroke home equalis shaun bartlett strike put charlton back front lead last six minut graham rush onto queudru pas head home match burst life whistl charlton defend hermann hreidarsson sight open goal six minut hreidarsson receiv danni murphi freekick right crash free header wide far post iceland intern look danger boro bench could heard issu frantic instruct mark charlton earli pressur paid bartlett receiv long ball talal el karkouri box laid holland buri rightfoot strike szilard nemeth recal place josephdesir job twice deni chanc get middlesbrough back level term dean kieli striker play great onetwo jimmi floyd hasselbaink see kieli get well smother shot direct header straight keeper arm boro plenti time ball addick comfort mop pressur kieli tip hasselbaink header bar take lead halftim oneway traffic break riversid middlesbrough pour forward kieli even save hreidarsson blush palm ball away prevent charlton goal addick keeper could noth riggott equalis th minut boro defend look suspici offsid get end gareth southgat misdirect effort despit charlton protest goal stood addick let head drop bartlett left boro defenc stand pick hreidarsson cross easili sink rightfoot strike substitut graham hand grab share point home side yearold striker nod home equalis first premiership goal five minut left clock felt enough win game even though first half lacklustr domin break player show fantast respons go win charlton goalkeep dean kieli make three tremend save could score five six take lead get pen back feel littl bit like defeat admit kieli win middlesbrough kept knock door stood credit u capitul kick shortterm ambit progress seventh place finish last year nash reizig graham riggott southgat queudru parlour job doriva nemeth parnabi zenden down hasselbaink sub use cooper knight riggott graham kieli hreidarsson perri el karkouri young koncheski murphi euell holland kishishev thoma johansson bartlett sub use fish jeffer andersen koncheski hreidarsson perri holland bartlett riley w yorkshir

116,1164,bt program to beat dialler scams bt is introducing two initiatives to help beat rogue dialler scams  which can cost dial-up net users thousands.  from may  dial-up net users will be able to download free software to stop computers using numbers not on a user s  pre-approved list . inadvertently downloaded by surfers  rogue diallers are programs which hijack modems and dial up a premium rate number when users log on. thousands of uk dial-up users are believed to have been hit by the scam. some people have faced phone bills of up to £2 000. bt s modem protection program will check numbers that are dialled by a computer and will block them if they have not been pre-approved  such as national and net service provider numbers. icstis  the uk s premium rate services watchdog  said it had been looking for companies to take the lead in initiatives.  the initiatives are very welcome   a spokesperson from icstis told the bbc news website.  we are very pleased to see they are putting into place new measures to protect consumers.   the second initiative bt announced is an early warning system which will alert bt customers if there is unusual activity on their phone bills. if a bill rises substantially above its usual daily average  or if a call is made to a suspect number  a text or voice alert will be sent to the user s landline phone. as part of the clamp-down on rogue diallers  companies must now satisfy stringent conditions  including clear terms and conditions  information about how to delete diallers and responsibility for customer refunds. any firm running a dialler without permission can now be closed down by icstis. the watchdog brought in the action last october following a decision to license all companies which wanted to operate legitimate premium rate dialler services.  there are legitimate companies who offer services such as adult content  sports results and music downloads by charging a premium rate rather than by credit card bt said it had ploughed an enormous amount of effort into protecting people from the problem. it has already barred more than 1 000 premium rate numbers and has tried to raise public awareness about the scams.  we now want to ensure there are even stronger safeguards for our customers  who we would urge to make use of these new options to protect themselves   said gavin patterson  group managing director for consumer the arm of bt. both schemes have been undergoing trials in ireland  and will be made available to 20 million bt customers from may.,bt program beat dialler scam bt introduc two initi help beat rogu dialler scam cost dialup net user thousand may dialup net user abl download free softwar stop comput use number user preapprov list inadvert download surfer rogu dialler program hijack modem dial premium rate number user log thousand uk dialup user believ hit scam peopl face phone bill £ bt modem protect program check number diall comput block preapprov nation net servic provid number icsti uk premium rate servic watchdog say look compani take lead initi initi welcom spokesperson icsti told bbc news websit plea see put place new measur protect consum second initi bt announc earli warn system alert bt custom unusu activ phone bill bill rise substanti usual daili averag call make suspect number text voic alert sent user landlin phone part clampdown rogu dialler compani must satisfi stringent condit includ clear term condit inform delet dialler respons custom refund firm run dialler without permiss close icsti watchdog brought action last octob follow decis licens compani want oper legitim premium rate dialler servic legitim compani offer servic adult content sport result music download charg premium rate rather credit card bt say plough enorm amount effort protect peopl problem alreadi bar premium rate number tri rais public awar scam want ensur even strong safeguard custom would urg make use new option protect say gavin patterson group manag director consum arm bt scheme undergo trial ireland make avail million bt custom may
117,1057,wenger steps up row arsene wenger has stepped up his feud with sir alex ferguson by claiming the manchester united manager is guilty of bringing football into disrepute.  the pair s long-running row was put back in the headlines on saturday when ferguson said his arsenal counterpart was  a disgrace . wenger initially refused to bite back  saying only:  i will never answer any questions any more about this man.  but now he claims ferguson should be punished by the football association. the latest twist in the ferguson-wenger saga came on saturday when the united boss  in an interview with the independent newspaper  discussed the events after the game between the two sides in october. united won 2-0 that day  at old trafford  but the game was followed by a now notorious food fight which saw ferguson s clothes covered in soup and pizza. the sides meet again at highbury on 1 february.  in the tunnel wenger was criticising my players  calling them cheats  so i told him to leave them alone and behave himself   ferguson said on saturday.  he ran at me with hands raised saying  what do you want to do about it    to not apologise for the behaviour of the players to another manager is unthinkable. it s a disgrace  but i don t expect wenger to ever apologise  he s that type of person.   those allegations were put to wenger after saturday s game at bolton  which arsenal lost to slip 10 points behind chelsea in the title race. at first he said only:  i ve always been consistent with that story and told you nothing happened.  if he has to talk  he talks. if he wants to make a newspaper article  he makes a newspaper article.  he doesn t interest me and doesn t matter to me at all. i will never answer to any provocation from him any more.  he does what he likes in england anyway. he can go abroad one day and see how it is.  but later on saturday  according to the independent  wenger spoke to a smaller group of reporters and expanded on his reaction.  i have no diplomatic relations with him   the arsenal boss is quoted as saying.  what i don t understand is that he does what he wants and you (the press) are all at his feet.   the situation (concerning the food fight) has been judged and there is a game going on in a month.  the managers have a responsibility to protect the game before the game. but in england you are only punished for what you say after the game.  now the whole story starts again. i don t go into that game. we play football. i am a football manager and i love football above all ... no matter what people say.  reminded that ferguson called him  a disgrace   wenger added:  i don t respond to anything. in england you have a good phrase. it is  bringing the game into disrepute .  but that is not only after a game  it is as well before a game.   ferguson had also claimed that united chief executive david gill and arsenal vice-chairman david dein had agreed at boardroom level not to discuss the incident in public. but ferguson added:  in the ensuing weeks all you got was a diatribe from arsenal about being kicked off the pitch and all that nonsense. gill phoned dein three times to complain but nothing was done.  the return is on 1 february and they will come out with another diatribe.  david gill and i feel we should set the record straight because arsenal have not written to us to apologise and we would not let that happen here.  meanwhile  the league managers association have offered to act as peacemakers in the hope of resolving the on-going row. during that stormy game in october  united striker ruud van nistelrooy caught arsenal s ashley cole with one particularly strong tackle. wenger later accused van nistelrooy of  cheating  and was fined £15 000 and  severely reprimanded  by the football association. ferguson admitted on saturday that van nistelrooy s tackle  which earned the dutchman a ban   could have given (cole) a serious injury   but he believes arsenal were the main aggressors.   wenger is always complaining the match was not played in the right spirit   he added.  they are the worst losers of all time  they don t know how to lose. maybe it is just manchester united  they don t lose many games to other teams.  we tend to forget the worst disciplinary record of all time was arsenal s up until last season. in fairness it has improved and now they are seen as paragons of virtue.  but to wenger it never happens  it is all some dream or nightmare.,wenger step row arsen wenger step feud sir alex ferguson claim manchest unit manag guilti bring footbal disreput

120,508,gm in crunch talks on fiat future fiat will meet car giant general motors (gm) on tuesday in an attempt to reach agreement over the future of the italian firm s loss-making auto group.  fiat claims that gm is legally obliged to buy the 90% of the car unit it does not already own; gm says the contract  signed in 2000  is no longer valid. press reports have speculated that fiat may be willing to accept a cash payment in return for dropping its claim. both companies want to cut costs as the car industry adjusts to waning demand.  the meeting between fiat boss sergio marchionne and gm s rick wagoner is due to take place at 1330 gmt in zurich  according to the reuters news agency.  mr marchionne is confident of his firm s legal position  saying in an interview with the financial times that gm s argument  has no legs . the agreement in question dates back to gm s decision to buy 20% of fiat s auto division in 2000. at the time  it gave the italian firm the right  via a  put option   to sell the remaining stake to gm. in recent weeks  fiat has reiterated its claims that this  put  is still valid and legally binding. however  gm argues that a fiat share sale made last year  which cut gm s holding to 10%  together with asset sales made by fiat have terminated the agreement.  selling the fiat s car-making unit may not prove so simple  analysts say  especially as it is a company that is so closely linked to italy s industrial heritage. political and public pressure may well push the two firms to reach a compromise.  we are not expecting fiat to exercise its put of the auto business against an unwilling gm at this point   brokerage merrill lynch said in a note to investors  adding that any legal battle would be protracted and damaging to the business.  as far as we are aware  the agnelli family  which indirectly controls at least 30% of fiat  has not given a firm public indication that it wants to sell the auto business.  fiat may be willing to cancel the  put  in exchange for money.,gm crunch talk fiat futur fiat meet car giant gener motor gm tuesday attempt reach agreement futur italian firm lossmak auto group fiat claim gm legal oblig buy car unit alreadi gm say contract sign longer valid press report specul fiat may will accept cash payment return drop claim compani want cut cost car industri adjust wane demand meet fiat bos sergio marchionn gm rick wagon due take place gmt zurich accord reuter news agenc mr marchionn confid firm legal posit say interview financi time gm argument leg agreement question date back gm decis buy fiat auto divis time give italian firm right via put option sell remain stake gm recent week fiat reiter claim put still valid legal bind howev gm argu fiat share sale make last year cut gm hold togeth asset sale make fiat termin agreement sell fiat carmak unit may prove simpl analyst say especi compani close link itali industri heritag polit public pressur may well push two firm reach compromis expect fiat exercis put auto busi unwil gm point brokerag merril lynch say note investor ad legal battl would protract damag busi far awar agnelli famili indirectli control least fiat give firm public indic want sell auto busi fiat may will cancel put exchang money

123,773,redford s vision of sundance despite sporting a corduroy cap pulled low over his face plus a pair of dark glasses  robert redford cuts an unmistakable figure through the star-struck crowds at sundance.  it s a rare downtown appearance for the man who started the annual festival in park city  utah back in the 1980s. now in its twenty-first year  sundance continues to grow. some 45 000 people are estimated to have descended on this small ski town with nothing but movies on the mind. it s an opportunity to meet and make deals. redford wanted sundance to be a platform for independent film-makers  but the commercial success of many showcased films have led to criticism that the festival is becoming too mainstream.  smaller festivals like slamdance and xdance  which take place during the same week in park city  are competing for sundance s limelight. but redford is not worried.  the more the merrier   he says.  the point was to create opportunities for people who may not have them.  once independent film had a place where the work could be seen  suddenly the merchants came. with them the celebrities came  then the paparazzi - and suddenly it began to take on a whole new tone   explains redford.   people started to say we had gone mainstream and hollywood  but actually hollywood came to us because suddenly there was good business in independent film   he adds. international film-makers have always been celebrated here  but 2005 is the first year a dedicated world dramatic and documentary competition is being held.  redford wants the festival to encompass viewpoints he believes the american media fails to reflect  particularly how the us is perceived internationally. he has never hidden the fact that he is a democrat. but he reserves particular disdain for the current republican administration.  it s the ability to maintain the importance of dissent in a democratic system which right now is under threat with the attitude of this administration   he says.  i think many voices are being shut down or accused of being unpatriotic if they want to express another point of view. that s very unhealthy and very dangerous.   if we take that policy into the world  there will be the same victims and the same consequences.  sundance isn t just one big screening. there are discussion panels and q&a sessions with directors tackling controversial topics like america s  culture wars  and the iraq war. while redford wishes the festival to be a forum for dissent  the profile of the audience is fairly monolithic. educated  middle class and predominantly white americans comes sundance  with views from the same end of the political spectrum - anti-war and socially liberal. but redford knows this and started the sundance tv channel in an effort to reach a wider audience.  when you look at the films here  what we are presenting is very much egalitarian. and it s about good films and good story-telling be it african america  asian  women  gay  lesbian.  sooner or later we will do away with those stereotypical labels and people will say  it s just a film by so-and so .,redford vision sundanc despit sport corduroy cap pull low face plu pair dark glass robert redford cut unmistak figur starstruck crowd sundanc rare downtown appear man start annual festiv park citi utah back s twentyfirst year sundanc continu grow peopl estim descend small ski town noth movi mind opportun meet make deal redford want sundanc platform independ filmmak commerci success mani showcas film lead critic festiv becom mainstream small festiv like slamdanc xdanc take place week park citi compet sundanc limelight redford worri merrier say point creat opportun peopl may independ film place work could see suddenli merchant come celebr come paparazzo suddenli begin take whole new tone explain redford peopl start say go mainstream hollywood actual hollywood come u suddenli good busi independ film add intern filmmak alway celebr first year dedic world dramat documentari competit held redford want festiv encompass viewpoint believ american medium fail reflect particularli u perceiv intern never hidden fact democrat reserv particular disdain current republican administr abil maintain import dissent democrat system right threat attitud administr say think mani voic shut accus unpatriot want express anoth point view unhealthi danger take polici world victim consequ sundanc one big screen discus panel qa session director tackl controversi topic like america cultur war iraq war redford wish festiv forum dissent profil audienc fairli monolith educ middl class predominantli white american come sundanc view end polit spectrum antiwar social liber redford know start sundanc tv channel effort reach wider audienc look film present much egalitarian good film good storytel african america asian woman gay lesbian sooner later away stereotyp label peopl say film soand

125,2108,game warnings  must be clearer  violent video games should carry larger warnings so parents can understand what their children are playing  the trade and industry secretary has said.  patricia hewitt is expected to call for the law banning the sale of 18-rated games to children to be enforced better at a games industry meeting on sunday. she is concerned too many children are playing games aimed at adults which include  high levels of violence . parents are expected to spend millions on video games as christmas presents.  violent games have been hit by controversy after the game manhunt was blamed by the parents of 14-year-old stefan pakeerah  who was stabbed to death in leicester in february. his mother  giselle  said her son s killer  warren leblanc  17 - who was jailed for life in september - had mimicked behaviour in the game. police investigating the stefan s murder dismissed its influence and manhunt was not part of its legal case. ahead of sunday s meeting in london  ms hewitt said she was proud of the uk s  vibrant games industry  but was concerned too many children were playing games which should only be sold to adults. roger bennett  head of gaming industry body elspa  said banning violent games would be wrong. he said:  we don t want to go down that route. we have seen that the government is supportive of the industry.  the government is holding a further meeting on friday with industry and retail representatives as well as the british board of film classification to discuss how labelling can be made clearer. ms hewitt said:  adults should be treated as adults and children as children. it is important that retailers respect the classifications and do not sell games with high levels of violence to minors.   equally parents need to know what they might be buying for their children.  video games are different to films or videos  and not all parents have grown up playing games in the way our children do.  we need to look carefully at how we improve content warnings and strengthen sales enforcement.  her call was backed by culture  media and sport secretary tessa jowell who said:  you wouldn t let your child watch the texas chainsaw massacre. you wouldn t let them go to a strip club.  so you shouldn t let them play an 18-rated game. it s the same principle - adults can make their own informed choices  but children can t always and need to be protected.  anyone convicted of selling an 18-rated game to a child can be jailed for six months and fined up to £5 000. rockstar games  the makers of manhunt  has said in the past it markets its games responsibly and only targets its adverts at adults.,game warn must clearer violent video game carri large warn parent understand child play trade industri secretari say patricia hewitt expect call law ban sale rate game child enforc well game industri meet sunday concern mani child play game aim adult includ high level violenc parent expect spend million video game christma present violent game hit controversi game manhunt blame parent yearold stefan pakeerah stab death leicest februari mother gisel say son killer warren leblanc jail life septemb mimick behaviour game polic investig stefan murder dismiss influenc manhunt part legal case ahead sunday meet london m hewitt say proud uk vibrant game industri concern mani child play game sell adult roger bennett head game industri bodi elspa say ban violent game would wrong say want go rout see govern support industri govern hold meet friday industri retail repres well british board film classif discus label make clearer m hewitt say adult treat adult child child import retail respect classif sell game high level violenc minor equal parent need know might buy child video game differ film video parent grown play game way child need look care improv content warn strengthen sale enforc call back cultur medium sport secretari tessa jowel say let child watch texa chainsaw massacr let go strip club let play rate game principl adult make inform choic child alway need protect anyon convict sell rate game child jail six month fine £ rockstar game maker manhunt say past market game respons target advert adult

127,897,troubled marsh under sec scrutiny the us stock market regulator is investigating troubled insurance broker marsh & mclennan s shareholder transactions  the firm has said.  the securities and exchange commission has asked for information about transactions involving holders of 5% or more of the firm s shares. marsh has said it is co-operating fully with the sec investigation. marsh is also the focus of an inquiry the new york attorney-general into whether insurers rigged the market. since that inquiry was launched in october  marsh has replaced its chief executive and held a boardroom shake-out to meet criticism by lessening the number of company executives on the board. prosecutors allege that marsh - the world s biggest insurance broker - and other us insurance firms may have fixed bids for corporate cover. this is the issue at the heart of the inquiry by new york s top law officer  eliot spitzer  and a separate prosecution of five insurers by the state of california. the sec s investigation into so-called related party transactions includes dealings in the trident funds  managed by mmc capital  the company s private equity firm. marsh s new chief executive  michael cherkasky  is trying to negotiate a settlement with mr spitzer. mr spitzer has built up a reputation as a fierce critic and campaigner against corporate america s misdeeds.  the uncertainty unleashed by the scandal has prompted three credit rating agencies - standard & poor s  moody s and fitch - to downgrade marsh in recent weeks. according to the financial times  insurance analysts are now questioning whether marsh will be able to maintain its strong record of earning growth as they draw up forecasts for the first quarter of next year. doubts also exist over how much the company may have to pay regulators and lawyers to put the scandal behind.,troubl marsh sec scrutini u stock market regul investig troubl insur broker marsh mclennan sharehold transact firm say secur exchang commiss ask inform transact involv holder firm share marsh say cooper fulli sec investig marsh also focu inquiri new york attorneygener whether insur rig market sinc inquiri launch octob marsh replac chief execut held boardroom shakeout meet critic lessen number compani execut board prosecutor alleg marsh world big insur broker u insur firm may fix bid corpor cover issu heart inquiri new york top law offic eliot spitzer separ prosecut five insur state california sec investig socal relat parti transact includ deal trident fund manag mmc capit compani privat equiti firm marsh new chief execut michael cherkaski tri negoti settlement mr spitzer mr spitzer built reput fierc critic campaign corpor america misde uncertainti unleash scandal prompt three credit rate agenc standard poor moodi fitch downgrad marsh recent week accord financi time insur analyst question whether marsh abl maintain strong record earn growth draw forecast first quarter next year doubt also exist much compani may pay regul lawyer put scandal behind
128,860,finding new homes for old phones re-using old mobile phones is not just good for the environment  it has social benefits too.  research has found that in some developing nations old mobile phones can help close the digital divide. the forum for the future research found that the low cost of these recycled handsets means they can have a very useful second life in poorer nations. but the forum found that more needed to be done to collect old phones rather than let them rot in landfill sites.  the report reveals that approximately 15 million mobile phones go out of use every year in the uk. of the 15 million that are swapped for newer models each year  only 25% get returned to mobile phone firms for recycling or re-use. the slowly growing mass of unrecycled  discarded phones has now reached 90 million handsets  the equivalent of 9 000 tonnes of waste  estimates james goodman  report author and a senior adviser at the forum for the future.  it s quite common for people to have two or three phones just lying around   said mr goodman.  many of these older phones could end up in landfill sites leaking the potentially toxic materials they are made of into the wider world  said mr goodman. far better  he said  to hand the phone back to an operator who can send it overseas where it can enjoy a second lease of life.  we ve heard the environmental argument for handing a phone back   said mr goodman   but there s a strong social argument too.  older mobile phones are proving particularly useful in poorer nations where people want to use a mobile and keep in touch with friends and family but do not have the income to buy the most up to date model. the forum for the future report took an in-depth look at romania where reconditioned mobile phones were proving very popular.  it s an interesting country because it has a really crap fixed line network   said mr goodman   and there s a real desire for people to get mobile phones.  but the relatively low wages in romania  which is one of the poorest countries in europe  mean few people can afford a shiny new phone.  the affordability of the handsets is a real barrier to getting one   he said. reconditioned handsets have boosted take-up of mobiles as the report revealed that almost one-third of romanian pre-pay mobile phone users were using reconditioned handsets. the re-used handsets tend to be about one-third of the price of a new handset. georgeta minciu  a romanian part-time cleaner  said:  normally a mobile phone would not be possible on my wages. i am a single parent - keeping in touch with my daughter is important to me.   this is the only way i can afford to have a phone   she said. mr goodman said phone operators and consumers needed to do more to ensure that more of britain s mobile mountain made it overseas. but  he added  those keen to use a mobile will not accept any old handset.  if its more than a few years old people are not going to want it   he said.,find new home old phone reus old mobil phone good environ social benefit research found develop nation old mobil phone help close digit divid forum futur research found low cost recycl handset mean use second life poorer nation forum found need do collect old phone rather let rot landfil site report reveal approxim million mobil phone go use everi year uk million swap newer model year get return mobil phone firm recycl reus slowli grow mass unrecycl discard phone reach million handset equival tonn wast estim jame goodman report author senior advis forum futur quit common peopl two three phone lie around say mr goodman mani old phone could end landfil site leak potenti toxic materi make wider world say mr goodman far well say hand phone back oper send oversea enjoy second lea life heard environment argument hand phone back say mr goodman strong social argument old mobil phone prove particularli use poorer nation peopl want use mobil keep touch friend famili incom buy date model forum futur report take indepth look romania recondit mobil phone prove popular interest countri realli crap fix line network say mr goodman real desir peopl get mobil phone rel low wage romania one poorest countri europ mean peopl afford shini new phone afford handset real barrier get one say recondit handset boost takeup mobil report reveal almost onethird romanian prepay mobil phone user use recondit handset reus handset tend onethird price new handset georgeta minciu romanian parttim cleaner say normal mobil phone would possibl wage singl parent keep touch daughter import way afford phone say mr goodman say phone oper consum need ensur britain mobil mountain make oversea ad keen use mobil accept old handset year old peopl go want say

131,2030,friends fear  with lost mobiles people are becoming so dependent on their mobile phones that one in three are concerned that losing their phone would mean they lose their friends.  more than 50% of mobile owners reported they had had their phone stolen or lost in the last three years. more than half (54%) of those asked in a poll for mobile firm intervoice said that they do not have another address book. a fifth rely entirely on mobiles. about 80% of uk adults own at least one mobile  according to official figures. it is estimated that 53% of over 65s own a mobile  according to intervoice  but the figures are higher for those aged between 15 and 34.  most 15 to 24-year-olds (94%)  and 25 to 34-year-olds (92%)  own at least one. nineteen percent of mobile owners were more concerned about how long it would take to find their contacts  information again if the phone was lost  stolen or replaced.  the survey showed that extent to which people have become reliant on their phones as address book. many mobile owners do not bother to make back-ups of their contact details  and with people changing their phones once a year on average  it becomes a problem. they also are becoming less likely to remember numbers by heart  relying on the mobile phone book instead.  we re a nation of lazy so-and-sos   david noone from intervoice said.  we put the numbers in our phones so we can call a friend at the touch of just one or two buttons and we certainly can t be bothered to write them down in an old fashioned address book.  the mobile phone plays such a key role in modern relationships; take the phone away and the way we manage these relationships falls apart.  one in three women  the survey said  thought if they lost their phones  it would mean they would lose touch with people altogether. most (62%) said they had no idea what their partner s number was. mr noone said it should be up to mobile operators to provide back-up services on the network itself  instead of relying on mobile owners to find ways themselves.  generally  information from sim cards can be backed up on physical memory cards  or can be copied onto computers via cables if the phone is a smartphone model with the right software. sim back-up devices can be bought from phone shops for just a few pounds.  but some operators offer customers free web-based back-up services too. orange told the bbc news website that those with orange smartphones could use the my phone syncing service which means back-ups of address books and other data are created online. for non-smartphone users  a memory mate card could be used to back up data on the phone. o2 also offers a free  web-based syncing service which works over gprs and gsm. neither vodafone or t-mobile currently offer a free network service for back-ups  but encourage people to use sim back-up devices. it is thought that about 10 000 phones are lost or stolen every month and 50% of total street crime involves a mobile. mobile phone sales are expected to continue growing over the next year. globally  more than 167 million mobile phones were sold in the third quarter of 2004  26% more than the previous year  according to analysts. it is predicted that there will be two billion handsets in use worldwide by the end of 2005.,friend fear lose mobil peopl becom depend mobil phone one three concern lose phone would mean lose friend mobil owner report phone steal lose last three year half ask poll mobil firm intervoic say anoth address book fifth reli entir mobil uk adult least one mobil accord offici figur estim s mobil accord intervoic figur high age yearold yearold least one nineteen percent mobil owner concern long would take find contact inform phone lose steal replac survey show extent peopl becom reliant phone address book mani mobil owner bother make backup contact detail peopl chang phone year averag becom problem also becom less like rememb number heart reli mobil phone book instead nation lazi soandso david noon intervoic say put number phone call friend touch one two button certainli bother write old fashion address book mobil phone play key role modern relationship take phone away way manag relationship fall apart one three woman survey say thought lose phone would mean would lose touch peopl altogeth say idea partner number mr noon say mobil oper provid backup servic network instead reli mobil owner find way gener inform sim card back physic memori card copi onto comput via cabl phone smartphon model right softwar sim backup devic bought phone shop pound oper offer custom free webbas backup servic orang told bbc news websit orang smartphon could use phone sync servic mean backup address book data creat onlin nonsmartphon user memori mate card could use back data phone o also offer free webbas sync servic work gpr gsm neither vodafon tmobil current offer free network servic backup encourag peopl use sim backup devic thought phone lose steal everi month total street crime involv mobil mobil phone sale expect continu grow next year global million mobil phone sell third quarter previou year accord analyst predict two billion handset use worldwid end
132,666,uk  risks breaking golden rule  the uk government will have to raise taxes or rein in spending if it wants to avoid breaking its  golden rule   a report suggests.  the rule states that the government can borrow cash only to invest  and not to finance its spending projects. the national institute of economic and social research (niesr) claims that taxes need to rise by about £10bn if state finances are to be put in order. the treasury said its plans were on track and funded until 2008. according to niesr  if the government s current economic cycle runs until march 2006 then it is  unlikely  the golden rule will be met. should the cycle end a year earlier  then the chances improve to  50/50 . either way  fiscal tightening is needed  niesr said.  the report is the latest to call into question the viability of government spending projections. earlier this month  accountancy firm ernst & young said that chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown s forecasts for tax revenues were too optimistic.  it claimed revenues were likely to be £6bn below estimates by the end of the tax year despite the economy growing in line with forecasts. a treasury spokesperson dismissed the latest claims  saying it was  on track to meeting spending rules and the golden rule in the current cycle and beyond .  spending plans have been set out until 2008 and they are fully affordable.  other than its warning on possible tax hikes  the niesr report was optimistic about the state of the uk and global economy.  it said the recent record-busting surge in oil prices would have a limited effect on worldwide expansion  saying that if anything the  world economy will continue to grow strongly . global gross domestic product (gdp) is tipped to be 4.1% this year  dipping to 4% in 2005  before picking up again to 4.2% in 2006. the us will continue to drive expansion until 2006  albeit at a slightly slower rate  as will be the case in japan. hinting at better times for uk exporters  niesr said the euro zone  is expected to pick up speed .  growth in britain also is set to accelerate  it forecast.  despite weak growth in the third quarter  the forces sustaining the upswing remain intact and the economy will expand robustly in 2005 and 2006   niesr said  adding that  the economy will become better balanced over the next two years as exports stage a recovery . gdp is expected at 3.2% in 2004  and 2.8% in both 2005 and 2006. the main cloud on the horizon  niesr said  was the uk s much analysed and fretted over property market.,uk risk break golden rule uk govern rais tax rein spend want avoid break golden rule report suggest rule state govern borrow cash invest financ spend project nation institut econom social research niesr claim tax need rise £bn state financ put order treasuri say plan track fund accord niesr govern current econom cycl run march unlik golden rule met cycl end year earlier chanc improv either way fiscal tighten need niesr say report late call question viabil govern spend project earlier month account firm ernst young say chancellor exchequ gordon brown forecast tax revenu optimist claim revenu like £bn estim end tax year despit economi grow line forecast treasuri spokesperson dismiss late claim say track meet spend rule golden rule current cycl beyond spend plan set fulli afford warn possibl tax hike niesr report optimist state uk global economi say recent recordbust surg oil price would limit effect worldwid expans say anyth world economi continu grow strongli global gross domest product gdp tip year dip pick u continu drive expans albeit slightli slow rate case japan hint well time uk export niesr say euro zone expect pick speed growth britain also set acceler forecast despit weak growth third quarter forc sustain upsw remain intact economi expand robustli niesr say ad economi becom well balanc next two year export stage recoveri gdp expect main cloud horizon niesr say uk much analys fret properti market

134,1441,nat insurance to rise  say tories national insurance will be raised if labour wins the next election  tory leader michael howard has claimed.  tony blair has said he does not want higher tax rates for top earners but on wednesday said other tax promises would be left to labour s manifesto. prime minister s questions also saw mr blair predict that new plans would probably cut net immigration. he attacked tory plans to process asylum claims abroad - but mr howard said labour had proposed the idea too.  the commons questions session again saw the leaders of the two biggest parties shape up for the forthcoming election campaign. the tories have promised £4bn in tax cuts but have yet to say where they will fall. mr howard pointed to the institute for fiscal studies  predictions that labour will need to increase taxes to cover an £11bn gap in its spending plans. he accused ministers of wasting money on unsuccessful attempts to curb bad behaviour and truancy in schools and on slow asylum processing. it was no good mr blair claiming tax pledges were being left to the manifesto as he had given one to mps on tuesday about the top rate of income tax  argued mr howard. pointing to national insurance  he added:  everyone knows tax will go up under labour: isn t it now clear which tax it would be    mr blair instead hailed labour s achievement in using a strong economy to invest in public services.  when we have money not only going into extra teachers and nurses but equipment in schools and hospitals  that money is not wasted   he said. on the tax questions  he added:  we will make commitments on tax at the time of the manifesto.  home secretary charles clarke this week published plans for a new points system for economic migrants  with only high-skilled workers allowed into the uk from outside the european union.  mr blair said abuses would be weeded out and chain migration  where families automatically get the right to settle with immigrant workers  would end. that would probably create a fall in the migrant numbers  he said. the prime minister ridiculed the tory plans for asylum quotas and for processing all asylum claims overseas. he challenged the tories on which country would house their processing centres - what he called a  fantasy island . mr howard read from a letter about the government s own plans at the european council of ministers for processing asylum seekers outside the eu. but mr blair said:  all the other countries could not agree on the way forward  nor could the un.,nat insur rise say torus nation insur rais labour win next elect torus leader michael howard claim toni blair say want high tax rate top earner wednesday say tax promis would left labour manifesto prime minist question also saw mr blair predict new plan would probabl cut net immigr attack torus plan process asylum claim abroad mr howard say labour propos idea common question session saw leader two big parti shape forthcom elect campaign torus promis £bn tax cut yet say fall mr howard point institut fiscal studi predict labour need increas tax cover £bn gap spend plan accus minist wast money unsuccess attempt curb bad behaviour truanci school slow asylum process good mr blair claim tax pledg left manifesto give one mp tuesday top rate incom tax argu mr howard point nation insur ad everyon know tax go labour clear tax would mr blair instead hail labour achiev use strong economi invest public servic money go extra teacher nurs equip school hospit money wast say tax question ad make commit tax time manifesto home secretari charl clark week publish plan new point system econom migrant highskil worker allow uk outsid european union mr blair say abus would weed chain migrat famili automat get right settl immigr worker would end would probabl creat fall migrant number say prime minist ridicul torus plan asylum quota process asylum claim oversea challeng torus countri would hous process centr call fantasi island mr howard read letter govern plan european council minist process asylum seeker outsid eu mr blair say countri could agre way forward could un
135,1070,dollar drops on reserves concerns the us dollar has dropped against major currencies on concerns that central banks may cut the amount of dollars they hold in their foreign reserves.  comments by south korea s central bank at the end of last week have sparked the recent round of dollar declines. south korea  which has about $200bn in foreign reserves  said it plans instead to boost holdings of currencies such as the australian and canadian dollar. analysts reckon that other nations may follow suit and now ditch the dollar. at 1300 gmt  the euro was up 0.9% on the day at 1.3187 euros per us dollar. the british pound had added 0.5% to break through the $1.90 level  while the dollar had fallen by 1.3% against the japanese yen to trade at 104.16 yen.  at the start of the year  the us currency  which had lost 7% against the euro in the final three months of 2004 and had fallen to record lows  staged something of a recovery.  analysts  however  pointed to the dollar s inability recently to extend that rally despite positive economic and corporate data  and highlighted the fact that many of the us s economic problems had not disappeared. the focus once again has been on the country s massive trade and budget deficits  with predictions of more dollar weakness to come.  the comments from korea came at a time when sentiment towards the dollar was already softening   said ian gunner  a trader at mellon financial. on tuesday  traders in asia said that both south korea and taiwan had withdrawn their bids to buy dollars at the start of the session. mansoor mohi-uddin  chief currency strategist at ubs  said that there was a sentiment in the market that  central banks from asia and the middle east are buying euros . a report last month already showed that the dollar was losing its allure as a currency that offered rock-steady returns and stability. compiled by central banking publications and sponsored by the uk s royal bank of scotland  the survey found 39 nations out of 65 questioned were increasing their euro holdings  with 29 cutting back on the us dollar.,dollar drop reserv concern u dollar drop major currenc concern central bank may cut amount dollar hold foreign reserv comment south korea central bank end last week spark recent round dollar declin south korea bn foreign reserv say plan instead boost hold currenc australian canadian dollar analyst reckon nation may follow suit ditch dollar gmt euro day euro per u dollar british pound ad break level dollar fall japanes yen trade yen start year u currenc lose euro final three month fall record low stage someth recoveri analyst howev point dollar inabl recent extend ralli despit posit econom corpor data highlight fact mani u econom problem disappear focu countri massiv trade budget deficit predict dollar weak come comment korea come time sentiment toward dollar alreadi soften say ian gunner trader mellon financi tuesday trader asia say south korea taiwan withdrawn bid buy dollar start session mansoor mohiuddin chief currenc strategist ub say sentiment market central bank asia middl east buy euro report last month alreadi show dollar lose allur currenc offer rocksteadi return stabil compil central bank public sponsor uk royal bank scotland survey found nation question increas euro hold cut back u dollar

138,1331,palestinian economy in decline despite a short-lived increase in palestinian jobs in 2003  the economy is performing well below its potential  said a world bank report.  unemployment stood at 25%  compared with 10% before the uprising against israeli occupation four years ago. young people are particularly hard hit with 37% out of work  compared with 14% four years ago. but 104 000 new jobs were created last year during a brief easing of violence and closures. however  during the first half of this year  the palestinian economy lost more than 22 000 jobs. last year s growth rate of 6% can also be attributed to this temporary gap in violence  the report said. according to the report  intifada  closures and palestinian economic crisis: an assessment  there is a close link between the number of closures - both border closures and internal closures between cities - and palestinian economic problems. the closures arranged by israel restrict the movement of palestinian people and goods  slowing down trade.   closures are a key factor behind today s economic crisis in the west bank   said nigel roberts  world bank country director for the west bank and gaza. nearly half of all palestinians - some 47% - live below the poverty line and are particularly vulnerable to economic shocks. the report said even more would be on the poverty line without an average of $950m a year from international donors  some of which goes towards job creation. it also called on the palestinian authority to revive its reform programme and maintain financial discipline to create an investment-friendly climate. this week colin powell  us secretary of state was visiting the west bank to stress us support for a smooth palestinian election in january.,palestinian economi declin despit shortliv increas palestinian job economi perform well potenti say world bank report unemploy stood compar upris isra occup four year ago young peopl particularli hard hit work compar four year ago new job creat last year brief ea violenc closur howev first half year palestinian economi lose job last year growth rate also attribut temporari gap violenc report say accord report intifada closur palestinian econom crisi ass close link number closur border closur intern closur citi palestinian econom problem closur arrang israel restrict movement palestinian peopl good slow trade closur key factor behind today econom crisi west bank say nigel robert world bank countri director west bank gaza nearli half palestinian live poverti line particularli vulner econom shock report say even would poverti line without averag m year intern donor goe toward job creation also call palestinian author reviv reform programm maintain financi disciplin creat investmentfriendli climat week colin powel u secretari state visit west bank stress u support smooth palestinian elect januari
139,1964,imf agrees fresh turkey funding turkey has agreed a draft proposal with the international monetary fund to borrow $10bn (£5.19bn)  extending its ongoing financial support until 2007.  turkey s current $18.6bn loan agreement with the imf expires in february and the new deal would see it receive added support between 2005 and 2007. in return for the funding  turkey would be expected to keep inflation under control and introduce market reforms. turkey s economy has steadily recovered from a severe crisis in 2001.  economic growth has average 6-7% in the past three years  ahead of imf forecasts  while inflation fell below 10% this year for the first time in 30 years. however  turkey has a huge debt burden - already owing $23bn to the imf - while its current account deficit has swelled to $10.7bn this year.  the turkish economics minister  ali babacan  said the two sides had reached general agreement on a new three year funding program. rodrigo de rato  the imf s managing director  said the loan agreement would help to improve turkish economic prospects by cutting its debt and stimulating growth.  i believe the new programme  if implemented successfully  will help turkey create the conditions for sustained growth and employment creation  reduce inflation toward european level and enhance the economy s resilience   he said. the agreement must still be ratified by imf directors at a meeting expected to take place next month.  the agreement would also enable turkey to defer payments on previous loans worth $3.7m until 2006.  as part of the draft agreement  turkey has signed a  letter of intent  stating its determination to push through far-reaching reforms to its tax and benefits system and its banking sector. such reforms are considered vital for turkey if it is to fulfil its ambition of joining the european union. the eu will decide on 17 december whether to begin entry talks with turkey. the us  the largest of the imf s 184 members  is a strong supporter of continued financial support for turkey.,imf agre fresh turkey fund turkey agre draft propos intern monetari fund borrow bn £bn extend ongo financi support turkey current bn loan agreement imf expir februari new deal would see receiv ad support return fund turkey would expect keep inflat control introduc market reform turkey economi steadili recov sever crisi econom growth averag past three year ahead imf forecast inflat fell year first time year howev turkey huge debt burden alreadi owe bn imf current account deficit swell bn year turkish econom minist ali babacan say two side reach gener agreement new three year fund program rodrigo de rato imf manag director say loan agreement would help improv turkish econom prospect cut debt stimul growth believ new programm implement success help turkey creat condit sustain growth employ creation reduc inflat toward european level enhanc economi resili say agreement must still ratifi imf director meet expect take place next month agreement would also enabl turkey defer payment previou loan worth m part draft agreement turkey sign letter intent state determin push farreach reform tax benefit system bank sector reform consid vital turkey fulfil ambit join european union eu decid decemb whether begin entri talk turkey u large imf member strong support continu financi support turkey
140,1977,mobile music challenges  ipod age  nokia and microsoft have agreed a deal to work on delivery of music to handsets  while sony ericsson has unveiled its phone walkman and motorola is working on an itunes phone.  can mobile phones replace the mp3 player in your pocket  the music download market has been growing steadily since record firms embraced digital distribution. ease of use  relative low price and increased access to broadband has helped drive the phenomenal growth of mp3 players.  full-length music downloads on mobile phones have not taken off so quickly - held back by technical challenges as well as issues over music availability. but the mobile music industry is confident that the days of dedicated mp3 players are numbered.  gilles babinet  chief executive of mobile music firm musiwave  said:  music downloads on mobiles have the potential to be the biggest-ever medium for music.   musiwave provides downloading infrastructure for the mobile phone market and mr babinet said the industry was enjoying  definite momentum.  but there are hurdles to overcome. mobile phones offer limited storage for music - certainly nothing to rival apple s 60gb ipod. but the first mobile phones with hard disk players will be on the market soon and the current generation of mobiles using flash technology can store up to one gigabyte of music - enough for 250 songs.  we are working in the hard disk area and we will be bringing out exciting devices   jonas guest  vice president for entertainment at nokia  told the bbc news website. but will mobiles become mere storage devices   one of the problems we could have is that mobiles are used just for storage and playback while pcs are used for downloading   said mr babinet   we don t want people to cast aside their pcs - we want mobile users to hook up into the existing ecosystems   explained mr guest.  you must enable people to transfer music from a pc to a handset and vice versa.   one of the key elements of the nokia and microsoft deal is the agreed ability to transfer songs between a handset and a pc. microsoft will adopt open standards allowing music to cross boundaries for the first time. songs can be downloaded on pc or mobile and transferred between the platforms.  the line between online and wireless is going to blur   predicted ted cohen  senior vice president of digital development and distribution at emi. he said:  the market is more regional in its maturity. in asia it is beyond belief.  the majority of our digital revenues in asia comes from mobiles. in north america it is fixed line while there is equilibrium in europe.   emi currently offers its entire 200 000 download catalogue for use by both by pcs and mobile phones. mr cohen said:  it s going to be just as important to connect through 3g or wireless as it is through your pc.  we want music to be a continuum.  the seamless experience of mobiles and pc downloads is approaching  he predicted. mr babinet said the mobile phone had a number of advantages over pcs which would see it become the focus for music downloading in the future.  getting music from your pc onto a device is not an easy experience. you have to switch the pc on  load the operating system  load the program  buy the music  download the music  and then transfer the music.  all of these steps can be done in one step on a mobile phone.  he said the mobile phone s billing system would make it easier for teenagers to embrace downloads  because pre-paid cards were already accepted by the age group.   certainly  we have a problem with battery  memory and bandwidth. but it s not about the current status. it s about the potential.  you will have all of your music on your mobile.  all three men said that the social interaction of mobile music would drive the market. mr cohen said:  i can send you the song and it is either billed to me or i send it to you and if you listen to it and want to keep  it is billed to you.  it s a social phenomenon.  mr babinet said:  today you use radio and tv to discover music. tomorrow you will discover and consume music via one device -

141,1450,taylor poised for scotland return simon taylor has been named in the scotland squad for saturday s six nations clash with italy.  the 25-year-old number eight made a scoring return for edinburgh at the weekend - his first game in a year for the capital side. taylor suffered knee ligament damage playing against ireland in dublin in the 2004 six nations championship.  simon is one of scotland s truly world class players so it is a huge bonus   said team-mate chris paterson.  he brings a whole new dimension to us  especially in defence and his ability to slow the opposition ball down could be key against italy if he is involved.  taylor has turned out for english side saracens in recent weeks during a short-term loan to improve his fitness.  edinburgh were not in action during the first two weeks of this season s six nations. so taylor played the last 20 minutes of saracens  win over northampton and then 40 minutes in a friendly against south african super 12 side the cats. scotland coach matt williams is due to name his match-day 22 on thursday. both scotland and italy have lost their opening two six nations games and  just like last season s encounter which italy won  this weekend s game could turn out to be a battle to avoid the wooden spoon.  - m blair (edinburgh)  a craig (glasgow)  c cusiter (borders)  s danielli (borders)  m di rollo (edinburgh)  a henderson (glasgow)  b hinshelwood (worcester)  r lamont (glasgow)  s lamont (glasgow)  d parks (glasgow)  c paterson (edinburgh)  g ross (leeds)  h southwell (edinburgh)  s webster (edinburgh)  - r beattie (northampton)  g bulloch (glasgow  capt)  b douglas (borders)  j dunbar (leeds)  i fullarton (saracens)  s grimes (newcastle)  n hines (edinburgh)  a hogg (edinburgh)  g kerr (leeds)  n lloyd (saracens)  s murray (edinburgh)  j petrie (glasgow)  r russell (london irish)  c smith (edinburgh)  t smith (northampton)  s taylor (edinburgh)  j white (sale).,taylor poi scotland return simon taylor name scotland squad saturday six nation clash itali yearold number eight make score return edinburgh weekend first game year capit side taylor suffer knee ligament damag play ireland dublin six nation championship simon one scotland truli world class player huge bonu say teammat chri paterson bring whole new dimens u especi defenc abil slow opposit ball could key itali involv taylor turn english side saracen recent week shortterm loan improv fit edinburgh action first two week season six nation taylor play last minut saracen win northampton minut friendli south african super side cat scotland coach matt william due name matchday thursday scotland itali lose open two six nation game like last season encount itali weekend game could turn battl avoid wooden spoon blair edinburgh craig glasgow c cusit border danielli border di rollo edinburgh henderson glasgow b hinshelwood worcest r lamont glasgow lamont glasgow park glasgow c paterson edinburgh g ross leed h southwel edinburgh webster edinburgh r beatti northampton g bulloch glasgow capt b dougla border j dunbar leed fullarton saracen grime newcastl n hine edinburgh hogg edinburgh g kerr leed n lloyd saracen murray edinburgh j petri glasgow r russel london irish c smith edinburgh smith northampton taylor edinburgh j white sale
142,1728,serena ends sania mirza s dream sania mirza  the first indian woman to reach the third round of a grand slam tennis event  has lost to women s favourite serena williams.  the 18-year-old mirza  who got a wild card entry into the australian open in melbourne  lost to williams 1-6 4-6 in the third round. williams took just 56 minutes to defeat mirza and sail into the fourth round. the only other indian woman to win a match at a grand slam is nirupama vaidyanathan. vaidyanathan made it to the second round of the australian open in 1998.  playing the biggest match of her life  mirza made little impact on williams in the early stages of the game. but the teenager showed more confidence in the second set and engaged the seventh-seeded williams in some well contested rallies. mirza  a junior wimbledon doubles title winner  became the first indian woman to reach the third round of a grand slam tennis event when she beat hungarian petra mandula on wednesday.  i m really excited. i was confident but i didn t think it was going to be that easy   mirza said after her second round win.  my aim was to win a round here. when i did that i was so relieved  there was no pressure.  tennis is not a particularly popular sport in india  but a number of indians watched the live telecast of the match between mirza and williams. mirza  who lives in the southern indian city of hyderabad known for producing a host of top indian cricketers  turned professional two years ago. she says she was considered too small when she went for her first tennis classes as a six-year-old girl.  then finally [the coach] called my parents up and said  the way she hits the ball  i ve never seen a six-year-old hit a ball like that    mirza told the associated press.,serena end sania mirza dream sania mirza first indian woman reach third round grand slam tenni event lose woman favourit serena william yearold mirza get wild card entri australian open melbourn lose william third round william take minut defeat mirza sail fourth round indian woman win match grand slam nirupama vaidyanathan vaidyanathan make second round australian open play big match life mirza make littl impact william earli stage game teenag show confid second set engag seventhseed william well contest ralli mirza junior wimbledon doubl titl winner becam first indian woman reach third round grand slam tenni event beat hungarian petra mandula wednesday realli excit confid think go easi mirza say second round win aim win round reliev pressur tenni particularli popular sport india number indian watch live telecast match mirza william mirza live southern indian citi hyderabad know produc host top indian cricket turn profession two year ago say consid small go first tenni class sixyearold girl final coach call parent say way hit ball never see sixyearold hit ball like mirza told associ press
143,1073,windows worm travels with tetris users are being warned about a windows virus that poses as the hugely popular tetris game.  the cellery worm installs a playable version of the classic falling blocks game on pcs that it has infected. while users play the game  the worm spends its time using the machine to search for new victims to infect on nearby networks. the risk of infection by cellery is thought to be very low as few copies of the worm have been found in the wild.  the cellery worm does not spread via e-mail like many other viruses. instead it browses computer networks for pcs that have not shut off all the insecure ways they connect to other machines. when it infects a machine  cellery installs a version of tetris that users can play. as the game starts up the worm also starts a music file to accompany it. at the same time the virus starts scouring networks for other vulnerable machines. the virus does no damage to machines but heavily infected networks could slow down as scanning traffic builds. productivity may suffer too if users spend time playing tetris. pcs running windows 95  98  me  nt  2000  and xp could be vulnerable to the worm.  if your company has a culture of allowing games to be played in the office  your staff may believe this is simply a new game that has been installed - rather than something that should cause concern   said graham cluley  spokesman for anti-virus firm sophos. so far the number of people infected by cellery is thought to be very small and the risks of further infection is very low. sophos urged users and companies to update their anti-virus software to keep themselves protected.,window worm travel tetri user warn window viru pose huge popular tetri game celleri worm instal playabl version classic fall block game pc infect user play game worm spend time use machin search new victim infect nearbi network risk infect celleri thought low copi worm found wild celleri worm spread via email like mani virus instead brow comput network pc shut insecur way connect machin infect machin celleri instal version tetri user play game start worm also start music file accompani time viru start scour network vulner machin viru damag machin heavili infect network could slow scan traffic build product may suffer user spend time play tetri pc run window nt xp could vulner worm compani cultur allow game play offic staff may believ simpli new game instal rather someth caus concern say graham cluley spokesman antiviru firm sopho far number peopl infect celleri thought small risk infect low sopho urg user compani updat antiviru softwar keep protect
144,1338,big war games battle it out the arrival of new titles in the popular medal of honor and call of duty franchises leaves fans of wartime battle titles spoilt for choice.  the acclaimed pc title call of duty has been updated for console formats  building on many of the original s elements. for its part  the long-running medal of honor series has added pacific assault to its pc catalogue  adapting the console game rising sun. call of duty: finest hour casts you as a succession of allied soldiers fighting on world war 2 battlefronts including russia and north africa. it is a traditional first-person-viewed game that lets you control just one character  in the midst of a unit where cohorts constantly bark orders at you. on a near-identical note  medal of honor: pacific assault does all it can to make you feel part of a tight-knit team and plum in the middle of all-out action. its arenas are the war s pacific battles  including guadalcanal and pearl harbour. you play one character throughout  a raw and rather talkative us soldier.  both games rely on a carefully stage-managed structure that keeps things ticking along. when this works  it is a brilliant device to make you feel part of a story. when it does not  it is tedious.  a winning moment is an early scene in pacific assault  where you come under attack at the famous us base in hawaii. you are first ushered into a gunboat attacking the incoming waves of japanese planes  then made to descend into a sinking battleship to rescue crewman  before seizing the anti-aircraft guns. it is one of the finest set-pieces ever seen in a video game. this notion of shuffling the player along a studiously pre-determined path  forcibly witnessing a series of pre-set moments of action  is a perilous business which can make the whole affair feel stilted rather than organic. the genius of something like half life 2 is that it skilfully disguises its linear plotting by various means of misdirection. this pair of games do not really accomplish that  being more concerned with imparting a full-on atmospheric experience.  call of duty comes with a suitably bombastic score and overblown presentation. finest hour has a similar determination  framing everything in moody wartime music  archive footage and lots of reflective voice-overs.  letting you play a number of different roles is an interesting ploy that adds new dimensions to the call of duty endeavour  even if it sacrifices the narrative flow somewhat. the game s drawback could be said to be its format; tastes differ  but these wartime shooters often do seem to work better on pc. the mouse control is a big reason why  along with the sharper graphics a top-end computer can muster and the apparent notion that pc games are allowed to get away with a bit more subtlety. call of duty on pc was more detailed  plot-wise and graphically  and this new adaptation feels a little rough and ready. targeting with the ps2 controller proved tricky  not helped by unconvincing collision-detection. you can shoot an enemy repeatedly with zero question as to your aim  yet the bullets will just refuse to hit him. checkpoints are so few and far between that when you get shot  which happens regularly  you are set harshly far back  and will find yourself covering vast tracts of scorched earth again and again. the game wants to be a challenge  and is  and many players will like it for that. it is as dynamic a battlefield simulator as you will experience and even if it is not as refined as its pc parent  the sense of being part of the action is thoroughly impressive.  both of these games feature military colleagues who are disturbingly bad shots and prone to odd behaviour. and in pacific assault in particular  their commands and comments are irritatingly meaningless.  but the teamwork element in titles like this is superficial  designed to add atmosphere and camaraderie rather than affect the gameplay mechanics at all. of the two games  pacific assault gets more things right  including little points like auto-saving intelligently and having tidier presentation. it engages you very well and also looks wonderful  making the most of the lush tropical settings that are reminiscent of the glorious far cry  although we had to ramp up the settings on a high-spec machine to get the most out of them. finest hour is by no means bad  and it is only because the pc original was so dazzling that this version sometimes feels underwhelming. those looking for a wartime game with plenty of atmosphere and a hearty abundance of enemies to shoot will be contented. but they will also have a niggling puzzlement as to why it does not break a little more ground rather then just being competent.,big war game battl arriv new titl popular medal honor call duti franchis leav fan wartim battl titl spoilt choic acclaim pc titl call duti updat consol format build mani origin element part longrun medal honor seri ad pacif assault pc catalogu adapt consol game rise sun call duti fine hour cast success alli soldier fight world war battlefront includ russia north africa tradit firstpersonview game let control one charact midst unit cohort constantli bark order nearident note medal honor pacif assault make feel part tightknit team plum middl allout action arena war pacif battl includ guadalcan pearl harbour play one charact throughout raw rather talk u soldier game reli care stagemanag structur keep thing tick along work brilliant devic make feel part stori tediou win moment earli scene pacif assault come attack famou u base hawaii first usher gunboat attack incom wave japanes plane make descend sink battleship rescu crewman seiz antiaircraft gun one fine setpiec ever see video game notion shuffl player along studious predetermin path forcibl wit seri preset moment action peril busi make whole affair feel stilt rather organ geniu someth like half life skil disguis linear plot variou mean misdirect pair game realli accomplish concern impart fullon atmospher experi call duti come suitabl bombast score overblown present fine hour similar determin frame everyth moodi wartim music archiv footag lot reflect voiceov let play number differ role interest ploy add new dimens call duti endeavour even sacrific narr flow somewhat game drawback could say format tast differ wartim shooter often seem work well pc mous control big reason along sharper graphic topend comput muster appar notion pc game allow get away bit subtleti call duti pc detail plotwis graphic new adapt feel littl rough readi target p control prove tricki help unconvinc collisiondetect shoot enemi repeatedli zero question aim yet bullet refus hit checkpoint far get shot happen regularli set harshli far back find cover vast tract scorch earth game want challeng mani player like dynam battlefield simul experi even refin pc parent sen part action thoroughli impress game featur militari colleagu disturbingli bad shot prone odd behaviour pacif assault particular command comment irritatingli meaningless teamwork element titl like superfici design add atmospher camaraderi rather affect gameplay mechan two game pacif assault get thing right includ littl point like autosav intellig tidier present engag well also look wonder make lush tropic set reminisc gloriou far cri although ramp set highspec machin get fine hour mean bad pc origin dazzl version sometim feel underwhelm look wartim game plenti atmospher hearti abund enemi shoot content also niggl puzzlement break littl ground rather compet

148,1183,three djs replace peel radio show the late john peel s bbc radio 1 show is to be succeeded in february by three shows hosted by three djs focusing on diverse  non-commercial music.  huw stephens  ras kwame and rob da bank will each host the mid-week  late-night timeslot  showcasing uk talent. radio 1 said the show would not try to replace peel  but would rise to the  challenge  of  keeping his legacy alive  with unpredictable music. peel died after suffering a heart attack in peru in october. radio 1 said the three djs had been chosen for their  in-depth musical knowledge across a variety of musical genres . rob da bank has been hosting the john peel show since the dj s death. he is also one of the hosts of the blue room  an early morning weekend show that plays a mix of old and new electronic and dance music. huw stephens is currently one half of the radio 1 thursday night show bethan and huw in wales  which explores new music  especially up and coming acts breaking through in wales. and ras kwame is the host of 100% homegrown on radio 1 s digital station 1xtra. his show is dedicated to showcasing the best of uk black music and broadcasts live sessions  often giving new artists their first chance to perform on live national radio.  all of the three djs will continue to host their current shows on radio 1.  it is widely accepted that john peel can never be replaced   said the radio station. it added that one music would support both signed and unsigned talent  and said:  it will seek out those making music for music s sake rather than for commercial success.  above all it will provide support to emerging genres of music and styles that have not yet and may never reach the mainstream.   one music is not new to radio 1 as it already exists as a website  offering advice on aspects of the music industry  such as recording a demo and signing a record contract. radio 1 s controller  andy parfitt  said:  we believe that by having a series of djs hosting a selection of shows under the one music title  we will ensure that his legacy lives on.  stephens said he grew up  listening to john  and that it was a  massive honour  to continue peel s work championing new music. the show will be broadcast from 1 february on tuesdays  wednesdays and thursdays from 2300 gmt - 0100 gmt.,three dj replac peel radio show late john peel bbc radio show succeed februari three show host three dj focus diver noncommerci music huw stephen ra kwame rob da bank host midweek latenight timeslot showcas uk talent radio say show would tri replac peel would rise challeng keep legaci aliv unpredict music peel die suffer heart attack peru octob radio say three dj chosen indepth music knowledg across varieti music genr rob da bank host john peel show sinc dj death also one host blue room earli morn weekend show play mix old new electron danc music huw stephen current one half radio thursday night show bethan huw wale explor new music especi come act break wale ra kwame host homegrown radio digit station xtra show dedic showcas best uk black music broadcast live session often give new artist first chanc perform live nation radio three dj continu host current show radio wide accept john peel never replac say radio station ad one music would support sign unsign talent say seek make music music sake rather commerci success provid support emerg genr music style yet may never reach mainstream one music new radio alreadi exist websit offer advic aspect music industri record demo sign record contract radio control andi parfitt say believ seri dj host select show one music titl ensur legaci live stephen say grow listen john massiv honour continu peel work champion new music show broadcast februari tuesday wednesday thursday gmt gmt
149,76,tech helps disabled speed demons an organisation has been launched to encourage disabled people to get involved in all aspects of motorsport  which is now increasingly possible thanks to technological innovations.  the motorsport endeavour club left the starting grid yesterday at the autosport international 2005 show at birmingham s nec  with several technologies to adapt vehicles on display.  motorcycle racer  roy tansley  from derby developed his electronic sequential gear changer following an accident which resulted in part of his left leg being amputated.  i needed to find a way of changing gear and generally you do that with your left leg   mr tansley told the bbc news website.  in simple terms  i needed to invent a left foot - initially it was quite a heath robinson device.  mr tansley had to argue his case to be allowed to continue competing with motorcycle racing s governing body  the autocycle union.  at that time they wouldn t let any amputee race at all  but eventually they told me i could have a licence as long as i raced sidecars.  mr tansley s invention  the pro-shift  is designed to work with hewland gearboxes which are widely used in motorcycle racing. in addition to helping disabled riders to compete  mr tansley reckons that the pro-shift saves at least 20 seconds per lap when he competes in the isle of man tt. as a result  there has been considerable interest in the product from other riders keen to improve their performance.  i m not prejudiced  i ll sell to able-bodied people if i have to!  he joked.  another exhibit on the motorsport endeavour stand is a subaru impreza rally car  adapted to accommodate a variety of disabilities. the vehicle belongs to pararallying  the world s only rally school for disabled drivers which is based in lincolnshire.   we use the latest technology supplied by an italian company   said rally driver dave hawkins who runs the company.  the cars have electronic throttles  electronic brakes  electronic clutches - we ve yet to turn anybody away.  mr hawkins - a paraplegic himself - says his customers have included right or left arm amputees  quadriplegics  people who have had strokes and a woman who had had all four limbs amputated. pararallying uses a vauxhall astra gsi with an automatic gearbox and manual subaru imprezas. the car on display is fitted with a  duck clutch  - a switch on the gear stick used instead of the clutch pedal. it also has a second ring behind the steering wheel to operate the throttle and a hand operated brake bar.  when joy rainey started competing in motorsport in 1974 she was continuing the family tradition - her father  murray  is a former australian formula 3 champion.  and it was rainey senior who modified a sports racer to accommodate his daughter s small stature so that she could take part in hill climbs. she uses an ordinary road car by putting extensions on the pedals  a cushion behind her back and raising the seat.  but in a competition car you have to have everything right or you ll lose the balance of the car   she said.  i bring everything back to me - steering wheel  steering column  gear lever and pedals.  when she recently took part in the london to sydney marathon she shared the driving with her partner  trevor  who now does the engineering work. he designed a system for their morris minor so that the adaptations could be totally removed in under a minute. the motorsport endeavour club is hoping that putting such technologies on display will result in more disabled people becoming involved in all areas of the sport and at every level.,tech help disabl speed demon organis launch encourag disabl peopl get involv aspect motorsport increasingli possibl thank technolog innov motorsport endeavour club left start grid yesterday autosport intern show birmingham nec sever technolog adapt vehicl display motorcycl racer roy tansley derbi develop electron sequenti gear changer follow accid result part left leg amput need find way chang gear gener left leg mr tansley told bbc news websit simpl term need invent left foot initi quit heath robinson devic mr tansley argu case allow continu compet motorcycl race govern bodi autocycl union time let ampute race eventu told could licenc long race sidecar mr tansley invent proshift design work hewland gearbox wide use motorcycl race addit help disabl rider compet mr tansley reckon proshift save least second per lap compet isl man tt result consider interest product rider keen improv perform prejud sell ablebodi peopl joke anoth exhibit motorsport endeavour stand subaru impreza ralli car adapt accommod varieti disabl vehicl belong parar world ralli school disabl driver base lincolnshir use late technolog suppli italian compani say ralli driver dave hawkin run compani car electron throttl electron brake electron clutch yet turn anybodi away mr hawkin parapleg say custom includ right left arm ampute quadripleg peopl stroke woman four limb amput parar use vauxhal astra gsi automat gearbox manual subaru impreza car display fit duck clutch switch gear stick use instead clutch pedal also second ring behind steer wheel oper throttl hand oper brake bar joy rainey start compet motorsport continu famili tradit father murray former australian formula champion rainey senior modifi sport racer accommod daughter small statur could take part hill climb use ordinari road car put extens pedal cushion behind back rais seat competit car everyth right lose balanc car say bring everyth back steer wheel steer column gear lever pedal recent take part london sydney marathon share drive partner trevor engin work design system morri minor adapt could total remov minut motorsport endeavour club hope put technolog display result disabl peopl becom involv area sport everi level

151,675,the pirates with no profit motive two men who were part of a huge network of internet software pirates  known as drink or die  have been convicted at the old bailey. bbc news investigates how the network worked and what motivated those involved.  they called themselves drink or die (dod). they were a network of computer buffs who derived pleasure from cracking codes protecting copyrighted software such as windows 95. they would then share it with each other. there is no suggestion any of them profited financially. but the authorities in both britain and the united states considered it software piracy and took a dim view of networks such as dod  one of a number of so-called warez organisations operating on the internet. in october 2000 the us customs service began an investigation into dod and other networks  such as razor 1911  risciso  myth and popz.  fourteen months later us customs co-ordinated a series of raids across the globe as part of operation buccaneer. seventy search warrants were executed in the us  britain  australia  norway  sweden and finland. at least 60 people were arrested worldwide - 45 of them in the us. among the leaders of the network were americans john sankus - known by his internet nickname eriflleh (hellfire spelt backwards) - richard berry  kent kartadinata and christopher tresco  who used a server based at the prestigious massachusetts institute of technology (mit).  the longest jail sentence - 46 months - was handed down to sankus  a 28-year-old from philadelphia. us attorney paul mcnulty said at the time:  john sankus and his techno-gang operated in the faceless world of the internet and thought they would never be caught.  they were wrong. these sentences  and those to follow  should send a message to others entertaining similar beliefs of invincibility.  but one man still in legal limbo is british-born australian hew raymond griffiths  who is still fighting against extradition to the us.  us customs claimed mr griffiths was one of dod s leaders but his lawyer  antony townsden  told the bbc news website it was a laughable suggestion and added:  he was living on welfare and had such an old computer that he couldn t even download software.  the allegation that he was the group s co-leader is illusory. he had the least technical skills of anyone  he couldn t crack any codes and he has only been called a leader because he was a loudmouth who wrote a lot on their messageboard.  mr townsden said if he had committed any crimes he should be prosecuted in australia  not the us. he claimed the australian government s decision to accept the extradition request was typical of their current  acquiescent  attitude to the us.  mr griffiths is expecting to hear this week the outcome of his appeal against the decision to extradite him. those involved would give themselves internet aliases which would act in the same way as tags used by graffiti artists. they could then brag about their code-cracking abilities without giving away their real identities. alex bell  whose trial at the old bailey ended on friday  was known as mr 2940 - after a computer device - while his co-defendant steven dowd s nickname  curiously  was tim.  a spokesman for us immigration  customs and enforcement  dean boyd  said dod did not appear to be motivated by money. their motivation was the kudos which surrounded being able to crack sophisticated software. he told the bbc news website:  primarily they were just interested in how fast they could crack the code. it was all about underground notoriety.  but mr boyd pointed out that once the software had been distributed on the internet it fell into the hands of organised criminals who were able to mass produce pirated software at zero cost.   it cost us industries a lot of money  billions of dollars   he said. mr boyd said:  it was truly global in scope. we raided a number of universities  including duke (in north carolina) and mit  and found that several of the people involved were employed by major computer corporations.  they would go home from work in the evenings and get involved in this warez culture.  warez groups  which began to surface in the early 1990s  operate according to a strict code of honour.  for example if one group cracked the software first its rivals would respect that achievement and not seek to claim it themselves. mr boyd said the destruction of dod was a great coup but he added:  i m not going to sit here and say we have sorted the problem. there are still hackers and people who do this for fun.  internet piracy of computer software remains a gigantic problem.  a spokesman for the business software alliance said:  dod members claim they did not profit at all. but they did profit by getting access to very expensive servers.  he said dod and other warez groups were fostering a  culture of piracy  on the internet. he said 29% of computer software in britain was believed to have been pirated and this cost £1bn in revenue for software companies  their suppliers and distributors.  it may seem like a victimless crime but it touches more people than you might care to believe.,pirat profit motiv two men part huge network internet softwar pirat know drink die convict old bailey bbc news investig network work motiv involv call drink die dod network comput buff deriv

153,699,britain boosted by holmes double athletics fans endured a year of mixed emotions in 2004 as stunning victories went hand-in-hand with disappointing defeats and more drugs scandals.  kelly

final of 1500m at the world indoor championships where she was favourite. her olympic build-up was clouded by self doubt but that proved unfounded as she overhauled rival maria mutola to win the 800m - her first global title. just five days later  the 34-year-old made it double gold in the 1500m. it was the first time in 84 years a briton has achieved the olympic middle-distance double. while holmes left athens as the star of team gb  it was radcliffe who carried expectations before the august games.  the 30-year-old marathon world record holder went into the athens event as favourite but an exhausted radcliffe dropped out after 23 miles in tears. her decision to enter the 10 000m five days later also backfired as she again pulled out with eight laps remaining.  but radcliffe helped put her olympic trauma behind her with a thrilling win in november s new york marathon. the 4x100m team grabbed some last-gasp glory for the british men s olympic squad after a poor start to the games.  it seemed as though athens would be the first games where the men would fail to win a medal with michael east the only individual track finalist in the 1500m. but darren campell  jason gardener  marlon devonish and mark lewis-francis made amends in the sprint relay. the quartet held off favourites the usa to win britain s first relay medal since 1912 in 38.07 seconds. gardener added the olympic relay crown to his world indoor title over 60m and  just like holmes  finally lived up to his promise in 2004. kelly sotherton completed team gb s athletics medal haul in athens with a surprise bronze in the heptathlon. the 28-year-old won her first championship medal since becoming a full-time athlete in 2003.  but it was a different story for britain s defending champion denise lewis  who withdrew on day two of the competition after some poor results. lewis  who was troubled by injury  has ruled out retiring while sotherton is tipped to build on her success. the athens olympics proved to be a landmark occasion for steve backley  who retired from competition after finishing fourth in the javelin. the battling 35-year-old leaves the sport with a vast medal haul including two silvers and one olympic bronze.  and backley s departure was balanced by the return of injury-hit decathlete dean macey  who came fourth in athens.  the continued improvement of sprinter abi oyepitan and long jumper chris tomlinson also boosted team gb. sadly  the 2004 olympics did not escape the problems of drugs misuse. on the eve of the games  greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou missed a drugs test and claimed to have been involved in a road crash.  kenteris  the 200m champion in 2000  and thanou have since been charged by the greek authorities and await trial. at the games  adrian annus (hammer)  robert fazelas (discus) and irina korzhanenko (shot) were all stripped of their titles because of doping issues. hungarian compatriots annus and fazelas both refused to give urine samples while russian korzhanenko tested positive for the steroid stanozolol.  the fallout from the thg scandal  which rocked the sport in 2003  continued to impact in olympic year. britain s 4x100m team took gold without the services of dwain chambers  who was handed a two-year ban in february after testing positive for steroid thg.  american kelli white was suspended and stripped of her world 100m and 200m titles after failing a drugs test. and world 400m champion jerome young landed a life ban from us chiefs after a second doping offence. russian pole vaulter yelena isinbayeva provided some light relief by smashing the world record seven times on her way to the world indoor and olympic titles. her rivalry with compatriot svetlana feofanova livened up the field events. morocco s hicham el guerrouj also delighted fans by racing to a historic olympic double in the 1500m and 5 000m.  and though there was no paula radcliffe in the london marathon  there was plenty of drama as kenyans evans rutto and margaret okayo took the titles. rutto held on to win despite slipping on some cobblestones and tumbling into a barrier. okayo also had to battle back after mistiming her tactics but clinched victory on her debut.,britain boost holm doubl athlet fan endur year mix emot stun victori go handinhand disappoint defeat drug scandal kelli holm final

154,2062,turkey deal  to help world peace  a deal bringing turkey a step closer to eu membership is of  fundamental importance  to the peace and security of the world  tony blair has said.  the deal  struck at the european council last week  also proved claims of a clash between muslims and christians were  wrong   mr blair said. it represented the achievement of an  historic british objective   he added. tory leader michael howard said the deal laid to rest any suggestion the eu was  anti-islamic .  turkey s involvement with the eu would provide an  invaluable bridge  between europe and the rest of the world  mr howard added. but the tory leader argued that the eu constitution was not designed to take in a country as large as turkey. mr blair has been a leading advocate of turkish membership despite controversy surrounding the idea. he insisted that the turkish leadership had made great advances in improving its human rights records. the deal to open formal talks with ankara came despite an eu demand for turkey to recognise cyprus.  it was agreed the issue can be tackled at a later date but turkish premier recep erdogan had to accept negotiations did not guarantee his country full eu membership. the internationally recognised southern part of cyprus is an eu member  but turkey  which occupies northern cyprus  had previously insisted it would not bow to demands to recognise the country  calling the issue a  red line . it could take up to 15 years before turkey is able to join  and entry cannot be guaranteed. if it joins  turkey may have to accept restrictions to limit migration by its citizens. the eu has also announced that it will start accession talks with croatia in april 2005. however  talks will begin only if the country co-operates fully with the un war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia.,turkey deal help world peac deal bring turkey step closer eu membership fundament import peac secur world toni blair say deal struck european council last week also prove claim clash muslim christian wrong mr blair say repres achiev histor british object ad torus leader michael howard say deal laid rest suggest eu antiislam turkey involv eu would provid invalu bridg europ rest world mr howard ad torus leader argu eu constitut design take countri larg turkey mr blair lead advoc turkish membership despit controversi surround idea insist turkish leadership make great advanc improv human right record deal open formal talk ankara come despit eu demand turkey recognis cypru agre issu tackl later date turkish premier recep erdogan accept negoti guarante countri full eu membership intern recognis southern part cypru eu member turkey occupi northern cypru previous insist would bow demand recognis countri call issu red line could take year turkey abl join entri guarante join turkey may accept restrict limit migrat citizen eu also announc start access talk croatia april howev talk begin countri cooper fulli un war crime tribun former yugoslavia
155,1034,labour s  eu propaganda  a  taxpayer subsidised propaganda exercise  on the eu is being used to lull the british public into a false sense of security  say the tories.  shadow foreign secretary michael ancram told mps a new white paper was part of trying to soften up opinion ahead of the referendum on the eu constitution. his claims were denied by foreign secretary jack straw  who accused the tories of  running scared  of debate. eu cooperation would help get better uk immigration controls  he argued.  mr straw used thursday s commons debate to launch the new white paper on the prospects for the eu in 2005. security  stability and prosperity would be the key themes when the uk took over the chairmanship of the eu in july  said mr straw. africa and climate change would also feature highly. he said the uk was trying to ensure future eu budgets were limited to 1% of europe s economic output and were spent  where it adds most value . mr straw promised to continue to ensure the uk s budget rebate  secured in 1984 by margaret thatcher  was  fully justified .  we  like all other countries  have a veto on any changes proposed in this area   he said.  mr ancram condemned the document  which the foreign office says has cost about £2 500 to design  print and deliver.  isn t the reason that the government is now involved in a taxpayer subsidised propaganda exercise to try to sell the new eu to the country in advance of the forthcoming referendum and general election    he asked. the tory spokesman also criticised the government for claiming the eu constitution would make europe easier to understand.  the government  last week  had to publish a commentary of 500 pages to try and explain this  easy and simple  constitution to the british people   he said.  who are they trying to kid   the proposed question for the constitution referendum is:  should the united kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the european union   the electoral commission on thursday said it was satisfied the question was easy to understand. the government has suggested the referendum on the constitution could take place in spring 2006  with the tories set to campaign for a  no  vote.  mr ancram said ministers were prolonging uncertainty by putting the vote off until the latest date possible. the foreign secretary hit back by saying tory attitudes to europe had helped keep the party out of power for more than a decade. mr straw argued cooperation with european partners could bring a  level playing field  on immigration and asylum controls.  you are setting your face against all of these things   he added. for the liberal democrats  sir menzies campbell said the uk should not ignore the need to reform the eu common agricultural policy. change was particularly important for developing countries wanting access to markets  he argued. sir menzies was among those worried about plans  backed by the uk  to lift the arms embargo imposed on china after the tiananmen square massacre. mr straw said no decisions had been taken - chinese human rights had improved but not by enough.,labour eu propaganda taxpay subsidis propaganda exercis eu use lull british public fals sen secur say torus shadow foreign secretari michael ancram told mp new white paper part tri soften opinion ahead referendum eu constitut claim deni foreign secretari jack straw accus torus run scare debat eu cooper would help get well uk immigr control argu mr straw use thursday common debat launch new white paper prospect eu secur stabil prosper would key theme uk take chairmanship eu juli say mr straw africa climat chang would also featur highli say uk tri ensur futur eu budget limit europ econom output spent add valu mr straw promis continu ensur uk budget rebat secur margaret thatcher fulli justifi like countri veto chang propos area say mr ancram condemn document foreign offic say cost £ design print deliv reason govern involv taxpay subsidis propaganda exercis tri sell new eu countri advanc forthcom referendum gener elect ask torus spokesman also criticis govern claim eu constitut would make europ easy understand govern last week publish commentari page tri explain easi simpl constitut british peopl say tri kid propos question constitut referendum unit kingdom approv treati establish constitut european union elector commiss thursday say satisfi question easi understand govern suggest referendum constitut could take place spring torus set campaign vote mr ancram say minist prolong uncertainti put vote late date possibl foreign secretari hit back say torus attitud europ help keep parti power decad mr straw argu cooper european partner could bring level play field immigr asylum control set face thing ad liber democrat sir menzi campbel say uk ignor need reform eu common agricultur polici chang particularli import develop countri want access market argu sir menzi among worri plan back uk lift arm embargo impos china tiananmen squar massacr mr straw say decis take chine human right improv enough

157,2088,cyber criminals step up the pace so-called phishing attacks that try to trick people into handing over confidential details have boomed in 2004  say security experts.  the number of phishing e-mail messages stopped by security firm messagelabs has risen more than tenfold in less than 12 months. in 2004 it detected more than 18 million phishing e-mail messages. other statistics show that in 2004 73% of all e-mail was spam and one in 16 messages were infected with a virus.  in its end-of-year report  messagelabs said that phishing had become the top security threat and most popular form of attack among cyber criminals. in september 2003  messagelabs caught only 273 phishing e-mails that tried to make people visit fake versions of the websites run by real banks and financial organisations. but by september 2004 it was stopping more than two million phishing related e-mail messages per month. worryingly  said the firm  phishing gangs were using increasingly sophisticated techniques to harvest useful information such as login details or personal data.  older attacks relied on users not spotting the fact that the site they were visiting was fake  but more recent phishing e-mails simply try to steal details as soon as a message is opened. other phishing scams try to recruit innocent people into acting as middlemen for laundering money or goods bought with stolen credit cards.  e-mail security attacks remain unabated in their persistence and ferocity   said mark sunner  chief technology officer at messagelabs.  in just 12 months phishing has firmly established itself as a threat to any organisation or individual conducting business online   he said. mr sunner said messagelabs was starting to see some phishing attacks become very focused on one company or organisation.  already particular businesses are threatened and blackmailed  indicating a shift from the random  scattergun approach  to customised attacks designed to take advantage of the perceived weaknesses of some businesses   he said. although phishing attacks grew substantially throughout 2004  viruses and spam remain popular with cyber-criminals and vandals. one of the biggest outbreaks took place in january when the mydoom virus started circulating. to date the company has caught more than 60 million copies of the virus. also up this year was the amount of spam in circulation. in 2003 only 40% of messages were spam. but by the end of 2004  almost three-quarters of messages were junk.,cyber crimin step pace socal phish attack tri trick peopl hand confidenti detail boom say secur expert number phish email messag stop secur firm messagelab risen tenfold less month detect million phish email messag statist show email spam one messag infect viru endofyear report messagelab say phish becom top secur threat popular form attack among cyber crimin septemb messagelab caught phish email tri make peopl visit fake version websit run real bank financi organis septemb stop two million phish relat email messag per month worryingli say firm phish gang use increasingli sophist techniqu harvest use inform login detail person data old attack reli user spot fact site visit fake recent phish email simpli tri steal detail soon messag open phish scam tri recruit innoc peopl act middleman launder money good bought steal credit card email secur attack remain unab persist feroc say mark sunner chief technolog offic messagelab month phish firmli establish threat organis individu conduct busi onlin say mr sunner say messagelab start see phish attack becom focus one compani organis alreadi particular busi threaten blackmail indic shift random scattergun approach customis attack design take advantag perceiv weak busi say although phish attack grow substanti throughout virus spam remain popular cybercrimin vandal one big outbreak take place januari mydoom viru start circul date compani caught million copi viru also year amount spam circul messag spam end almost threequart messag junk

160,1024,radcliffe tackles marathon tasks paula radcliffe faces arguably the biggest test of her career in the new york city marathon on sunday.  back under the spotlight of public scrutiny she will attempt to erase the double disappointment of the athens olympics  where she failed to finish the marathon and then the 10 000m. bbc sport examines the challenges facing radcliffe ahead of the big race.   the ability to run a gruelling 26.2 miles relies largely upon an athlete s belief that they can do it. every runner will hit the wall at some stage and see written on it   are you strong enough to finish    the question could hit radcliffe hard after she was unable to complete her last two races in high-profile and emotional circumstances. sports psychologist hugh richards says the 30-year-old must draw on her past achievements to conquer a potential crisis of confidence.  there is an old adage   get straight back on the horse that threw you    richards told bbc sport.  paula has got all those great runs in her history as well as the two upsets in athens.  she must not lose faith in what has already been proven is a very effective strategy for distance running.  if she were to change her preparation and tactics that would be madness.  she wants to start rebuilding her confidence through performance accomplishment.    for much of the watching media and public there can only be two possible outcomes in new york - win or lose. if radcliffe crosses the line first she will have proved her critics wrong. but if she fails to triumph  she risks being labelled a has-been and her profile will suffer. and for any athlete that can have repercussions in terms of sponsorship  appearance fees as well as further self esteem issues.   athletes need to try and stay focused on their internal controls and ignore external questions   explains richards  who has worked with past olympians.  she must not get caught up in someone else s agenda.  radcliffe s best friend and fellow distance runner liz yelling revealed the 30-year-old is already aware she will be exposing herself to more public scrutiny in new york.  she just thought   well  they can t think any worse of me now    yelling told bbc sport.  she s just doing what she wants to do and not thinking about the consequences of it.    radcliffe described her decision to enter the new york marathon as  impulsive  but she is certain to have a tick-list of personal goals. her aims could be as simple as completing a race and making sure she is still enjoying running but richards says she must avoid more emotional targets  such as redemption.  you can t change history   warned richards.  only one person can win the marathon but lots of people can be successful.  paula has to figure out what sort of things will she feel satisfied achieving by the end of the race.    the course from staten island to central park is renowned as one of the toughest in the world. it is also not the kind of fast course that tends to suit radcliffe better  with the undulating finish through the park testing the legs  final reserves.  radcliffe has never raced there before and will enter the unknown just 77 days after the athens marathon.  it s suggested after a major marathon you take a full month off and start building up again   said yelling  herself a marathon runner.  but that is only for long-term health and fitness.  when you finish a marathon you are still very fit and can recover quickly. so physically it is possible for paula.  richards also points out conditions in new york will be more conducive to a strong physical display from radcliffe.  the heat stress was the primary factor that tripped her up in athens   he said.  and that just isn t going to be there in new york  that s been taken out of the equation.      radcliffe concedes she will probably learn a lot from her bad experiences in athens in time. and richards and yelling agree she could turn the trauma to her advantage  starting in new york.  how you respond to adversity is what marks you out as elite or not   argues richards.   one of the challenges of massive set backs is how you turn them into opportunities.  and yelling says:  i think this will probably make paula.   i think it will drive her on and she ll come out of it a better athlete.,radcliff tackl marathon task paula radcliff face arguabl big test

162,957,web radio takes spanish rap global spin the radio dial in the us and you are likely to find plenty of spanish-language music. but what you will not find is much spanish-language hip-hop.  hip-hop and rap are actually quite popular in the spanish-speaking world  but local artists are having trouble marketing their work abroad. but now  a us company is bringing rap and hip-hop en espanol to computer users everywhere. los caballeros de plan g are one of mexico s hottest hip-hop acts. they have a devoted fan base in their native monterrey. but most mexican hip-hop fans  not to mention fans in most of the spanish-speaking world  rarely get a chance to hear the group s tracks on the radio.   you can t really just go on the radio and listen to hip-hop in spanish... it s just not accessible   says manuel millan  a native of san diego  california.  it s really hard for the spanish hip-hop scene to get into mainstream radio. you usually have a very commercialised sound and the groups are not really known around the country or around the world.  millan and two friends set out to change that - they wanted to make groups like los caballeros de plan g accessible to fans globally.  mainstream radio stations were not going to play this kind of music  and starting their own broadcast station was economically impossible. so  millan and his friends launched a website called latinohiphopradio.com. the name says it all: it is web-based radio  devoted to the hottest spanish language rap and hip-hop tracks. the site  which is in both in english and spanish  is meant to be easy to navigate. all the user has to do is download a media player. there are no djs. it is just music streamed over the net for free. suddenly  with the help of the website  los caballeros de plan g are producing  export quality  rap.  the web might be just the right medium for spanish language hip-hop right now. the genre is in what millan calls its  infant stage . but the production values are improving  and artists such as argentina s mustafa yoda are pushing to make it better and better. mustafa yoda is currently one of the hottest tracks on latinohiphopradio.com.  he s considered the eminem of argentina  and the latin american hip-hop scene   millan says.  he really hasn t had that much exposure as far as anywhere in the world  but he s definitely the one to look out for as far as becoming the next big thing in the spanish-speaking world.  currently  the chilean group makisa is also in latinohiphopradio.com s top 10  as is cuban artist papo record.  every country s got it s own cultural differences and they try to put those into their own songs   millan says. latinohiphopradio.com has been up and running for a couple of months now. the site has listeners from across the spanish speaking world. right now  mexico leads the way  accounting for about 50% of listeners. but web surfers in spain are logging in as well - about 25% of the web station s traffic comes from there. that is not surprising as many consider spain to be the leader in spanish-language rap and hip-hop. millan says that spain is actually just behind the united states and france in terms of overall rap and hip-hop production. that might be changing  though  as more and more latin american artists are finding audiences.  but one spaniard is still firmly in latinohiphopradio.com s top 10. his name is tote king and manuel millan says that he is the hip-hop leader in spain. on his track uno contra veinte emcees  or one against 20 emcees  tote king shows he is well aware of that fact.  it s basically him bragging that he s one of the best emcees in spain right now   millan says.  and it s pretty much true. he has the tightest productions  and his rap flow is impeccable  it s amazing.  latinohiphopradio.com is hoping to expand in the coming year. millan says they want to include more music and more news from the world of spanish language hip-hop and rap.  clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world  a bbc world service and wgbh-boston co-production.,web radio take spanish rap global spin radio dial u like find plenti spanishlanguag music find much spanishlanguag hiphop hiphop rap actual quit popular spanishspeak world local artist troubl market work abroad u compani bring rap hiphop en espanol comput user everywher lo caballero de plan g one mexico hottest hiphop act devot fan base nativ monterrey mexican hiphop fan mention fan spanishspeak world rare get chanc hear group track radio realli go radio listen hiphop spanish access say manuel millan nativ san diego california realli hard spanish hiphop scene get mainstream radio usual commercialis sound group realli know around countri around world millan two friend set chang want make group like lo caballero de plan g access fan global mainstream radio station go play kind music start broadcast station econom imposs millan friend launch websit call latinohiphopradiocom name say webbas radio devot hottest spanish languag rap hiphop track site english spanish meant easi navig user download medium player dj music stream net free suddenli help websit lo caballero de plan g produc export qualiti rap web might right medium spanish languag hiphop right genr millan call infant stage product valu improv artist argentina mustafa yoda push make well well mustafa yoda current one hottest track latinohiphopradiocom consid eminem argentina latin american hiphop scene millan say realli much exposur far anywher world definit one look far becom next big thing spanishspeak world current chilean group makisa also latinohiphopradiocom top cuban artist papo record everi countri get cultur differ tri put song millan say latinohiphopradiocom run coupl month site listen across spanish speak world right mexico lead way account listen web surfer spain log well web station traffic come surpris mani consid spain leader spanishlanguag rap hiphop millan say spain actual behind unit state franc term overal rap hiphop product might chang though latin american artist find audienc one spaniard still firmli latinohiphopradiocom top name tote king manuel millan say hiphop leader spain track uno contra veint emce one emce tote king show well awar fact basic brag one best emce spain right millan say pretti much true tightest product rap flow impecc amaz latinohiphopradiocom hope expand come year millan say want includ music news world spanish languag hiphop rap clark boyd technolog correspond world bbc world servic wgbhboston coproduct

179,1801,microsoft makes anti-piracy move microsoft says it is clamping down on people running pirated versions of its windows operating system by restricting their access to security features.  the windows genuine advantage scheme means people will have to prove their software is genuine from mid-2005. it will still allow those with unauthorised copies to get some crucial security fixes via automatic updates  but their options would be  limited . microsoft releases regular security updates to its software to protect pcs. either pcs detect updates automatically or users manually download fixes through microsoft s site. those running pirated windows programs would not have access to other downloads and  add-ons  that the software giant offers.  people who try to manually download security patches will have to let microsoft run an automated checking procedure on their computer or give an identification number.  microsoft s regular patches which it releases for newly-found security flaws are important because they stop worms  viruses and other threats penetrating pcs. some security experts are concerned that restricting access to such patches could mean a rise in such attacks and threats  with more pcs left unprotected. but graham cluley  senior consultant at security firm sophos  told the bbc news website that it was a positive decision.  it sounds like their decision to allow critical security patches to remain available to both legitimate and illegitimate users of windows is good news for everyone who uses the net   he said. windows genuine advantage was first introduced as a pilot scheme in september 2004 for english-language versions of windows.  microsoft s windows operating system is heavily exploited by virus writers because it is so widespread and they are constantly seeking out new security loopholes to take advantage of. the company is trying to tackle security threats whilst cracking down on pirated software at the same time. software piracy has cost the company billions  it says. the company announced earlier in january that it was releasing security tools to clean up pcs harbouring viruses and spyware  which 90% of pcs are infected with. the virus-fighting program  updated monthly  is a precursor to microsoft s dedicated anti-virus software. last year it introduced the windows xp counterfeit project  a uk-based pilot scheme  which ran from november to december. the scheme meant that anyone with pre-installed copies of the operating system in pcs bought before november could replace counterfeit versions of windows xp with legal ones for free. it is also increasing efforts to squash software piracy in china  norway and the czech republic  where pirated software is a huge problem  by offering discounts on legitimate software to users of pirated copies windows.  china in particular is a problem  with piracy estimated at 92%   said mr cluley.,microsoft make antipiraci move microsoft say clamp peopl run pirat version window oper system restrict access secur featur window genuin advantag scheme mean peopl prove softwar genuin mid still allow unauthoris copi get crucial secur fix via automat updat option would limit microsoft releas regular secur updat softwar protect pc either pc detect updat automat user manual download fix microsoft site run pirat window program would access download addon softwar giant offer peopl tri manual download secur patch let microsoft run autom check procedur comput give identif number microsoft regular patch releas newlyfound secur flaw import stop worm virus threat penetr pc secur expert concern restrict access patch could mean rise attack threat pc left unprotect graham cluley senior consult secur firm sopho told bbc news websit posit decis sound like decis allow critic secur patch remain avail legitim illegitim user window good news everyon use net say window genuin advantag first introduc pilot scheme septemb englishlanguag version window microsoft window oper system heavili exploit viru writer widespread constantli seek new secur loophol take advantag compani tri tackl secur threat whilst crack pirat softwar time softwar piraci cost compani billion say compani announc earlier januari releas secur tool clean pc harbour virus spywar pc infect virusfight program updat monthli precursor microsoft dedic antiviru softwar last year introduc window xp counterfeit project ukbas pilot scheme ran novemb decemb scheme meant anyon preinstal copi oper system pc bought novemb could replac counterfeit version window xp legal one free also increas effort squash softwar piraci china norway czech republ pirat softwar huge problem offer discount legitim softwar user pirat copi window china particular problem piraci estim say mr cluley

182,1434,when technology gets personal in 2020  whipping out your mobile phone to make a call will be quaintly pass&#233;. by then phones will be printed directly on to wrists  or other parts of the body  says ian pearson  bt s resident futurologist.  it s all part of what s known as a  pervasive ambient world   where  chips are everywhere . mr pearson does not have a crystal ball. his job is to formulate ideas based on what science and technology are doing now  to guide industries into the future. inanimate objects will start to interact with us: we will be surrounded - on streets  in homes  in appliances  on our bodies and possibly in our heads - by things that  think . forget local area networks - these will be body area networks. ideas about just how smart  small  or even invisible  technology will get are always floating around. images of devices clumsily bolted on to heads or wrists have pervaded thinking about future technology. but now a new vision is surfacing  where smart fabrics and textiles will be exploited to enhance functionality  form  or aesthetics. such materials are already starting to change how gadgets and electronics are used and designed.  so mp3 players - the mass gadget of the moment - will disappear and instead become integrated into one s clothing  says mr pearson.  so the gadgets that fill up your handbag  when we integrate those into fabric  we can actually get rid of all that stuff. you won t necessarily see the electronics.  wearable technology could exploit body heat to charge it up  while  video tattoos   or intelligent electronic contact lenses  might function as tv screens for those on the move. however  this future of highly personal devices  where technology is worn  or even fuses with the body itself  raises ethical questions. if technology is going to be increasingly part of clothing  jewellery  and skin  there needs to be some serious thinking about what it means for us as humans  says baroness susan greenfield. at a recent conference for technology  engineering  academic and fashion industry experts  at the royal society in london  neuroscientist baroness greenfield cautioned we  can t just sleepwalk into the future .  yet this technology is already upon us. researchers have developed computers and sensors worn in clothing. mp3 jackets  based on the idea that electrically conductive fabric can connect to keyboard sewn into sleeves  have already appeared in shops.  these  smart fabrics  have come about through advances in nano- and micro-engineering - the ability to manipulate and exploit materials at micro or molecular scale. at the nanoscale  materials can be  tuned  to display unusual properties that can be exploited to build faster  lighter  stronger and more efficient devices and systems. the textile and clothing industry has been one of the first to exploit nanotechnology in quite straightforward ways. many developments are appearing in real products in the fields of medicine  defence  healthcare  sports  and communications. professional swimming suits reduce drag by incorporating tiny structures similar to shark skin. nanoscale titanium dioxide (tio2) coatings give fabrics antibacterial and anti-odour properties. these have special properties which can be activated in contact with the air or uv light. such coatings have already been used to stop socks smelling for instance  to turn airline seats into super stain-resistant surfaces  and applied to windows so they clean themselves. dressings for wounds can now incorporate nanoparticles with biocidal properties and smart patches are being developed to deliver drugs through the skin. but baroness greenfield is concerned about how far this more personal contact with technology might affect our very being. if our clothing  skin  and  personal body networks  do the talking and the monitoring  everywhere we go  we have to think about what that means for our concept of privacy. mr pearson picks up the theme  pointing out there are a lot of issues humans have to iron out before we become  cyborgian . his main concern is  privacy .  we are looking at electronics which are really in deep contact with your body and a lot of that information you really don t want every passer-by to know.  so we have to make sure we build security in this. if you are wearing smart make-up  where electronics are controlling the appearance  you don t want people hacking in and writing messages on your forehead.  as technology infiltrates our biology  how will our brains function differently   we cannot arrogantly assume that the human brain will not change with this   warns baroness greenfield. there have already been successful experiments to grow human nerve cells on circuit boards. this paves the way for brain implants to help paralysed people interface directly with computers. clearly  the organic  carbon of our bodies and silicon is increasingly merging. the cyborg - a very familiar part-human  part-inorganic science fiction and academic idea - is on its way.,technolog get person whip mobil phone make call quaintli pas phone print directli wrist part bodi say ian pearson bt resid futurologist part know pervas ambient world chip everywher mr pearson crystal ball job formul idea base scienc technolog guid industri futur inanim object start interact u surround street home applianc bodi possibl head thing think forget local area network bodi area network idea smart small even invis technolog get alway float around imag devic clumsili bolt head wrist pervad think futur technolog new vision surfac smart fabric textil exploit enhanc function form aesthet materi alreadi start chang gadget electron use design mp player mass gadget moment disappear instead becom integr one cloth say mr pearson gadget fill handbag integr fabric actual get rid stuff necessarili see electron wearabl technolog could exploit bodi heat charg video tattoo intellig electron contact lens might function tv screen move howev futur highli person devic technolog worn even fuse bodi rais ethic question technolog go increasingli part cloth jewelleri skin need seriou think mean u human say baro susan greenfield recent confer technolog engin academ fashion industri expert royal societi london neuroscientist baro greenfield caution sleepwalk futur yet technolog alreadi upon u research develop comput sensor worn cloth mp jacket base idea electr conduct fabric connect keyboard sewn sleev alreadi appear shop smart fabric come advanc nano microengin abil manipul exploit materi micro molecular scale nanoscal materi tune display unusu properti exploit build faster lighter strong effici devic system textil cloth industri one first exploit nanotechnolog quit straightforward way mani develop appear real product field medicin defenc healthcar sport commun profession swim suit reduc drag incorpor tini structur similar shark skin nanoscal titanium dioxid tio coat give fabric antibacteri antiodour properti special properti activ contact air uv light coat alreadi use stop sock smell instanc turn airlin seat super stainresist surfac appli window clean dress wound incorpor nanoparticl biocid properti smart patch develop deliv drug skin baro greenfield concern far person contact technolog might affect cloth skin person bodi network talk monitor everywher go think mean concept privaci mr pearson pick theme point lot issu human iron becom cyborgian main concern privaci look electron realli deep contact bodi lot inform realli want everi passerbi know make sure build secur wear smart makeup electron control appear want peopl hack write messag forehead technolog infiltr biolog brain function differ arrogantli assum human brain chang warn baro greenfield alreadi success experi grow human nerv cell circuit board pave way brain implant help paralys peopl interfac directli comput clearli organ carbon bodi silicon increasingli merg cyborg familiar parthuman partinorgan scienc fiction academ idea way
183,390,will tory tax cuts lift spirits  michael howard has finally revealed the full scale of his planned tory tax cuts.  should he win the next general election  he has earmarked £4 billion that will be used to reduce taxes - although he still will not say which or how. this was the pre-election message many in his party have been pressing for and voters  he believes  will warm to. at its simplest  it is saying:  vote tory and you can have it both ways . not only would his government stick to labour spending plans on core public services  including health and education  it would increase spending on defence  police and pensions. and even after that was done  it would still have enough left over for a tax cut equivalent to about a penny off the basic rate of income tax.  all the money would come from its £35 billion efficiency savings which would see the axe taken to bureaucracy  waste and the civil service. of that  £23 billion would go on spending plans  with £8 billion to fill the black hole left  they claim  by gordon brown  and the rest going in tax cuts.  neither mr howard nor mr letwin would say exactly how they would use that cash  although a cut in the basic rate seems unlikely. ideas already floated include raising tax thresholds and abolishing or reducing inheritance tax  although some in the tory party are urging mr howard to announce something more eye-catching before the election. as the tory leader declared  the aim of the exercise is to open up a real economic policy divide between labour and the tories.  at this election  people will have a clear choice between mr blair who will waste more and tax more and the conservative party which will give value for money and tax less   he said.  it is a move back towards an almost traditional tory message which previously suggested labour was the party of tax rises and the conservatives the party of tax cuts.  the extension of that  however  was that labour was also seen as the party of big spending on the public services while the tories were the cutters. and that is where one of the problems lies for mr howard - can he persuade sceptical voters that they really can have it both ways with bigger spending on public services and lower taxes  he insists he will not promise anything before the election that he cannot deliver if put into downing street. labour  needless to say  claim his planned £35bn efficiency savings simply don t add up and that those sorts of figures are fantasy.  one of new labour s greatest successes before the historic 1997 election was to persuade voters  business and the city that it could be trusted to run the economy. so far that has not faced any real challenge  but independent analysts now claim a third new labour government would be forced to either increase taxation or taxes to plug a black hole it has at the centre of its finances. meanwhile  the liberal democrats are committed to increasing taxes for the most well off to finance their spending proposals launched earlier in the day. so  mr howard hopes his message will start to hit home during this unofficial election campaign and that his poll ratings might finally lift off the floor. and  while other issues like the iraq war and trust will play a major part in that campaign  it is likely - and the prime minister probably hopes - that the economy will be the deciding factor.,torus tax cut lift spirit michael howard final reveal full scale plan torus tax cut win next gener elect earmark £ billion use reduc tax although still say preelect messag mani parti press voter believ warm simplest say vote torus way would govern stick labour spend plan core public servic includ health educ would increas spend defenc polic pension even do would still enough left tax cut equival penni basic rate incom tax money would come £ billion effici save would see axe take bureaucraci wast civil servic £ billion would go spend plan £ billion fill black hole left claim gordon brown rest go tax cut neither mr howard mr letwin would say exactli would use cash although cut basic rate seem unlik idea alreadi float includ rais tax threshold abolish reduc inherit tax although torus parti urg mr howard announc someth eyecatch elect torus leader declar aim exercis open real econom polici divid labour torus elect peopl clear choic mr blair wast tax conserv parti give valu money tax less say move back toward almost tradit torus messag previous suggest labour parti tax rise conserv parti tax cut extens howev labour also see parti big spend public servic torus cutter one problem lie mr howard persuad sceptic voter realli way big spend public servic low tax insist promis anyth elect deliv put down street labour needle say claim plan £bn effici save simpli add sort figur fantasi one new labour great success histor elect persuad voter busi citi could trust run economi far face real challeng independ analyst claim third new labour govern would forc either increas taxat tax plug black hole centr financ meanwhil liber democrat commit increas tax well financ spend propos launch earlier day mr howard hope messag start hit home unoffici elect campaign poll rate might final lift floor issu like iraq war trust play major part campaign like prime minist probabl hope economi decid factor

185,1253,blinx sequel purrs nicely the original blinx was intended to convert many platform game lovers to microsoft s then new xbox console.  its sharp graphics and novel gameplay  with the main character able to pause  slow  rewind and fast-forward time  were meant to lure many fans to the new machine. but poor design meant the game became a very frustrating affair with players often stranded half-way through a level without the required tools to finish. thankfully  the sequel has fixed many of the original faults. this time around you do not play as blinx but instead you are given the chance to create two unique cat characters and two pig characters.  the character generator is very detailed and a few minutes of tweaking and adjusting will create a unique personality to unleash on the game.  as the game progresses you swap between the two rival factions  pig and feline  assuming the role of your created characters. the thrust of the game sees the two factions competing to recover pieces of a missing time crystal. as in the original  your feline persona can control time  but this time the pigs get to control space. there are a number of puzzles which require control over time to solve while the pigs can create things such as warps  space bubbles and void traps in order to progress. the control over space and time is achieved through a number of vcr-style icons and is quite intuitive.  annoyingly  the puzzles are a little too obviously flagged up and most gamers will find it more of a chore than a challenge to solve them. the game has also tried to emulate franchises such as jak and daxter and ratchet and clank on ps2 and so there are a number of combat elements. these are a little predictable and tend to drag the general polish of the game down to a more dulled affair. but the game s excellent graphics  easily the best-looking platform game around  sound and dollops of humour make it an attractive game for younger platform fans.  blinx 2 is out on xbox now.,blinx sequel purr nice origin blinx intend convert mani platform game lover microsoft new xbox consol sharp graphic novel gameplay main charact abl paus slow rewind fastforward time meant lure mani fan new machin poor design meant game becam frustrat affair player often strand halfway level without requir tool finish thank sequel fix mani origin fault time around play blinx instead give chanc creat two uniqu cat charact two pig charact charact gener detail minut tweak adjust creat uniqu person unleash game game progress swap two rival faction pig felin assum role creat charact thrust game see two faction compet recov piec miss time crystal origin felin persona control time time pig get control space number puzzl requir control time solv pig creat thing warp space bubbl void trap order progress control space time achiev number vcrstyle icon quit intuit annoyingli puzzl littl obvious flag gamer find chore challeng solv game also tri emul franchis jak daxter ratchet clank p number combat element littl predict tend drag gener polish game dull affair game excel graphic easili bestlook platform game around sound dollop humour make attract game young platform fan blinx xbox

189,327,consumers drive french economy france s economic growth accelerated in the last three months of 2004  driven by consumer spending  a report shows.  gross domestic product (gdp) rose by 0.8% in the fourth quarter compared with the previous three month period  the statistical office insee said. that expansion pushed annual growth to 2.3%  the fastest rate in two years. consumer spending was up by 1.2% in the fourth quarter  and there also was a rebound in business investment that gave the recovery an extra shove.  analysts warned that france still was facing challenges and was unlikely to keep expanding at its current pace.   france still has a strong economic growth   said marc toutai  an economist at natexis banques populaires.  but  if we check the figures in detail  there s a problem.   consumer spending is still high. but french households have spent their savings to consume.  france can t sustain a high growth rate without an improvement in the job market. there s too much of a gap between growth and employment.  unemployment levels are currently stuck at about 10%  and is proving difficult to bring down despite government efforts. another worry is that demand in germany and italy  two of france s main trading partners  is sluggish.  despite the concerns  analysts pointed out that france was outperforming the majority of its european counterparts and that its economy was looking more robust than in previous years. as well as strong domestic demand  exports climbed by 1.3% in the fourth quarter - the biggest increase in foreign sales for a year.  it s an economic growth that seems well balanced   said nicolas claquin  an analyst at ccf.  in the beginning of 2004  growth was mainly driven by consumer spending. here it gets contributions from investment and exports  though household consumption is still strong.  but we expect overall economic growth to fall to 2.0 percent in 2005.,consum drive french economi franc econom growth acceler last three month driven consum spend report show gross domest product gdp rise fourth quarter compar previou three month period statist offic inse say expans push annual growth fast rate two year consum spend fourth quarter also rebound busi invest give recoveri extra shove analyst warn franc still face challeng unlik keep expand current pace franc still strong econom growth say marc toutai economist natexi banqu populair check figur detail problem consum spend still high french household spent save consum franc sustain high growth rate without improv job market much gap growth employ unemploy level current stuck prove difficult bring despit govern effort anoth worri demand germani itali two franc main trade partner sluggish despit concern analyst point franc outperform major european counterpart economi look robust previou year well strong domest demand export climb fourth quarter big increas foreign sale year econom growth seem well balanc say nicola claquin analyst ccf begin growth mainli driven consum spend get contribut invest export though household consumpt still strong expect overal econom growth fall percent

191,549,lib dems unveil women s manifesto the liberal democrats are attempting to woo female voters with the launch of their manifesto for women.  charles kennedy is pledging a maternity income guarantee and a pension system based on years of residence rather than national insurance payments. he also thinks women will back plans to end university tuition fees and for free long-term care for the elderly. both labour and the conservatives have said they also plan to boost pensions and to improve childcare support. mr kennedy says he wants to deal with policy areas that disadvantage women.  two million pensioners in britain currently live below the government s own poverty line - two-thirds of whom are women   he said.  he says that pensions based on the number of years worked ignore the contribution women make caring for children. the lib dem s citizen s pension  based on length of residency not on national insurance contributions  would address that imbalance  mr kennedy argues. under the package  new mothers would be offered minimum guaranteed maternity pay of £170 a week for the first six months after the birth of their first child. mr kennedy also believes the party s plans to use the money saved from not introducing  illiberal  id cards to boost police numbers by 10 000 would appeal to women too. the policies are not new announcements  but the way they are structured as a package to appeal to women is.  mr kennedy also points to the fact that 40% of the party s candidates set to stand in winnable or target seats are women. party strategists claim that where women candidates replace men turnout rises by 4%. mr kennedy began the pitch for female support with an interview on bbc radio 4 s women s hour on monday. during the interview mr kennedy revealed that he planned to structure the party s general election campaign around the birth of his first child  which is expected in april. the baby and his wife sarah would be  priority number one  even if it arrived in the middle of the election campaign  he said.  party strategists believe winning over a significant proportion of women voters is key to electoral success. a party spokesman said it was courting female votes because they tended to vote more than men and are believed to be more considered and open-minded in deciding who they vote for. labour s deputy minister for women jacqui smith accused the lib dems of offering  false promises  to women and said their sums did not add up. she said:  these proposals would increase the costs to the public purse drastically year on year  and hard working families will pay dearly  through either increased taxes or reduced spending on public services . the labour party has committed itself to  universal  affordable and flexible  childcare for parents of all 3 to 14 year-olds  including childcare centred on schools to be available from 8am to 6pm. in september  trade and industry secretary patricia hewitt said she would like to see longer paid maternity leave  higher paternity pay and the extension of flexible working rights to carers  if labour won a third term. the conservatives are yet to unveil their manifesto plans for childcare but said in november they would increase maternity pay and pay the child tax credit in cash to parents to spend as they like  on a nanny  au pair or even a family member  such as a grandparent  acting as a carer. they were also consulting on making childcare costs tax deductible.,lib dem unveil woman manifesto liber democrat attempt woo femal voter launch manifesto woman charl kennedi pledg matern incom guarante pension system base year resid rather nation insur payment also think woman back plan end univers tuition fee free longterm care elderli labour conserv say also plan boost pension improv childcar support mr kennedi say want deal polici area disadvantag woman two million pension britain current live govern poverti line twothird woman say say pension base number year work ignor contribut woman make care child lib dem citizen pension base length resid nation insur contribut would address imbal mr kennedi argu packag new mother would offer minimum guarante matern pay £ week first six month birth first child mr kennedi also believ parti plan use money save introduc illiber id card boost polic number would appeal woman polici new announc way structur packag appeal woman mr kennedi also point fact parti candid set stand winnabl target seat woman parti strategist claim woman candid replac men turnout rise mr kennedi begin pitch femal support interview bbc radio woman hour monday interview mr kennedi reveal plan structur parti gener elect campaign around birth first child expect april babi wife sarah would prioriti number one even arriv middl elect campaign say parti strategist believ win signific proport woman voter key elector success parti spokesman say court femal vote tend vote men believ consid openmind decid vote labour deputi minist woman jacqui smith accus lib dem offer fals promis woman say sum add say propos would increas cost public purs drastic year year hard work famili pay dearli either increas tax reduc spend public servic labour parti commit univers afford flexibl childcar parent yearold includ childcar centr school avail be pm septemb trade industri secretari patricia hewitt say would like see longer paid matern leav high patern pay extens flexibl work right carer labour third term conserv yet unveil manifesto plan childcar say novemb would increas matern pay pay child tax credit cash parent spend like nanni au pair even famili member grandpar act carer also consult make childcar cost tax deduct

194,184,xbox power cable  fire fear  microsoft has said it will replace more than 14 million power cables for its xbox consoles due to safety concerns.  the company said the move was a  preventative step  after reports of fire hazard problems with the cables. it affects xboxes made before 23 october 2003 for all regions but mainland europe - and consoles in that region made before 13 january 2004. microsoft said it had received 30 reports of minor injury or property damage due to faulty cables. the firm said fewer than one in 10 000 consoles had experienced component failures. the recall affects almost three quarters of all xboxes sold around the world since its launch in 2001.  in a statement  it added:  in almost all instances  any damage caused by these failures was contained within the console itself or limited to the tip of the power cord at the back of the console.  but in seven cases  customers reported sustaining a minor burn to their hand. in 23 cases  customers reported smoke damage  or minor damage to a carpet or entertainment centre.  this is a preventative step we re choosing to take despite the rarity of these incidents   said robbie bach  senior vice president  microsoft home and entertainment division.  we regret the inconvenience  but believe offering consumers a free replacement cord is the responsible thing to do.  consumers can order a new cable from the xbox website or by telephoning 0800 028 9276 in the uk. microsoft said customers would get replacement cords within two to four weeks from the time of order. it advised users to turn off their xboxes when not in use. a follow-up to xbox is expected to released at the end of this year or the beginning of 2006.,xbox power cabl fire fear microsoft say replac million power cabl xbox consol due safeti concern compani say move prevent step report fire hazard problem cabl affect xbox make octob region mainland europ consol region make januari microsoft say receiv report minor injuri properti damag due faulti cabl firm say few one consol experienc compon failur recal affect almost three quarter xbox sell around world sinc launch statement ad almost instanc damag caus failur contain within consol limit tip power cord back consol seven case custom report sustain minor burn hand case custom report smoke damag minor damag carpet entertain centr prevent step choos take despit rariti incid say robbi bach senior vice presid microsoft home entertain divis regret inconveni believ offer consum free replac cord respons thing consum order new cabl xbox websit telephon uk microsoft say custom would get replac cord within two four week time order advis user turn xbox use followup xbox expect releas end year begin

196,280,paris promise raises welsh hopes has there been a better six nations match than saturday s epic in paris   and can the welsh revival continue all the way to a first grand slam since 1978  those are the two questions occupying not just wales supporters but rugby fans as a whole after a scintillating display in paris. welsh legend mervyn davies  a member of two of three grand slam-winning sides of the 1970s  hailed it as  one of the great performances of the past three decades . martyn williams  wales  two-try scorer on the day  called it  one of the most surreal games i have ever played in . a crestfallen france coach  bernard laporte  simply observed:  there was a french half and there was a welsh half . and what a half it was for the red dragonhood  transforming a 15-6 half-time deficit into an 18-15 lead within five mesmerising minutes of the second period. but while that passage of play showed the swelling self-belief of a side prepared to back its own spirit of adventure  the final quarter told us a whole lot more about this welsh side. that they recovered from a battering in the first half-hour to first stem the tide before half-time  then reverse it on the resumption  was remarkable enough. but in resisting a seemingly unstoppable wave of french pressure in a nail-biting final five minutes  wales showed not only their physical attributes but their mental resolve.  in international rugby  any of the top seven sides can beat each other on a given day  but the great sides are those that win the close contests on a consistent basis. england suffered some infamous six nations disappointments en route to world cup glory  the pain of defeat forging bonds that ultimately led to victory when it really mattered. wales have some way to go before they can be remotely considered in a similar light. but the signs are that players previously on the receiving end are learning how to emerge on the right side of the scoreline. ten of the 22 on duty on saturday were also involved when wales were trounced 33-5 in paris two years ago. but since they threw off the shackles against new zealand in the 2003 world cup  wales have rediscovered much of what made them a great rugby nation in the first place.   the confidence in the squad has been building and building since the world cup and we now have young players who are becoming world class   noted coach mike ruddock. the likes of michael owen  gethin jenkins  dwayne peel and gavin henson are certainly building strong cases for inclusion on this summer s lions tour to new zealand. and players like stephen jones  martyn williams  shane williams and gareth thomas are proving it is not only the youngsters that are on an upward curve. jones  after his superb man-of-the-match display  observed that  we are a very happy camp now . ruddock and thomas can take much of the credit for that  ensuring the tribal and regional divisions that have often scarred welsh rugby do not extend to the national squad. the  joie de vivre  so evident in that magical second-half spell in paris also stems from a style of play that first wooed supporters the world over in the 1970s.  if england had half the innate attacking exuberance wales have produced in this championship  they would not be contemplating the debris of three consecutive defeats. similarly  wales have learnt that style alone does not win matches  and that forward power  mental toughness and good decision-making under pressure are equally important. so on to murrayfield  where wales have not won on their last three visits. while the hype in the principality will go into overdrive  the players will set about the task of beating scotland. only then - with the visit of ireland to finish - can they start thinking about emulating the hallowed players of the 1970s  and writing their own names into welsh legend.,pari promis rais welsh hope well six nation match saturday epic pari welsh reviv continu way first grand slam sinc two question occupi wale support rugbi fan whole scintil display pari welsh legend mervyn davi member two three grand slamwin side s hail one great perform past three decad martyn william wale twotri scorer day call one surreal game ever play crestfallen franc coach bernard laport simpli observ french half welsh half half red dragonhood transform halftim deficit lead within five mesmeris minut second period passag play show swell selfbelief side prepar back spirit adventur final quarter told u whole lot welsh side recov batter first halfhour first stem tide halftim revers resumpt remark enough resist seemingli unstopp wave french pressur nailbit final five minut wale show physic attribut mental resolv intern rugbi top seven side beat give day great side win close contest consist basi england suffer infam six nation disappoint en rout world cup glori pain defeat forg bond ultim lead victori realli matter wale way go remot consid similar light sign player previous receiv end learn emerg right side scorelin ten duti saturday also involv wale trounc pari two year ago sinc threw shackl new zealand world cup wale rediscov much make great rugbi nation first place confid squad build build sinc world cup young player becom world class note coach mike ruddock like michael owen gethin jenkin dwayn peel gavin henson certainli build strong case inclus summer lion tour new zealand player like stephen jone martyn william shane william gareth thoma prove youngster upward curv jone superb manofthematch display observ happi camp ruddock thoma take much credit ensur tribal region divis often scar welsh rugbi extend nation squad joie de vivr evid magic secondhalf spell pari also stem style play first woo support world s england half innat attack exuber wale produc championship would contempl debri three consecut defeat similarli wale learnt style alon win match forward power mental tough good decisionmak pressur equal import murrayfield wale last three visit hype princip go overdr player set task beat scotland visit ireland finish start think emul hallow player s write name welsh legend
197,217,actor scott is new bond favourite bookmaker william hill has stopped taking bets on who will be the next james bond  following a succession of large wagers on actor dougray scott.  the firm closed the book on friday  saying  insider information  could have contributed to the number of bets.  in the past gambles like this have often been right   william hill spokesman rupert adams said. the closing list gave scott odds of 6-9  followed by oscar nominee clive owen at 5-2. scott first found fame in the tv series soldier soldier and has since then starred in such films as mission impossible ii and the wartime drama enigma.  mr adams said one punter had placed a bet of £870 on the 39-year-old actor at odds of 8-1.  she told us she had some inside information  perhaps she knew he had been to a casting  but she wouldn t say   he said. others thought to be in the running include star wars actor ewan mcgregor and australian star hugh jackman  both of whom have odds of 4-1. colin farrell  jude law and troy star eric bana have also been tipped for the role in the past.  a large number of bets on actor colin salmon to become the first black james bond were dismissed as a publicity stunt a month ago. the next bond film  originally due for release in 2005  has been delayed until 2006 due to sony s takeover of the mgm studio. the most recent  die another day  was released in late 2002 and saw pierce brosnan make his final appearance as the secret agent. the actor was originally due to make a fifth appearance as bond  but was released from his contract in 2004.,actor scott new bond favourit bookmak william hill stop take bet next jame bond follow success larg wager actor dougray scott firm close book friday say insid inform could contribut number bet past gambl like often right william hill spokesman rupert adam say close list give scott odd follow oscar nomine clive owen scott first found fame tv seri soldier soldier sinc star film mission imposs ii wartim drama enigma mr adam say one punter place bet £ yearold actor odd told u insid inform perhap knew cast say say other thought run includ star war actor ewan mcgregor australian star hugh jackman odd colin farrel jude law troy star eric bana also tip role past larg number bet actor colin salmon becom first black jame bond dismiss public stunt month ago next bond film origin due releas delay due soni takeov mgm studio recent die anoth day releas late saw pierc brosnan make final appear secret agent actor origin due make fifth appear bond releas contract

199,292,freeze on anti-spam campaign a campaign by lycos europe to target spam-related websites appears to have been put on hold.  earlier this week the company released a screensaver that bombarded the sites with data to try to bump up the running costs of the websites. but the site hosting the screensaver now displays a pink graphic and the words  stay tuned . no one at lycos was available for comment on latest developments in its controversial anti-spam campaign.  lycos europe s  make love not spam  campaign was intended as a way for users to fight back against the mountain of junk mail flooding inboxes. people were encouraged to download the screensaver which  when their pc was idle  would then send lots of data to sites that peddle the goods and services mentioned in spam messages. lycos said the idea was to get the spam sites running at 95% capacity and generate big bandwidth bills for the spammers behind the sites. but the plan has proved controversial.  monitoring firm netcraft analysed response times for some of the sites targeted by the screensaver and found that a number were completely knocked offline.  the downing of the sites could dent lycos claims that what it is doing does not amount to a distributed denial of service attack. in such attacks thousands of computers bombard sites with data in an attempt to overwhelm them. laws in many countries do not explicitly outlaw such attacks but many nations are re-drafting computer use laws to make them specific offences. lycos europe now appears to have put the plan on hold. the site hosting the screensaver currently shows a holding page  with the words   stay tuned . the numerical internet address of the site has also changed. this is likely to be in response to spammers who have reportedly redirected traffic from their sites back to the lycos screensaver site. the campaign has come under fire from some corners of the web. many discussion groups have said that it set a dangerous precedent and could incite vigilantism.  attacking a spammer s website is like poking a grizzly bear sleeping in your back garden with a pointy stick   said graham cluley  senior technology consultant for sophos.  not only is this screensaver similar in its approach to a potentially illegal distributed denial of service attack  but it also is in danger of turning innocent computer users into vigilantes  who may not be prepared for whatever retaliation the spammers care to dream up.,freez antispam campaign campaign lyco europ target spamrel websit appear put hold earlier week compani releas screensav bombard site data tri bump run cost websit site host screensav display pink graphic word stay tune one lyco avail comment late develop controversi antispam campaign lyco europ make love spam campaign intend way user fight back mountain junk mail flood inbox peopl encourag download screensav pc idl would send lot data site peddl good servic mention spam messag lyco say idea get spam site run capac gener big bandwidth bill spammer behind site plan prove controversi monitor firm netcraft analys respons time site target screensav found number complet knock offlin down site could dent lyco claim amount distribut denial servic attack attack thousand comput bombard site data attempt overwhelm law mani countri explicitli outlaw attack mani nation redraft comput use law make specif offenc lyco europ appear put plan hold site host screensav current show hold page word stay tune numer internet address site also chang like respons spammer reportedli redirect traffic site back lyco screensav site campaign come fire corner web mani discus group say set danger preced could incit vigilant attack spammer websit like poke grizzli bear sleep back garden pointi stick say graham cluley senior technolog consult sopho screensav similar approach potenti illeg distribut denial servic attack also danger turn innoc comput user vigilant may prepar whatev retali spammer care dream
200,731,eu software patent law delayed controversial new eu rules for the patenting of computer-based inventions have been put on hold due to a last minute intervention from poland.  poland - a large and therefore crucial eu member - has requested more time to consider the issue  especially as it relates to the patenting of software. critics say the law would favour large companies over small  innovative ones. they say it could have massive ramifications for developments such as open source software.  polish ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions changed so that it excludes the patenting of software. the planned law has ignited angry debate about whether the eu should allow the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods as currently happens in the us. so  for instance  us-based amazon.com holds a patent on  one-click shopping . critics claim the law  which the eu says is needed to harmonise with the us  is little more than a law on ideas.  patent rights  it is claimed  protect inventors but in this case it is exclusively the interests of the big companies that are protected   eva lichtenberg  a austrian green member of the european parliament said in a statement.  smaller  innovative firms cannot afford the patenting and legal costs that the directive would inflict on them   she added. the european parliament has already clashed with the european union on the issue and there have been accusations that the process to decide the issue has been undemocratic. the directive has been subject to several previous delays.,eu softwar patent law delay controversi new eu rule patent computerbas invent put hold due last minut intervent poland poland larg therefor crucial eu member request time consid issu especi relat patent softwar critic say law would favour larg compani small innov one say could massiv ramif develop open sourc softwar polish minist want see phrase text direct patent computerimpl invent chang exclud patent softwar plan law ignit angri debat whether eu allow patent comput program internet busi method current happen u instanc usbas amazoncom hold patent oneclick shop critic claim law eu say need harmonis u littl law idea patent right claim protect inventor case exclus interest big compani protect eva lichtenberg austrian green member european parliament say statement small innov firm afford patent legal cost direct would inflict ad european parliament alreadi clash european union issu accus process decid issu undemocrat direct subject sever previou delay
201,219,new rules tackle  sham weddings  new rules on marriage for foreign nationals living in the uk are coming into force.  from tuesday  most non-eu citizens will need home office approval to marry. the home office says the new rules are aimed at reducing the number of sham marriages  of which there are estimated to be up to 15 000 a year. but immigrants  group the joint council for the welfare of immigrants (jcwi) says the rules breach human rights law and it may mount a legal challenge. when the changes were unveiled last year  immigration minister des browne said:  our aim is to avoid unnecessary disruption of genuine marriages  while providing firm controls to prevent abuse.  under the previous regulations anybody wishing to get married in the uk only had to produce evidence they had been resident in the country for a week and give 15 days notice of the wedding at the local register office.  but from tuesday all non-eu nationals  apart from citizens of switzerland  liechtenstein  iceland or norway  intending to wed in the uk must either obtain a visa allowing them to get married before they enter the country or apply for a home office  certificate of marriage approval . to get a certificate  costing £135  applicants will have to send proof that they have a legal right to be in the uk. those without a settled status  such as asylum seekers awaiting a decision on their application  will have no right to marry in the uk.  once they have the necessary documentation  those subject to immigration controls wishing to get married in england or wales must register their intention to marry at one of 76 specially-designated register offices. they can  however  marry at the register office or church of their choice. rhian beynon of the jcwi said the new rules were  not proportionate  and  discriminatory .   these rules means in some cases the home secretary is going to be a marriage registrar of last resort.  we re currently taking a legal opinion on this. we ll be looking for people whose right to marry is breached and we ll be looking at taking a case on this to the human rights court   ms beynon said. the new rules have also been called into question by the parliamentary joint committee on human rights. in a report published last july the cross-party committee stated there was a  significant risk  the new procedures were incompatible with the right to marry because they introduced restrictions which were  disproportionate . the committee believed the new laws might be incompatible with the human rights act on the grounds of religion  belief and nationality  the report added.  over the last year immigration service operations against marriages of convenience have been stepped up resulting in a growing number of convictions. in january 25 people who took part in a sham marriage network based in leicester were jailed for a total of 35 years. and last november samuel amoah  a belgian national who set up two sham weddings for couples who wanted to remain in the uk  was jailed for three years. several other cases are currently going through the courts. the role of registrars who under the asylum and immigration act 1999 were obliged to report suspected sham marriages to the home office  has been key in many prosecutions. registrars  spokesman  mark rimmer  said they welcomed the new marriage regulations and believed they would be an significant deterrent.  they will effectively remove most of the blatant cases. certainly those who are illegals in this country  of which we had quite a few  will no longer be getting married   mr rimmer said. mr rimmer  the service director for registrations of marriages at brent council in north-west london  said he did not consider the new law to be an infringement of civil liberties.  it may be seen to be far more draconian than it has been but certainly it s still not as difficult to marry in the uk than it is to marry  for example  in holland  germany or france.  i think it s a proportionate response by government to what was a very large problem   mr rimmer said.,new rule tackl sham wed new rule marriag foreign nation live uk come forc tuesday noneu citizen

202,528,bank payout to pinochet victims a us bank has said it will donate more than $8m to victims of former chilean military ruler augusto pinochet s regime under a madrid court settlement.  riggs bank will put money in a special fund to be managed by a madrid-based charity  the salvador allende foundation  which helps abused victims. the bank had been accused of illegally concealing gen pinochet s assets. more than 3 000 people were killed for political reasons under gen pinochet s regime  an official report says. last month in a us court  riggs bank pleaded guilty to failing to report suspicious activity relating to accounts held by gen pinochet and the government of equatorial guinea. on that occasion  it was ordered to pay a fine of $16m. gen pinochet himself has never been put on trial for human rights violations under his 1973-90 rule  despite several high-profile cases against him. he is now facing charges relating to the murder of one chilean and the disappearance of nine others. he is also being investigated for tax evasion  tax fraud and embezzlement of state funds.  the general s opponents rejoiced at the settlement  which was agreed in a court in the spanish capital  madrid. a lawyer for the victims  eduardo contreras  told reuters news agency:  this demonstrates that the horrors of the pinochet dictatorship are not a mystery to anyone and that the whole world knows his victims deserve reparations.  riggs spokesman mark hendrix said the settlement  details of which will be announced next week  was an opportunity to move on.  this enables the institution to put the matter behind us   he told reuters. the settlement follows a legal complaint filed against the bank by spanish judge baltasar garzon alleging that it had illegally concealed assets. the bank agreed to create a fund for the victims  but the charges were dropped.,bank payout pinochet victim u bank say donat m victim former chilean militari ruler augusto pinochet regim madrid court settlement rigg bank put money special fund manag madridbas chariti salvador allend foundat help abus victim bank accus illeg conceal gen pinochet asset peopl kill polit reason gen pinochet regim offici report say last month u court rigg bank plead guilti fail report suspici activ relat account held gen pinochet govern equatori guinea occas order pay fine m gen pinochet never put trial human right violat rule despit sever highprofil case face charg relat murder one chilean disappear nine other also investig tax evas tax fraud embezzl state fund gener oppon rejoic settlement agre court spanish capit madrid lawyer victim eduardo contrera told reuter news agenc demonstr horror pinochet dictatorship mysteri anyon whole world know victim deserv repar rigg spokesman mark hendrix say settlement detail announc next week opportun move enabl institut put matter behind u told reuter settlement follow legal complaint file bank spanish judg baltasar garzon alleg illeg conceal asset bank agre creat fund victim charg drop

208,194,french suitor holds lse meeting european stock market euronext has met with the london stock exchange (lse) amid speculation that it may be ready to launch a cash bid.  euronext chief jean-francois theodore held talks with lse boss clara furse the day after rival deutsche boerse put forward its own bid case. the german exchange said it had held  constructive  professional and friendly  talks with the lse. but euronext declined to comment after the talks ended on friday. speculation is mounting that the germans may raise their bid to £1.5bn. deutsche boerse previously offered £1.3bn  which was rejected by the lse  while euronext is rumoured to have facilities in place to fund a £1.4bn cash bid. so far  however  neither have tabled a formal bid. but a deal with either bidder would create the biggest stock market operator in europe and the second biggest in the world after the new york stock exchange.  there was speculation euronext would use friday s meeting as an opportunity to take advantage of growing disquiet over deutsche boerse s own plans for dominance over the london market. unions for deutsche boerse staff in frankfurt has reportedly expressed fears that up to 300 jobs would be moved to london if the takeover is successful.  the works council has expressed concerns that the equities and derivatives trade could be managed from london in the future   reuters news agency reports a union source as saying. german politicians are also said to be angry over the market operator s promise to move its headquarters to london if a bid were successful.  meanwhile  lse shareholders fear that deutsche boerse s control over its clearstream unit - the clearing house that processes securities transactions - would create a monopoly situation. this would weaken the position of shareholders when negotiating lower transaction fees for share dealings. lse and euronext do not have control over their clearing and settlement operations  a situation which critics say is more transparent and competitive. the german group s ownership of clearstream has been seen as the main stumbling block to a london-frankfurt merger. commentators believe deutsche boerse  which has now formally asked german authorities to approve its plan to buy the lse  may offer to sell clearstream to gain shareholder approval. euronext  so far  has given little away as to what sweeteners it will offer the lse - europe s biggest equity market - into a deal.,french suitor hold lse meet european stock market euronext met london stock exchang lse amid specul may readi launch cash bid euronext chief jeanfrancoi theodor held talk lse bos clara fur day rival deutsch boer put forward bid case german exchang say held construct profession friendli talk lse euronext declin comment talk end friday specul mount german may rais bid £bn deutsch boer previous offer £bn reject lse euronext rumour facil place fund £bn cash bid far howev neither tabl formal bid deal either bidder would creat big stock market oper europ second big world new york stock exchang specul euronext would use friday meet opportun take advantag grow disquiet deutsch boer plan domin london market union deutsch boer staff frankfurt reportedli express fear job would move london takeov success work council express concern equiti deriv trade could manag london futur reuter news agenc report union sourc say german politician also say angri market oper promis move headquart london bid success meanwhil lse sharehold fear deutsch boer control clearstream unit clear hous process secur transact would creat monopoli situat would weaken posit sharehold negoti low transact fee share deal lse euronext control clear settlement oper situat critic say transpar competit german group ownership clearstream see main stumbl block londonfrankfurt merger comment believ deutsch boer formal ask german author approv plan buy lse may offer sell clearstream gain sharehold approv euronext far give littl away sweeten offer lse europ big equiti market deal
209,1976,lifestyle  governs mobile choice  faster  better or funkier hardware alone is not going to help phone firms sell more handsets  research suggests.  instead  phone firms keen to get more out of their customers should not just be pushing the technology for its own sake. consumers are far more interested in how handsets fit in with their lifestyle than they are in screen size  onboard memory or the chip inside  shows an in-depth study by handset maker ericsson.  historically in the industry there has been too much focus on using technology   said dr michael bjorn  senior advisor on mobile media at ericsson s consumer and enterprise lab.  we have to stop saying that these technologies will change their lives   he said.  we should try to speak to consumers in their own language and help them see how it fits in with what they are doing   he told the bbc news website.  for the study  ericsson interviewed 14 000 mobile phone owners on the ways they use their phone.  people s habits remain the same   said dr bjorn.  they just move the activity into the mobile phone as it s a much more convenient way to do it.   one good example of this was diary-writing among younger people  he said. while diaries have always been popular  a mobile phone -- especially one equipped with a camera -- helps them keep it in a different form. youngsters  use of text messages also reflects their desire to chat and keep in contact with friends and again just lets them do it in a slightly changed way. dr bjorn said that although consumers do what they always did but use a phone to do it  the sheer variety of what the new handset technologies make possible does gradually drive new habits and lifestyles. ericsson s research has shown that consumers divide into different  tribes  that use phones in different ways. dr bjorn said groups dubbed  pioneers  and  materialists  were most interested in trying new things and were behind the start of many trends in phone use.  for instance   he said   older people are using sms much more than they did five years ago.  this was because younger users  often the children of ageing mobile owners  encouraged older people to try it so they could keep in touch.  another factor governing the speed of change in mobile phone use was the simple speed with which new devices are bought by pioneers and materialists. only when about 25% of people have handsets with new innovations on them  such as cameras  can consumers stop worrying that if they send a picture message the person at the other end will be able to see it.  once this significant number of users is passed  use of new innovations tends to take off. dr bjorn said that early reports of camera phone usage in japan seemed to imply that the innovation was going to be a flop. however  he said  now 45% of the japanese people ericsson questioned use their camera phone at least once a month. in 2003 the figure was 29%. similarly  across europe the numbers of people taking snaps with cameras is starting to rise. in 2003 only 4% of the people in the uk took a phonecam snap at least once a month. now the figure is 14%. similar rises have been seen in many other european nations. dr bjorn said that people also used their camera phones in very different ways to film and even digital cameras.  usage patterns for digital cameras are almost exactly replacing usage patterns for analogue cameras   he said. digital cameras tend to be used on significant events such as weddings  holidays and birthdays. by contrast  he said  camera phones were being used much more to capture a moment and were being woven into everyday life.,lifestyl govern mobil choic faster well funkier hardwar alon go help phone firm sell handset research suggest instead phone firm keen

210,616,gadgets galore on show at fair the 2005 consumer electronics show in las vegas is a geek s paradise with more than 50 000 new gadgets and technologies launched during the four-day event.  top gadgets at the show are highlighted in the innovations showcase  which recognises some of the hottest developments in consumer electronics. the bbc news website took an early pre-show look at some of those technologies that will be making their debut in 2005.      one of the key issues for keen gadget users is how to store all their digital images  audio and video files. the 2.5gb and 5gb circular pocket hard drive from seagate might help. the external usb drive won a ces best innovations design and engineering award and is small enough to slip into a pocket.  it is the kind of storage that appeals to people who want their pcs to look cool   said seagate.  it is all about style but it also has lots of functionality.   it is the first time you can say a hard drive is sexy   it said. in the centre of the device is a blue light that flashes while data is being written to ensure users do not unplug it when it is busy saving those precious pictures.      universal electronics  nevosl is a universal controller that lets people use one device to get at their multimedia content  such as photos  no matter where it is in their house. it can also act as a remote for home theatre and stereo systems. working with home broadband networks and pcs  the gadget has built-in wireless and a colourful  simple interface. paul arling  uei chief  said consumers face real problems when trying to get at all the files they own that are typically spread across several different devices. he said the nevo gave people a simple  single way to regain some control over digital media in the home. the nevo won two awards at ces  one as a girl s best friend award and another for innovation  design and engineering. the gadget is expected to go on sale before the summer and will cost about $799 (£425).      hotseat is targeting keen gamers with money to spend with its solo chassis gaming chair. the specially-designed chair lets gamers play in surround-sound while stretching out in their own  space . it is compatible with all the major games consoles  dvd players and pcs.  we found that kids love playing in surround sound   said jay leboff from hotseat.  we are looking at offering different types of seats  depending on the market success of this one.  the chair also lets people experience surround sound while watching videos  with wireless control for six surround sound speakers. and a drinks holder. the chair  which looks like a car seat on a skeletal frame  should go on sale in april and is expected to cost $399 (£211).      satellite radio is big business in the us. in the uk  the digital radio technology is known as dab and works on slightly different technology. eton corporation s porsche designed p7131 digital radio set will be launched both as a dab radio in the uk as well as a satellite radio set in the us. dab sets have been slow to take-off in the uk  but this one concentrates on sleek looks as much as technology.  it is for the risqu&#233; consumer   said an eton spokesperson.  we are proud of it because it has the sound quality for the audiophile and the looks for the design-conscious consumer.  the porsche radio is set to go on sale at the end of january in the us and in the first quarter of 2005 in the uk. in the us is it expected to cost $250 (£133).      the average person has a library of 600 digital images estimates the consumer electronics association  the organisation behind ces. this is expected to grow to a massive 3 420 images - or 7.2gb - in five years  time. one gadget that might help swell that collection is sanyo s tiny handheld vpc-c4 camcorder which is another innovation in design and engineering award winner. it combines high quality video and stills in a very small device. it takes mpeg4 video quality at 30 frames a second and has a four megapixel still camera. images and video are stored on sd cards  which have come down in price in recent months. a 512mb card will store about 30 minutes of video and 420 stills. the device is so tiny it can be controlled with one thumb. because images and video are stored on sd memory  it is portable to other devices and means other data like audio can be stored on the card too.      wearable technology has always promised much but failed to deliver because of lack of storage capability and poor design. mpio s tiny digital usb music players come in an array of fashionable colours  taking a leaf out of the apple ipod mini book of design and reflecting the desire for gadgets that look good. slung on a cord  the player would not look too geeky dangling discreetly from the neck. although the pendant design was launched three months ago  the device emphasises large storage as well as good looks for fashion-conscious gadget fiends. an even dinkier model  the fy500  comes out in may and will store about 256mb of music. the range of players recently won an international forum design award 2005.,gadget galor show fair consum electron show la vega geek paradis new gadget technolog launch fourday event top gadget show highlight innov showcas recognis hottest develop consum electron bbc news websit take earli preshow look technolog make debut one key issu keen gadget user store digit imag audio video file gb gb circular pocket hard drive seagat might help extern usb drive ce best innov design engin award small enough slip pocket kind storag appeal peopl want pc look cool say seagat style also lot function first time say hard drive sexi say centr devic blue light flash data write ensur user unplug busi save preciou pictur univers electron nevosl univers control let peopl use one devic get multimedia content photo matter hous also act remot home theatr stereo system work home broadband network pc gadget builtin wireless colour simpl interfac paul arl uei chief say consum face real problem tri get file typic spread across sever differ devic say nevo give peopl simpl singl way regain control digit medium home nevo two award ce one girl best friend award anoth innov design engin gadget expect go sale summer cost £ hotseat target keen gamer money spend solo chassi game chair speciallydesign chair let gamer play surroundsound stretch space compat major game consol dvd player pc found kid love play surround sound say jay leboff hotseat look offer differ type seat depend market success one chair also let peopl experi surround sound watch video wireless control six surround sound speaker drink holder chair look like car seat skelet frame go sale april expect cost £ satellit radio big busi u uk digit radio technolog know dab work slightli differ technolog eton corpor porsch design p digit radio set launch dab radio uk well satellit radio set u dab set slow takeoff uk one concentr sleek look much technolog risqu consum say eton spokesperson proud sound qualiti audiophil look designconsci consum porsch radio set go sale end januari u first quarter uk u expect cost £ averag person librari digit imag estim consum electron associ organis behind ce expect grow massiv imag gb five year time one gadget might help swell collect sanyo tini handheld vpcc camcord anoth innov design engin award winner combin high qualiti video still small devic take mpeg video qualiti frame second four megapixel still camera imag video store sd card come price recent month mb card store minut video still devic tini control one thumb imag video store sd memori portabl devic mean data like audio store card wearabl technolog alway promis much fail deliv lack storag capabl poor design mpio tini digit usb music player come array fashion colour take leaf appl ipod mini book design reflect desir gadget look good slung cord player would look geeki dangl discreetli neck although pendant design launch three month ago devic emphasis larg storag well good look fashionconsci gadget fiend even dinkier model fy come may store mb music rang player recent intern forum design award

213,1582,howard  truanted to play snooker  conservative leader michael howard has admitted he used to play truant to spend time with his school friends at a snooker hall.  mr howard said his time at jack s snooker hall in llanelli in the 1950s had not done him  any lasting damage . but he told the times educational supplement that truancy was  very bad  and said  firm action  was needed. mr howard also called for a return to o-levels and more classroom discipline.  mr howard eventually left llanelli grammar school - and the snooker hall - to go to cambridge university. he said:  i don t think it s done me any lasting damage. nor has it made me a snooker world champion.  there might have been some occasions when we left early of an afternoon.   i m just being honest. i think truancy is a very bad thing and that firm action should be taken to deal with it.  another player who has failed to win snooker s world championship - jimmy  the whirlwind   white - has previously admitted missing lessons  instead spending his days in smoky halls.  tony meo [another player] and me used to spend all of our spare time there   mr white said   we loved the game and the atmosphere.  school went out of the window. i went for a while and then started taking time off.  mr howard s fellow welshman ray reardon - known by his fellow professionals as  dracula  - won the snooker world championship six times  having left school at 14 to work as a miner. and terry griffiths  like mr howard from llanelli  won the tournament in 1979. it is not known whether the two of them ever clashed cues at jack s.,howard truant play snooker conserv leader michael howard admit use play truant spend time school friend snooker hall mr howard say time jack snooker hall llanelli s do last damag told time educ supplement truanci bad say firm action need mr howard also call return olevel classroom disciplin mr howard eventu left llanelli grammar school snooker hall go cambridg univers say think do last damag make snooker world champion might occas left earli afternoon honest think truanci bad thing firm action take deal anoth player fail win snooker world championship jimmi whirlwind white previous admit miss lesson instead spend day smoki hall toni meo anoth player use spend spare time mr white say love game atmospher school go window go start take time mr howard fellow welshman ray reardon know fellow profession dracula snooker world championship six time left school work miner terri griffith like mr howard llanelli tournament know whether two ever clash cue jack
214,1485,tsunami to cost sri lanka $1.3bn sri lanka faces a $1.3bn (£691m) bill in 2005 for reconstruction after the tsunami which killed more than 30 000 of its people  its central bank says.  this estimate is preliminary  bank governor sunil mendis told reporters  and could rise in 2006. the island state is asking for about $320m from the international monetary fund to help pay for relief  he said. the bank has 5bn rupees ($50m; £27m) set aside to lend at a lower interest rate to those who lost property. according to mr mendis  half the imf support could come from a freeze on debt repayments  which would free up resources immediately. the rest could come from a five-year emergency loan. sri lanka is hoping for a wider freeze from other creditors.  the paris club of 19 creditors meets on 12 january to discuss a debt moratorium for the nations hit by the tsunami  which ravaged south and east asia on 26 december.  some 150 000 people across the region are feared to be dead and millions have been left homeless and destitute. a full reckoning of the economic cost to sri lanka of the tsunami will not be clear for some time to come. but already it looks likely that growth in the first half of 2005 will slow  mr mendis told reporters  although he would not say by how much. one side-effect of the disaster has been that the value of the rupee has risen as foreign funds have flooded into the country. the currency has strengthened 4% since late december  coming close to 100 rupees to the us dollar for the first time in more than six months.,tsunami cost sri lanka bn sri lanka face bn £m bill reconstruct tsunami kill peopl central bank say estim preliminari bank governor sunil mendi told report could rise island state ask m intern monetari fund help pay relief say bank bn rupe m £m set asid lend low interest rate lose properti accord mr mendi half imf support could come freez debt repay would free resourc immedi rest could come fiveyear emerg loan sri lanka hope wider freez creditor pari club creditor meet januari discus debt moratorium nation hit tsunami ravag south east asia decemb peopl across region fear dead million left homeless destitut full reckon econom cost sri lanka tsunami clear time come alreadi look like growth first half slow mr mendi told report although would say much one sideeffect disast valu rupe risen foreign fund flood countri currenc strengthen sinc late decemb come close rupe u dollar first time six month

216,231,tv show unites angolan families angolan families who are attempting to track each other down  after being separated by nearly 30 years of war  are succeeding thanks to a hugely popular tv show.  meeting point has become one of tv angola s most watched programmes  and has reunited hundreds of families. it runs daily  not only on the television but also on the radio. every friday  hundreds of people gather in luanda s independence square to record a message in front of the tv cameras  in the hope that a lost relative will see it. many relatives have been reunited on air.  at the beginning there was an absolute explosion - huge  huge crowds   sergio gera  the programme s chief co-ordinator  told bbc world service s assignment programme.  now things are a little calmer  there are slightly less people - but  after two and a half years of broadcasting  there are still a lot of people going.   the media in the southern african country  twice the size of france  has been gripped by the quest of so many people to find their relatives. hundreds of thousands of people died in angola s 30-year civil war  which finally ended in 2002  and tens of thousands of people are still missing. many have not heard anything for 10 or more years - in all  90% of angolan families have lost someone.  the idea of recording in independence square was modelled on a square in the argentine capital buenos aries  where mothers go to talk about the dead and the missing  and to exchange news. one woman  victoria lapete  found her sister - the only remaining member of her family - in independence square live on meeting point. she had not seen her sibling for 28 years.  when we saw each other  we threw ourselves into each other s arms   she told assignment.  we started to cry. i felt very  very happy  because i d spent so long without any family. suddenly i had a sister again.  however  angola is one of the poorest countries in africa  and the number of people with access to either a television or radio is comparatively few. this means that elsewhere in the country  the task of reuniting families lies primarily with the international committee of the red cross (icrc). in the city of wambo  the icrc runs the gazetta - a 200-page  tabloid-size book which contains 13 000 names of missing or displaced.  their task is made much harder by the huge number of landmines dotted around the country.  it s very difficult - there are many displaced   stated joaquim sahundi  head of tracing in wambo.   as they try to go back [home]  others are trying to relocate their relatives. many people are getting injured because of that - in the villages  in the bush  there has been no clearance of mines.  when people are crossing these areas  they step on mines.  the icrc also uses the media where it can  running four daily broadcasts of their lists of the missing on radio angola. meanwhile  there remain massive challenges to angolan families even once they are reunited.  the programme of family reunification is extremely important  but for these families to remain reunified  there has to be social integration  job access  education  healthcare   said rafael marques of the pro-democracy george soros foundation for southern africa.  essentially the government is waiting for the international community to pay for the reconstruction - that s why it has been persistently calling for a donor s conference. that is just a way of detaching itself from its political responsibilities.,tv show unit angolan famili angolan famili attempt track separ nearli year war succeed thank huge popular tv show meet point becom one tv angola watch programm reunit hundr famili run daili televis also radio everi friday hundr peopl gather luanda independ squar record messag front tv camera hope lose rel see mani rel reunit air begin absolut explos huge huge crowd sergio gera programm chief coordin told bbc world servic assign programm thing littl calmer slightli less peopl two half year broadcast still lot peopl go medium southern african countri twice size franc grip quest mani peopl find rel hundr thousand peopl die angola year civil war final end ten thousand peopl still miss mani heard anyth year angolan famili lose someon idea record independ squar model squar argentin capit bueno ari mother go talk dead miss exchang news one woman victoria lapet found sister remain member famili independ squar live meet point see sibl year saw threw arm told assign start cri felt happi spent long without famili suddenli sister howev angola one poorest countri africa number peopl access either televis radio compar mean elsewher countri task reunit famili lie primarili intern committe red cross icrc citi wambo icrc run gazetta page tabloid book contain name miss displac task make much harder huge number landmin dot around countri difficult mani displac state joaquim sahundi head trace wambo tri go back home other tri reloc rel mani peopl get injur villag bush clearanc mine peopl cross area step mine icrc also use medium run four daili broadcast list miss radio angola meanwhil remain massiv challeng angolan famili even reunit programm famili reunif extrem import famili remain reunifi social integr job access educ healthcar say rafael marqu prodemocraci georg soro foundat southern africa essenti govern wait intern commun pay reconstruct persist call donor confer way detach polit respons
217,1532,security scares spark browser fix microsoft is working on a new version of its internet explorer web browser.  the revamp has been prompted by microsoft s growing concern with security as well as increased competition from rival browsers. microsoft said the new version will be far less vulnerable to the bugs that make its current browser a favourite of tech-savvy criminals. test versions of the new program  called ie 7  are due to be released by the summer.  the announcement about internet explorer was made by bill gates  microsoft chairman and chief software architect  during a keynote speech at the rsa security conference currently being held in san francisco. although details were scant  mr gates  said ie7 would include new protections against viruses  spyware and phishing scams. this last category of threats involves criminals setting up spoof websites that look identical to those of banks and try to trick people into handing over login and account information.  in a bid to shore up the poor security in ie 6  microsoft has regularly issued updates to patch loopholes exploited by criminals and the makers of nuisance programs such as spyware. earlier this month it released a security bulletin that patched eight critical security holes - some of which were found in the ie browser. microsoft has also made a series of acquisitions of small firms that specialise in computer security. one of the first fruits of these acquisitions appeared last month with the release of a microsoft anti-spyware program. an own-brand anti-virus program is due to follow by the end of 2005. the decision to make internet explorer 7 is widely seen as a u-turn because  before now  microsoft said it had no need to update the browser. typically new versions of its browser appear with successive versions of the windows operating system. a new version of ie was widely expected to debut with the next version of windows  codenamed longhorn  which is due to appear in 2006. the current version of internet explorer is four years old  and is widely seen as falling behind rivals such as firefox and opera. there are also persistent rumours that search engine google is poised to produce its own brand browser based on firefox. in particular the firefox browser has been winning fans and users since its first full version was released in november 2004. estimates of how many users firefox has won over vary widely. according to market statistics gathered by websidestory  firefox s market share is now about 5% of all users. however  other browser stat gatherers say the figure is closer to 15%. some technical websites report that a majority of their visitors use the firefox browser. internet explorer still dominates with a share of about 90% but this is down from a peak of almost 96% in mid-2004.,secur scare spark browser fix microsoft work new version internet explor web browser revamp prompt microsoft grow concern secur well increas competit rival browser microsoft say new version far less vulner bug make current browser favourit techsavvi crimin test version new program call ie due releas summer announc internet explor make bill gate microsoft chairman chief softwar architect keynot speech rsa secur confer current held san francisco although detail scant mr gate say ie would includ new protect virus spywar phish scam last categori threat involv crimin set spoof websit look ident bank tri trick peopl hand login account inform bid shore poor secur ie microsoft regularli issu updat patch loophol exploit crimin maker nuisanc program spywar earlier month releas secur bulletin patch eight critic secur hole found ie browser microsoft also make seri acquisit small firm specialis comput secur one first fruit acquisit appear last month releas microsoft antispywar program ownbrand antiviru program due follow end decis make internet explor wide see uturn microsoft say need updat browser typic new version browser appear success version window oper system new version ie wide expect debut next version window codenam longhorn due appear current version internet explor four year old wide see fall behind rival firefox opera also persist rumour search engin googl poi produc brand browser base firefox particular firefox browser win fan user sinc first full version releas novemb estim mani user firefox vari wide accord market statist gather websidestori firefox market share user howev browser stat gather say figur closer technic websit report major visitor use firefox browser internet explor still domin share peak almost mid
218,1390,hewitt decries  career sexism  plans to extend paid maternity leave beyond six months should be prominent in labour s election manifesto  the trade and industry secretary has said.  patricia hewitt said the cost of the proposals was being evaluated  but it was an  increasingly high priority  and a  shared goal across government . ms hewitt was speaking at a gender and productivity seminar organised by the equal opportunities commission (eoc). mothers can currently take up to six months  paid leave - and six unpaid. ms hewitt told the seminar:  clearly  one of the things we need to do in the future is to extend the period of payment for maternity leave beyond the first six months into the second six months.  we are looking at how quickly we can do that  because obviously there are cost implications because the taxpayer reimburses the employers for the cost of that.   ms hewitt also announced a new drive to help women who want to work in male dominated sectors  saying sexism at work was still preventing women reaching their full potential. plans include funding for universities to help female science and engineering graduates find jobs and  taster courses  for men and women in non-traditional jobs. women in full-time work earn 19% less than men  according to the equal opportunities commission (eoc).  the minister told delegates that getting rid of  career sexism  was vital to closing the gender pay gap.   career sexism limits opportunities for women of all ages and prevents them from achieving their full potential.  it is simply wrong to assume someone cannot do a job on the grounds of their sex   she said. earlier  she told bbc radio 4 s today programme:  what we are talking about here is the fact that about six out of 20 women work in jobs that are low-paid and typically dominated by women  so we have got very segregated employment.  unfortunately  in some cases  this reflects very old-fashioned and stereotypical ideas about the appropriate jobs for women  or indeed for men.  career sexism is about saying that engineering  for instance  where only 10% of employees are women  is really a male-dominated industry. construction is even worse.  but it is also about saying childcare jobs are really there for women and not suitable for men. career sexism goes both ways.   she added that while progress had been made  there was still a gap in pay figures.  the average woman working full-time is being paid about 80p for every pound a man is earning. for women working part-time it is 60p.  the department for trade and industry will also provide funding to help a new pay experts panel run by the tuc.  it has been set up to advise hundreds of companies on equal wage policies. research conducted by the eoc last year revealed that many britons believe the pay gap between men and women is the result of  natural differences  between the sexes. women hold less than 10% of the top positions in ftse 100 companies  the police  the judiciary and trade unions  according to their figures. and retired women have just over half the income of their male counterparts on average.,hewitt decri career sexism plan extend paid matern leav beyond six month promin labour elect manifesto trade industri secretari say patricia hewitt say cost propos evalu increasingli high prioriti share goal across govern m hewitt speak gender product seminar organis equal opportun commiss eoc mother current take six month paid leav six unpaid m hewitt told seminar clearli one thing need futur extend period payment matern leav beyond first six month second six month look quickli obvious cost implic taxpay reimburs employ cost m hewitt also announc new drive help woman want work male domin sector say sexism work still prevent woman reach full potenti plan includ fund univers help femal scienc engin graduat find job taster cours men woman nontradit job woman fulltim work earn less men accord equal opportun commiss eoc minist told deleg get rid career sexism vital close gender pay gap career sexism limit opportun woman age prevent achiev full potenti simpli wrong assum someon job ground sex say earlier told bbc radio today programm talk fact six woman work job lowpaid typic domin woman get segreg employ unfortun case reflect oldfashion stereotyp idea appropri job woman inde men career sexism say engin instanc employe woman realli maledomin industri construct even wors also say childcar job realli woman suitabl men career sexism goe way ad progress make still gap pay figur averag woman work fulltim paid p everi pound man earn woman work parttim p depart trade industri also provid fund help new pay expert panel run tuc set advis hundr compani equal wage polici research conduct eoc last year reveal mani briton believ pay gap men woman result natur differ sex woman hold less top posit ftse compani polic judiciari trade union accord figur retir woman half incom male counterpart averag
219,1012,making your office work for you our mission to brighten up your working lives continues - and this time  we re taking a long hard look at your offices.  over the next few months  our panel of experts will be listening to your gripes about where you work  and suggesting ways to make your workspace more efficient  more congenial or simply prettier. this week  we re hearing from marianne petersen  who is planning to convert a barn in sweden into a base for her freelance writing work. click on the link under her photograph to read her story  and then scroll down to see what the panel have to say. and if you want to take part in the series  go to the bottom of the story to find out how to get in touch.  working from home presents a multitude of challenges. understanding your work personality allows you to work in terms of your own style. do you feel confident about your work output without conferring with others  are you able to retain discipline and self motivate to get the job done  do you build on the ideas of others - or are you a more introspective problem solver . in order for a virtual office to succeed  keeping the boundary between work and home life is essential. it may be useful to be quite rigid about who is allowed to visit  and to keep strict office hours. referring to the space as work will give those around you a clear message that this is professional space. it is imperative to consider how to bring the outside world into yours  keeping up to date with developments and maintaining a network. isolated work environments mean this has to be carefully thought out  and a strategy has to be developed that suits both your personality and your industry. joining professional groups or forming a loose association of like-minded people may assist. it is useful to structure these meetings in advance as often they get relegated to less important status when times are busy - with the danger that when the workload eases  they have to be resurrected.    prior to any interior work being undertaken it is essential to ensure that the roof and walls are made water-and-weather-tight  and the structure is checked for stability. it appears that the roof trusses may need repairs and additional bracing.  ideally  the roof should be replaced with an outer material in keeping with the character and location of the barn. this would also allow for a well-insulated inner skin to be provided which should be light coloured. it is likely that the most efficient way of heating the building is with electricity. in order to provide this the owner will need to have an electrical engineer calculate the potential heating  power and lighting load to make sure the mains supply and distribution capacity are adequate. ideally  it would be good to have a mains water supply and some means of drainage for toilet and washing facilities. the walls should be dry lined with a single skin of plasterboard laid over rockwool slab which will allow good wall insulation and the power and lighting circuits to be concealed  and the walls should be painted in a light colour. the owner mentions she might lay a new floor over the existing planks; this will improve the insulation and offer a level surface. i would suggest laying new oak veneer planks which can work in with the character of the barn. as for lighting  consider a combination of floor mounted uplights  wall lights (wall washers) and selected downlights. use a combination of mains voltage fluorescent fittings and dimmable units which can vary the light levels and the feel of the interior.    please click on the link to the right here to see my ideas for marianne s barn.  the layout of this office reflects the need to have a working area and a more relaxed meeting space. large desk space and extensive storage would combine with tub chairs to maximise the space available. the finishes chosen for the furniture will need to reflect the unusual setting  while the lighting and temperature control mechanisms used will further influence the workplace.    regarding accessing the internet via the connection in the main house  your plan of going wireless is sensible. a wireless router/access point in the house with a wireless lan card in the pc in the renovated area may be sufficient. however  important points to consider are the distance between the two buildings and the nature of the materials through which the signals have to pass  which could result in a weak signal strength. you may require an additional wireless access point in the renovated area. your local it supplier will be able to advise on this. if you haven t already invested in robust firewall and anti-virus software  it is essential to do so  to protect your investment. to really take advantage of wireless technology  you might consider a laptop computer and a docking station with external mouse and monitor. or you could use one of the new tablet computers  which allow you to write directly on the screen and convert into text with built-in hand recognition software. and finally  you will save money and space by considering a multi-function product for print  scan  copy and fax.,make offic work mission brighten work live continu time take long hard look offic next month panel expert listen gripe work suggest way make workspac effici congeni simpli prettier week hear mariann petersen plan convert barn sweden base freelanc write work click link photograph read stori scroll see panel say want take part seri go bottom stori find get touch work home present multitud challeng understand work person allow work term style feel confid work output without confer other abl retain disciplin self motiv get job do build idea other introspect problem solver order virtual offic succeed keep boundari work home life essenti may use quit rigid allow visit keep strict offic hour refer space work give around clear messag profession space imper consid bring outsid world keep date develop maintain network isol work environ mean care thought strategi develop suit person industri join profession group form loo associ likemind peopl may assist use structur meet advanc often get releg less import statu time busi danger workload ea resurrect prior interior work undertaken essenti ensur roof wall make waterandweathertight structur check stabil appear roof truss may need repair addit brace ideal roof replac outer materi keep charact locat barn would also allow wellinsul inner skin provid light colour like effici way heat build electr order provid owner need electr engin calcul potenti heat power light load make sure main suppli distribut capac adequ ideal would good main water suppli mean drainag toilet wash facil wall dri line singl skin plasterboard laid rockwool slab allow good wall insul power light circuit conceal wall paint light colour owner mention might lay new floor exist plank improv insul offer level surfac would suggest lay new oak veneer plank work charact barn light consid combin floor mount uplight wall light wall washer select downlight use combin main voltag fluoresc fit dimmabl unit vari light level feel interior plea click link right see idea mariann barn layout offic reflect need work area relax meet space larg desk space extens storag would combin tub chair maximis space avail finish chosen furnitur need reflect unusu set light temperatur control mechan use influenc workplac regard access internet via connect main hous plan go wireless sensibl wireless routeraccess point hous wireless lan card pc renov area may suffici howev import point consid distanc two build natur materi signal pas could result weak signal strength may requir addit wireless access point renov area local supplier abl advis alreadi invest robust firewal antiviru softwar essenti protect invest realli take advantag wireless technolog might consid laptop comput dock station extern mous monitor could use one new tablet comput allow write directli screen convert text builtin hand recognit softwar final save money space consid multifunct product print scan copi fax
220,749,tv debate urged for party chiefs broadcasters should fix a date for a pre-election televised debate between the three main political leaders  according to the hansard society.  it would then be up to tony blair  michael howard and charles kennedy to decide whether to take part  the non-partisan charity said. chairman lord holme argued that prime ministers should not have the right of veto on a matter  of public interest .  the broadcasters should make the decision to go ahead   he said.  lord holme s proposal for a televised debate comes just four months after millions of viewers were able to watch us president george w bush slug it out verbally with his democratic challenger john kerry. he said it was a  democratically dubious proposition  that it was up to the incumbent prime minister to decide whether a similar event takes place here.  if mr blair did not want to take part  the broadcasters could go ahead with an empty chair or cancel the event and explain their reasons why  lord holme said.  what makes the present situation even less acceptable is that although mr howard and mr kennedy have said they would welcome a debate  no-one has heard directly from the prime minister   he said.  it has been left to nudges and winks  hints and briefings from his aides and campaign managers to imply that mr blair doesn t want one  but we haven t heard from the prime minister himself.   lord holme  who has campaigned for televised debates at previous elections  said broadcasters were  more than willing to cooperate with the arrangements . opinion polls suggested that the idea had the backing of the public who like comparing the personalities and policies of the contenders in their own homes  he said.  lord holme argued that as part of their public service obligations  broadcasters  should make the decision to go ahead  as soon as the election is called. an independent third-party body such as the hansard society or electoral commission could work out the ground rules so they were fair to participants and informative to the public  he said.  it would be up to each party leader to accept or refuse   said lord holme.   if the prime minister s reported position is true and he does want to take part  he would then be obliged to say why publicly.  the broadcasters would then have the option of cancelling the event for obvious and well-understood reasons  or going ahead with an empty chair.  either way would be preferable to the present hidden veto.  the hansard society has long campaigned for televised debates and has published reports on the issue in 1997 and 2001. tony blair has already ruled out taking part in a televised debate during the forthcoming election campaign. last month he said:  we answer this every election campaign and  for the reasons i have given before  the answer is no   he said at his monthly news conference.,tv debat urg parti chief broadcast fix date preelect televis debat three main polit leader accord hansard societi would toni blair michael howard charl kennedi decid whether take part nonpartisan chariti say chairman lord holm argu prime minist right veto matter public interest broadcast make decis go ahead say lord holm propos televis debat come four month million viewer abl watch u presid georg w bush slug verbal democrat challeng john kerri say democrat dubiou proposit incumb prime minist decid whether similar event take place mr blair want take part broadcast could go ahead empti chair cancel event explain reason lord holm say make present situat even less accept although mr howard mr kennedi say would welcom debat noon heard directli prime minist say left nudg wink hint brief aid campaign manag impli mr blair want one heard prime minist lord holm campaign televis debat previou elect say broadcast will cooper arrang opinion poll suggest idea back public like compar person polici contend home say lord holm argu part public servic oblig broadcast make decis go ahead soon elect call independ thirdparti bodi hansard societi elector commiss could work ground rule fair particip inform public say would parti leader accept refus say lord holm prime minist report posit true want take part would oblig say publicli broadcast would option cancel event obviou wellunderstood reason go ahead empti chair either way would prefer present hidden veto hansard societi long campaign televis debat publish report issu toni blair alreadi rule take part televis debat forthcom elect campaign last month say answer everi elect campaign reason give answer say monthli news confer
221,236,consumer spending lifts us growth us economic growth accelerated in the third quarter  helped by strong consumer spending  official figures have shown.  the economy expanded at an annual rate of 3.7% in the july to september period  the commerce department said. the figure marked an increase on the 3.3% growth recorded in the second quarter  but fell short of the 4.2% rate pencilled in by forecasters. the increase reflected the biggest jump in consumer spending in a year.  it was a little softer than the consensus  but not a real surprise   said gary thayer  an economist at ag edwards & sons. friday s growth estimate is one of the last significant pieces of economic data before the 2 november presidential election.  democrat challenger john kerry has criticised president george w bush s handling of the economy  pointing to a net loss of over 800 000 jobs since mr bush took office. analysts said the economy was still not growing fast enough to stimulate large-scale job creation.  it s a pretty good growth rate  but it may not be good enough to create enough jobs   said robert brusca  chief economist at fact and opinion economics in new york. however  president bush is expected to point to commerce department figures showing that consumer spending grew at 4.6% in the third quarter  up from just 1.6% in the second  as evidence that his policies are generating solid growth. consumer spending accounts for about two thirds of all economic activity in the us.  the weaker than expected growth figure makes it less likely that the us federal reserve will raise interest rates next month  economists said.  the economy regained some traction in the third quarter  but the growth is not robust   ag edwards  thayer.  i think that means the fed can take its time raising rates. we ll probably see one more rate hike before the end of the year.  in an effort to pre-empt rising inflation  the federal reserve has pushed through three quarter-point rate rises since june this year  taking borrowing costs to 1.75%. on the financial markets  the dollar fell slightly against the euro and the yen  while the dow jones index of leading us shares was little changed.,consum spend lift u growth u econom growth acceler third quarter help strong consum spend offici figur show economi expand annual rate juli septemb period commerc depart say figur mark increas growth record second quarter fell short rate pencil forecast increas reflect big jump consum spend year littl softer consensu real surpris say gari thayer economist ag edward son friday growth estim one last signific piec econom data novemb presidenti elect democrat challeng john kerri criticis presid georg w bush handl economi point net loss job sinc mr bush take offic analyst say economi still grow fast enough stimul largescal job creation pretti good growth rate may good enough creat enough job say robert brusca chief economist fact opinion econom new york howev presid bush expect point commerc depart figur show consum spend grow third quarter second evid polici gener solid growth consum spend account two third econom activ u weaker expect growth figur make less like u feder reserv rais interest rate next month economist say economi regain traction third quarter growth robust ag edward thayer think mean fed take time rais rate probabl see one rate hike end year effort preempt rise inflat feder reserv push three quarterpoint rate rise sinc june year take borrow cost financi market dollar fell slightli euro yen dow jone index lead u share littl chang
222,1781,hobbit picture  four years away  lord of the rings director peter jackson has said that it will be up to four years before he starts work on a film version of the hobbit.  the oscar winner said on a visit to sydney there was a  desire  to make it  but not before lengthy negotiations.  i think it s gonna be a lot of lawyers sitting in a room trying to thrash out a deal before it will ever happen   said the new zealander. the rights to jrr tolkien s book are split between two major film studios. jackson  who is currently filming a remake of hollywood classic king kong  said he thought that the sale of mgm studios to the sony corporation would cast further uncertainty on the project. the 43-year-old was in the australian city to visit a lord of the rings exhibition  which has attracted 140 000 visitors since it opened in december.  the film-maker recently sued film company new line cinema for undisclosed damages over alleged withheld profits and lost revenue from the first part of the middle earth trilogy. the fellowship of the ring from 2001 went on to make worldwide profits of $291 million (£152 million). jackson is thought to have secured the most lucrative film directing deal in history to remake king kong  which is currently in production in wellington. the picture  which stars naomi watts and oscar winner adrien brody  is due to be released in december. jackson has also committed to making a film version of lovely bones  based on the best-selling book by alice sebold.,hobbit pictur four year away lord ring director peter jackson say four year start work film version hobbit oscar winner say visit sydney desir make lengthi negoti think gon na lot lawyer sit room tri thrash deal ever happen say new zealand right jrr tolkien book split two major film studio jackson current film remak hollywood classic king kong say thought sale mgm studio soni corpor would cast uncertainti project yearold australian citi visit lord ring exhibit attract visitor sinc open decemb filmmak recent su film compani new line cinema undisclos damag alleg withheld profit lose revenu first part middl earth trilog fellowship ring go make worldwid profit million £ million jackson thought secur lucr film direct deal histori remak king kong current product wellington pictur star naomi watt oscar winner adrien brodi due releas decemb jackson also commit make film version love bone base bestsel book alic sebold

224,1409,media gadgets get moving pocket-sized devices that let people carry around video and images are set to have a big year in 2005  according to industry experts.  last year saw the emergence of portable media players  such as the windows-based creative zen portable media player  the samsung yepp  the iriver pmc-100  and the archos av400 series among others. but this year  they are set to get smarter and more connected  to allow people to find more video to watch on them. archos launched its latest range of its linux-based portable media devices at the consumer electronics show in las vegas on friday. dubbed the pocket media assistant pma430  it crucially has wi-fi capability built-in for the first time.  consumers are showing a great thirst for devices that store all their media in one place for anywhere access   said henri crohas  chief of archos.  and now those consumers can stay connected and productive at the same time.  archos said the focus for the device is to be the second gadget in people s pockets  after the mobile.  unlike windows-based players  the archos av400 series devices have always been able to record from any video source  such as tvs  as well as playback. the content put onto the devices is copy protected so cannot then be swapped to another device.  recording is perhaps a crucial functionality for those who have not seen the point of portable video if there is not a lot of video to watch on it. and wi-fi connectivity opens up the possibility of content delivery via a high-speed wireless link. archos also announced that it would open up the software development kit to linux developers so that more applications could be created for the device. microsoft also made some announcements in the portable media arena at ces  primarily for us consumers though. it has agreed a content deal with personal video recorder company tivo  which bill gates also showcased in his keynote speech at ces. the tivo to go service means that us consumers will be able to take any programmes they record on their tivos and transfer it for free to watch on any of the windows-based portable media players or smartphones. it also said it had launched a service with mtv to let people watch comedy central  vh1 and country music tv on its devices. and a service is launching with msn to provide people with shortened versions of news  entertainment and other video on a subscription basis for download via the pc onto the portable devices. but the ability to record directly from tv  vcr  and digital cable and satellite boxes  which windows-based devices do not offer  certainly gives people more content to watch on the go too.  the increased capability of these devices  and the content deals that are being done  may go some way to persuading people to use them. recent research by jupiter suggested that people would prefer a device that was dedicated to music. only 13% of europeans wanted to watch video while on the move. more seemed interested in spending their cash on music-only devices.   this year  we are ready for an explosion of portable media   microsoft s mike coleman told the bbc news website.  we are very bullish about it. the fact that i can put photos on here too and share them is super-cool to the consumer   he added. the fact that europeans are far larger public transport users than americans is one reason why portable media will take off in the coming year too. there is a burgeoning market there for commuters to watch news and other programmes on their way to work. although microsoft s content distribution deals are for the us market at the moment  talks were  always on-going  with european content suppliers to offer similar services. various rights management issues have to be ironed out first however. but that does not prevent people from finding ways to create their own content to share online and swap on portable devices  particularly via those which are wi-fi enabled. the possibility is open for non-professional makers of video and audio to take advantage of the growing portable media market to distribute their work. ces  which runs from 6 to 9 january  showcases more than 50 000 new gadgets that will be hitting the shelves in 2005.,medium gadget get move pocket devic let peopl carri around video imag set big year accord industri expert last year saw emerg

225,1609,final hunts held as ban looms hunts in england and wales have begun on the last day that hunting with dogs is legal  with more due out later.  thousands of supporters are expected to turn out at more than 250 meets  many of which have altered their normal schedules to be out on a thursday. the ban on hunting with dogs comes into effect from 0001 gmt on friday. the countryside alliance had its latest legal bid to block the ban thwarted on wednesday when the appeal court ruled the hunting act was lawful.  but the group says hunting will continue in some form after the ban comes in  with hunts expected to test the new law to its limits. others are expected to defy the ban by continuing to hunt illegally.  anti-hunt organisations  for whom the ban is the culmination of years of campaigning  say they hope most will stay within the law. mike hobday  of the league against cruel sports  told bbc news:  we ve long urged them to go drag hunting - to follow an artificial scent - and that is what we hope they do.  but if they continue to chase foxes  to chase wild mammals around the countryside  that s against the law and we re confident they ll be brought to justice.  at the headquarters of quorn hunt in leicestershire  feelings were running high as hunt enthusiasts prepared for their final legal hunt. bbc correspondent sarah mukherjee said hunt supporters were in tears.  she said many people did not share the countryside alliance s optimism that hunting would be able to continue. farmer geoff brooks  a senior member of the quorn hunt  told bbc news people s lives  revolved around hunting . he described the ban as  ridiculous  and  badly thought out  but said it would be hard for most people to defy it as they would not want to risk their incomes by getting a criminal record.  at the court of appeal on wednesday  the countryside alliance failed in its attempt to have the hunting act ruled invalid. but it says the ban is unenforceable because the law is unclear and impossible to police.  the alliance says hunt supporters will go out and test this law to its limits on saturday. the league against cruel sports and the rspca say they will monitor hunts and assist police in bringing prosecutions. the association of chief police officers has issued guidance to forces on how to deal with the new rules. a spokesman said:  basically  it s not going to be police officers chasing about in cars across fields  it will be based on intelligence and information received as well.  the decision on how to police individual hunts will be left to local forces  with more officers sent to hunts where disruption is expected. he said police would consider evidence submitted by anti-hunt organisations on its merits.,final hunt held ban loom hunt england wale begin last day hunt dog legal due later thousand support expect turn meet mani alter normal schedul thursday ban hunt dog come effect gmt friday countrysid allianc late legal bid block ban thwart wednesday appeal court rule hunt act law group say hunt continu form ban come hunt expect test new law limit other expect defi ban continu hunt illeg antihunt organis ban culmin year campaign say hope stay within law mike hobday leagu cruel sport told bbc news long urg go drag hunt follow artifici scent hope continu chase fox chase wild mammal around countrysid law confid brought justic headquart quorn hunt leicestershir feel run high hunt enthusiast prepar final legal hunt bbc correspond sarah mukherje say hunt support tear say mani peopl share countrysid allianc optim hunt would abl continu farmer geoff brook senior member quorn hunt told bbc news peopl live revolv around hunt describ ban ridicul badli thought say would hard peopl defi would want risk incom get crimin record court appeal wednesday countrysid allianc fail attempt hunt act rule invalid say ban unenforc law unclear imposs polic allianc say hunt support go test law limit saturday leagu cruel sport rspca say monitor hunt assist polic bring prosecut associ chief polic offic issu guidanc forc deal new rule spokesman say basic go polic offic chase car across field base intellig inform receiv well decis polic individu hunt left local forc offic sent hunt disrupt expect say polic would consid evid submit antihunt organis merit

227,403,warnings about junk mail deluge the amount of spam circulating online could be about to undergo a massive increase  say experts.  anti-spam group spamhaus is warning about a novel virus which hides the origins of junk mail. the program makes spam look like it is being sent by legitimate mail servers making it hard to spot and filter out. spamhaus said that if the problem went unchecked real e-mail messages could get drowned by the sheer amount of junk being sent.  before now many spammers have recruited home pcs to act as anonymous e-mail relays in an attempt to hide the origins of their junk mail. the pcs are recruited using viruses and worms that compromise machines via known vulnerabilities or by tricking people into opening an attachment infected with the malicious program. once compromised the machines start to pump out junk mail on behalf of spammers. spamhaus helps to block junk messages from these machines by collecting and circulating blacklists of net addresses known to harbour infected machines. but the novel worm spotted recently by spamhaus routes junk via the mail servers of the net service firm that infected machines used to get online in the first place. in this way the junk mail gets a net address that looks legitimate. as blocking all mail from net firms just to catch the spam is impractical  spamhaus is worried that the technique will give junk mailers the ability to spam with little fear of being spotted and stopped. steve linford  director of spamhaus  predicted that if a lot of spammers exploit this technique it could trigger the failure of the net s e-mail sending infrastructure. david stanley  uk managing director of filtering firm ciphertrust  said the new technique was the next logical step for spammers.  they are adding to their armoury   he said. the amount of spam in circulation was still growing  said mr stanley  but he did not think that the appearance of this trick would mean e-mail meltdown. but kevin hogan  senior manager at symantec security response  said such warnings were premature.  if something like this mean the end of e-mail then e-mail would have stopped two-three years ago   said mr hogan. while the technique of routing mail via mail servers of net service firms might cause problems for those that use blacklists and block lists it did not mean that other techniques for stopping spam lost their efficacy too. mr hogan said 90% of the junk mail filtered by symantec subsidiary brightmail was spotted using techniques that did not rely on looking at net addresses. for instance  said mr hogan  filtering out e-mail messages that contain a web link can stop about 75% of spam.,warn junk mail delug amount spam circul onlin could undergo massiv increas say expert antispam group spamhau warn novel viru hide origin junk mail program make spam look like sent legitim mail server make hard spot filter spamhau say problem go uncheck real email messag could get drown sheer amount junk sent mani spammer recruit home pc act anonym email relay attempt hide origin junk mail pc recruit use virus worm compromis machin via know vulner trick peopl open attach infect malici program compromis machin start pump junk mail behalf spammer spamhau help block junk messag machin collect circul blacklist net address know harbour infect machin novel worm spot recent spamhau rout junk via mail server net servic firm infect machin use get onlin first place way junk mail get net address look legitim block mail net firm catch spam impract spamhau worri techniqu give junk mailer abil spam littl fear spot stop steve linford director spamhau predict lot spammer exploit techniqu could trigger failur net email send infrastructur david stanley uk manag director filter firm ciphertrust say new techniqu next logic step spammer ad armouri say amount spam circul still grow say mr stanley think appear trick would mean email meltdown kevin hogan senior manag symantec secur respons say warn prematur someth like mean end email email would stop twothre year ago say mr hogan techniqu rout mail via mail server net servic firm might caus problem use blacklist block list mean techniqu stop spam lose efficaci mr hogan say junk mail filter symantec subsidiari brightmail spot use techniqu reli look net address instanc say mr hogan filter email messag contain web link stop spam

229,169,blair dismisses quit claim report tony blair has dismissed reports he told gordon brown he would quit before the next general election.   you don t do deals over jobs like this   the prime minister told bbc one s breakfast with frost programme. according to a new book  brown s britain  mr blair went back on a pledge to make way for mr brown after cabinet allies intervened in june 2004. mr blair said the claims were  reheated from six months ago  and that he was concentrating on running the country. mr blair said:  i ve dealt with this six months ago. i said then you don t do deals over jobs like this - you don t.   what both of us are actually concentrating on are the issues that concern the country.  the book  by sunday telegraph journalist robert peston and serialised in the newspaper  said the pair had  mutual animosity and contempt  for each other.  it claims tony blair felt by november 2003 he had lost voters  trust because of the iraq war and that he was no longer an asset to the labour party. and that at a dinner hosted by deputy prime minister john prescott he told mr brown of his intention to stand down. according to mr peston the prime minister said:  help me to get through the year and i will then stand down.  but he then changed his mind in june 2004  following intervention from allies in the cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him  according to the book.  mr peston told bbc news:  my understanding is that they are not nearly as close or as friendly as they once were.  what the book says is there is now a pretty profound mutual mistrust  mutual animosity.  i think in public you see this double-act pretending everything is alright  but in private i don t think the relationship is good because brown  understandably  feels deeply betrayed - particularly over this issue of the leadership.  but  in a wide-ranging bbc interview covering issues such as the asian tsunami disaster  the middle east peace process and northern ireland  mr blair said:  when you get to the top in politics you get this huge swell around you.  all sorts of people make all sorts of claims and counter-claims.  he admitted to a  sense of frustration  about the allegations which he said had been made  countless times .  there has been fresh speculation of a rift recently  following their separate responses to the asian tsunami. these rumours were fuelled by mr blair s decision to hold his monthly media conference at the same time as a long-planned speech by mr brown on uk plans to tackle global poverty with a new  marshall plan  for africa. there was speculation the pair were trying to outdo each other s response to the disaster. but the prime minister said he had discussed these claims with the chancellor and dismissed them as a  load of nonsense . former welfare minister frank field mp said the prime minister should sack mr brown  but did not believe mr blair was strong enough to do so.  tory leader michael howard accused the prime minister and mr brown of  squabbling like schoolboys . he told sky news  sunday with adam boulton:  this is the politics of the playground and britain really does deserve better.  the liberal democrat parliamentary chairman matthew taylor said the personal ambition of mr blair and mr brown was  getting in the way of good government .  either they need to grow up and put their squabbles to one side or they cannot expect the electorate to support a divided government at the next election.  during the interview mr blair also said the former home secretary david blunkett would play a  big role  at the general election.,blair dismiss quit claim report toni blair dismiss report told gordon brown would quit next gener elect deal job like prime minist told bbc one breakfast frost programm accord new book brown britain mr blair go back pledg make way mr brown cabinet alli interven june mr blair say claim reheat six month ago concentr run countri mr blair say dealt six month ago say deal job like u actual concentr issu concern countri book sunday telegraph journalist robert peston serialis newspap say pair mutual animos contempt claim toni blair felt novemb lose voter trust iraq war longer asset labour parti dinner host deputi prime minist john prescott told mr brown intent stand accord mr peston prime minist say help get year stand chang mind june follow intervent alli cabinet suspicion chancellor deliber manoeuvr accord book mr peston told bbc news understand nearli close friendli book say pretti profound mutual mistrust mutual animos think public see doubleact pretend everyth alright privat think relationship good brown understand feel deepli betray particularli issu leadership widerang bbc interview cover issu asian tsunami disast middl east peac process northern ireland mr blair say get top polit get huge swell around sort peopl make sort claim counterclaim admit sen frustrat alleg say make countless time fresh specul rift recent follow separ respons asian tsunami rumour fuell mr blair decis hold monthli medium confer time longplan speech mr brown uk plan tackl global poverti new marshal plan africa specul pair tri outdo respons disast prime minist say discus claim chancellor dismiss load nonsens former welfar minist frank field mp say prime minist sack mr brown believ mr blair strong enough torus leader michael howard accus prime minist mr brown squabbl like schoolboy told sky news sunday adam boulton polit playground britain realli deserv well liber democrat parliamentari chairman matthew taylor say person ambit mr blair mr brown get way good govern either need grow put squabbl one side expect elector support divid govern next elect interview mr blair also say former home secretari david blunkett would play big role gener elect

231,1968,brainwave  cap controls computer a team of us researchers has shown that controlling devices with the brain is a step closer.  four people  two of them partly paralysed wheelchair users  successfully moved a computer cursor while wearing a cap with 64 electrodes. previous research has shown that monkeys can control a computer with electrodes implanted into their brain. the new york team reported their findings in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences.  the results show that people can learn to use scalp-recorded electroencephalogram rhythms to control rapid and accurate movement of a cursor in two directions   said jonathan wolpaw and dennis mcfarlane. the research team  from new york state department of health and state university of new york in albany  said the research was another step towards people controlling wheelchairs or other electronic devices by thought.  the four people faced a large video screen wearing a special cap which  meant no surgery or implantation was needed.  brain activity produces electrical signals that can be read by electrodes. complex algorithms then translate those signals into instructions to direct the computer. such brain activity does not require the use of any nerves of muscles  so people with stroke or spinal cord injuries could use the cap effectively.  the impressive non-invasive multidimensional control achieved in the present study suggests that a non-invasive brain control interface could support clinically useful operation of a robotic arm  a motorised wheelchair or a neuroprosthesis   said the researchers. the four volunteers also showed that they could get better at controlling the cursor the more times they tried. although the two partially-paralysed people performed better overall  the researchers said this could be because their brains were more used to adapting or that they were simply more motivated. it is not the first time researchers have had this sort of success in brain-control experiments. some teams have used eye motion and other recording techniques. earlier this year  a team at the mit media labs europe demonstrated a wireless cap which read brain waves to control a computer character.,brainwav cap control comput team u research show control devic brain step closer four peopl two partli paralys wheelchair user success move comput cursor wear cap electrod previou research show monkey control comput electrod implant brain new york team report find proceed nation academi scienc result show peopl learn use scalprecord electroencephalogram rhythm control rapid accur movement cursor two direct say jonathan wolpaw denni mcfarlan research team new york state depart health state univers new york albani say research anoth step toward peopl control wheelchair electron devic thought four peopl face larg video screen wear special cap meant surgeri implant need brain activ produc electr signal read electrod complex algorithm translat signal instruct direct comput brain activ requir use nerv muscl peopl stroke spinal cord injuri could use cap effect impress noninvas multidimension control achiev present studi suggest noninvas brain control interfac could support clinic use oper robot arm motoris wheelchair neuroprosthesi say research four volunt also show could get well control cursor time tri although two partiallyparalys peopl perform well overal research say could brain use adapt simpli motiv first time research sort success braincontrol experi team use eye motion record techniqu earlier year team mit medium lab europ demonstr wireless cap read brain wave control comput charact
232,431,s korea spending boost to economy south korea will boost state spending next year in an effort to create jobs and kick start its sputtering economy.  it has earmarked 100 trillion won ($96bn) for the first six months of 2005  60% of its total annual budget. the government s main problems are  slumping consumption and a contraction in the construction industry . it aims to create 400 000 jobs and will focus on infrastructure and home building  as well as providing public firms with money to hire new workers.  the government has set an economic growth rate target of 5% for next year and hinted that would be in danger unless it took action.  internal and external economic conditions are likely to remain unfavourable in 2005   the finance and economy ministry said in a statement.  it blamed  continuing uncertainties such as fluctuating oil prices and foreign exchange rates and stagnant domestic demand that has shown few signs of a quick rebound . in 2004  growth will be between 4.7% and 4.8%  the ministry said. not everyone is convinced the plan will work.  our primary worry centres on the what we believe is the government s overly optimistic view that its front loading of the budget will be enough to turn the economy around   consultancy 4cast said in a report.  the problem facing south korea is that many consumers are reeling from the effects of a credit bubble that only recently burst. millions of south koreans are defaulting on their credit card bills  and the country s biggest card lender has been hovering on the verge of bankruptcy for months. as part of its spending plans  the government said it will ask firms to  roll over mortgage loans that come due in the first half of 2005  . it also pledged to look at ways of helping families on low incomes.  the government voiced concern about the effect of redundancies in the building trade.  given the economic spill over and employment effect in the construction sector  a sharp downturn in the construction industry could have other adverse effects   the ministry said.  as a result  south korea will give private companies also will be given the chance to build schools  hospitals  houses and other public buildings. it also will look at real estate tax system. other plans on the table include promoting new industries such as bio-technology and nano-technology  as well as offering increased support to small and medium sized businesses.  the focus will be on job creation and economic recovery  given that unfavourable domestic and global conditions are likely to dog the korean economy in 2005   the ministry said.,korea spend boost economi south korea boost state spend next year effort creat job kick start sputter economi earmark trillion bn first six month total annual budget govern main problem slump consumpt contract construct industri aim creat job focu infrastructur home build well provid public firm money hire new worker govern set econom growth rate target next year hint would danger unless take action intern extern econom condit like remain unfavour financ economi ministri say statement blame continu uncertainti fluctuat oil price foreign exchang rate stagnant domest demand show sign quick rebound growth ministri say everyon convinc plan work primari worri centr believ govern overli optimist view front load budget enough turn economi around consult cast say report problem face south korea mani consum reel effect credit bubbl recent burst million south korean default credit card bill countri big card lender hover verg bankruptci month part spend plan govern say ask firm roll mortgag loan come due first half also pledg look way help famili low incom govern voic concern effect redund build trade give econom spill employ effect construct sector sharp downturn construct industri could advers effect ministri say result south korea give privat compani also give chanc build school hospit hous public build also look real estat tax system plan tabl includ promot new industri biotechnolog nanotechnolog well offer increas support small medium size busi focu job creation econom recoveri give unfavour domest global condit like dog korean economi ministri say
233,467,healey targets england comeback leicester wing austin healey hopes to use sunday s return heineken cup clash with wasps as a further springboard to an england recall for the six nations.  healey  who won 51 caps prior to the 2003 world cup  has been in good form in the tigers  resurgence this season.  i definitely still have ambitions to play for england   healey told the bbc.  we will have to see what happens after the previous (autumn) tests but when i look at the current squad i definitely feel there is a place there for me.  healey  who has also played both half-back positions and full-back during his career  has reverted to the wing  where he won most of his england caps. after recovering from a trapped nerve in his back sustained at the end of september  the 31-year-old is relishing his role in the tigers revival.  i had six weeks out but fortunately i have resumed the sort of form i had before   he said.   i am basically playing where it best suits leicester. obviously i can play scrum-half  fly-half or full-back at a moment s notice.  but playing on the wing actually gives me a bigger free role to come in where i am not expected and influence things.  that has been apparent in parts one and two of the wasps-leicester trilogy in recent weeks. first  healey came off his flank with an angled run to score an injury-time try that earned the tigers a 17-17 draw in their premiership meeting on 21 november. then  in the first of their heineken cup double header last sunday  healey slotted in at stand-off and delivered a superb cross-kick for martin corry to score the tigers  third try.  i caught  cozza s  eye a couple of phases before that and was hoping to get it to him on the full  but fortunately even with the bounce he managed to score   healey recalled.  healey  twice a heineken cup winner  believes last sunday s match was  up there  with some of the biggest club contests he has played in.  it was a very intense occasion and a very destructive game   he recalled.  there was not a huge amount of rugby played but it was a great game to be involved in.  after about 15 minutes i thought we might stride away with it but wasps really came back into it and in the last couple of minutes it could have gone either way.   the same outcome this sunday would put leicester in pole position to top their heineken pool with a home game against biarritz and away trip to calvisano to come. but healey insists the tigers must summon the same desire if they are to deliver the knockout blow in what has been dubbed  rugby s version of rocky ii .  there was a lot of satisfaction in the dressing room aftewards but it is really only a case of a job half done   he added.  it was the first of a two-leg trip and if we lose at welford road it will negate all the positives we can take from result.  i think it came down to who wanted it more and in the end i think we did. we have got to show the same desire again this week.,healey target england comeback leicest wing austin healey hope use sunday return heineken cup clash wasp springboard england recal six nation healey cap prior world cup good form tiger resurg season definit still ambit play england healey told bbc see happen previou autumn test look current squad definit feel place healey also play halfback posit fullback career revert wing england cap recov trap nerv back sustain end septemb yearold relish role tiger reviv six week fortun resum sort form say basic play best suit leicest obvious play scrumhalf flyhalf fullback moment notic play wing actual give big free role come expect influenc thing appar part one two waspsleicest trilog recent week first healey come flank angl run score injurytim tri earn tiger draw premiership meet novemb first heineken cup doubl header last sunday healey slot standoff deliv superb crosskick martin corri score tiger third tri caught cozza eye coupl phase hope get full fortun even bounc manag score healey recal healey twice heineken cup winner believ last sunday match big club contest play intens occas destruct game recal huge amount rugbi play great game involv minut thought might stride away wasp realli come back last coupl minut could go either way outcom sunday would put leicest pole posit top heineken pool home game biarritz away trip calvisano come healey insist tiger must summon desir deliv knockout blow dub rugbi version rocki ii lot satisfact dress room afteward realli case job half do ad first twoleg trip lose welford road negat posit take result think come want end think get show desir week
234,1850,howard rebuts asylum criticisms tory leader michael howard has gone on the offensive in response to people questioning how a son of immigrants can propose asylum quotas.  mr howard  whose parents fled the nazi threat to come to the uk  says the claim would mean no-one from an immigrant family could become premier. his comments come in a bbc documentary called  no more mr nasty . tv presenter anne robinson said as home secretary he gave the impression he would  like to kick your cat . ms robinson  a friend of the tory leader  also revealed that as a cambridge student mr howard was  much loved by women and he was a courteous and kind and rather dashing lover  - although she denied having personal experience.  i wasn t at cambridge - and it s not personal experience - but i know people who were.   documentary maker michael cockerell was given behind-the-scenes access to mr howard for his film portrait. the tory leader was asked about to respond to people who said that if there had there been a quota on immigration and asylum in the 1930s  his parents might not have been allowed into the country.  he replies:  what is the inference of that   that if you reach the view that you need to control immigration in the interests of the country you re not allowed to put a view forward if you happen to be descended from immigrants   that seems to me an absolutely extraordinary proposition  it would certainly mean no one from immigrant parents could be prime minister.   ms robinson  who presents the weakest link tells cockerell that she despaired at his hardline image when he was home secretary in john major s government.  i used to have to sit on my hands because he d get on television and give a passable impression of someone who d like to kick your cat or would put your baby in prison if he cried. i mean it was very  very draconian.  the film shows mr howard laughing at rory bremner s impression of him as dracula  which he calls  good fun   apart from the serious falsehood of a comment suggesting he wants fewer black people in the uk. the film shows the private side of the tory leader watching television at home or playing table tennis with his wife  ex-model sandra. asked if she enjoys a game of ping pong she confesses:  yeah  it would be more enjoyable if i could win occasionally too  but otherwise it s quite fun.   former downing street communications chief alastair campbell  now working on labour s election campaign  says a  touchy-feely  image does not fit mr howard. he says tony blair was not worried by his opponents  early performance in their commons clashes because mr howard lacked a  big strategy   including on issues like iraq. the tory leader brands such criticisms as  absolutely rubbish   arguing that he has been consistent on his support for the war but critical of mr blair s failure to tell the truth on intelligence. former tory chancellor ken clarke says mr howard has a bigger problem changing perceptions of the tory party than his personal image. mr clarke says the party is improving and it is  conceivable  it could win the next election. but he adds:  it has got to change itself a bit and broaden its appeal.   -

235,1443,sir paul rocks super bowl crowds sir paul mccartney wowed fans with a live mini-concert at american football s super bowl - and avoided any janet jackson-style controversies.  the 62-year-old sang hey jude and other beatles songs in a 12-minute set at half-time during the game in florida. last year  jackson exposed a breast during a dance routine  causing outrage among millions of tv viewers and landing the cbs tv network a fine. sir paul  however  did nothing more racy than remove his jacket as he sang. organisers were widely considered to be playing it safe this year by booking 62-year-old sir paul for his second super bowl show.  three years ago  he was invited to perform at the first super bowl after the september 11 attacks and performed his specially-written song freedom. this time  he started off the show  at the alltel stadium in jacksonville  florida  with the beatles numbers drive my car and get back. he then performed a mellow version of live and let die  the james bond theme he recorded with the band wings. finally  he closed the show with a rousing version of hey jude. the former beatle resisted any temptation to refer to janet jackson s headline-grabbing performance last year  instead keeping banter between songs to a minimum in order to squeeze as much music as he could into his slot. the singer removed his black jacket halfway through the show - but any fans hoping for a second  nipple-gate  were to be disappointed as he kept his red sweatshirt on underneath.  earlier  the black eyed peas and alicia keys had provided the night s other high-profile entertainment by performing in a pre-game show. black eyed peas singer fergie was dressed in a tight orange top and purple hotpants  but nothing in her performance was likely to upset tv watchdogs. after the controversy last year - which saw cbs fined a record $550 000 (£292 000) by federal regulators - super bowl organisers had turned to producer don mischer to oversee this year s half-time show. his previous production credits included olympic opening and closing ceremonies. the super bowl is watched by an audience of 144.4 million in the us  with many of the people watching are said to tune in specifically to see the entertainment put on around the event. michael jackson  aerosmith  diana ross  gloria estefan and phil collins are among the stars who have previously graced the super bowl stage.,sir paul rock super bowl crowd sir paul mccartney wow fan live miniconcert american footbal super bowl avoid janet jacksonstyl controversi yearold sang hey jude beatl song minut set halftim game florida last year jackson expo breast danc routin caus outrag among million tv viewer land cb tv network fine sir paul howev noth raci remov jacket sang organis wide consid play safe year book yearold sir paul second super bowl show three year ago invit perform first super bowl septemb attack perform speciallywritten song freedom time start show alltel stadium jacksonvil florida beatl number drive car get back perform mellow version live let die jame bond theme record band wing final close show rous version hey jude former beatl resist temptat refer janet jackson headlinegrab perform last year instead keep banter song minimum order squeez much music could slot singer remov black jacket halfway show fan hope second nippleg disappoint kept red sweatshirt underneath earlier black eye pea alicia key provid night highprofil entertain perform pregam show black eye pea singer fergi dress tight orang top purpl hotpant noth perform like upset tv watchdog controversi last year saw cb fine record £ feder regul super bowl organis turn produc mischer overse year halftim show previou product credit includ olymp open close ceremoni super bowl watch audienc million u mani peopl watch say tune specif see entertain put around event michael jackson aerosmith diana ross gloria estefan phil collin among star previous grace super bowl stage
236,924,deutsche attacks yukos case german investment bank deutsche bank has challenged the right of yukos to claim bankruptcy protection in the us.  in a court filing on tuesday  it said the russian oil giant has few texas ties beyond bank accounts and a texas-based finance chief. deutsche bank claimed yukos had artificially manufactured a legal case to stop the sale of its main asset. it had wanted to help fund gazprom s plans for a $10bn (£5.18bn) bid for yukos unit yuganskneftegas.  deutsche bank would have earned large fees from the deal  which could not be carried out because us chapter 11 bankruptcy rules made the kremlin s auction of yuganskneftegas on 19 december illegal under us law.  but the us bankruptcy court judge in texas granted yukos an injunction that barred gazprom and its lenders from taking part. yuganskneftegas will ultimately end up with gazprom. the winning bidder at the auction was a previously unknown firm  baikal finance group  which was snapped up days later by rosneft  a russian oil firm that is in the process of merging with gazprom. the effect of these transactions is to renationalise yuganskneftegas. deutsche bank contends yukos filed for bankruptcy earlier this month in texas in a desperate and unsuccessful bid to stave off the 19 december auction of its top unit by the russian government  which was in a tax dispute with yukos.   this blatant attempt to artificially manufacture a basis for jurisdiction constitutes cause to dismiss this case   deutsche bank said in its court filing. mike lake  a spokesman for yukos  lawyers  said on tuesday that the company stands by its legal action. yukos is confident of its right to us bankruptcy protection  and  we are prepared to be back in court defending that position again   he said. yukos has said it intends to seek $20bn in damages from the buyer of yuganskneftegas once the sale finally goes through. in its filing  deutsche bank said houston was  a jurisdiction in which yukos owns no real or personal property and conducts no business operations.   it also said the us bankruptcy court should not become involved in  a tax dispute between the federation and one of its corporate citizens . it suggested the european court or an international arbitration tribunal were more appropriate jurisdictions for the legal fight between russia and yukos. the next hearing in the bankruptcy is expected on 6 january. analysts believe the tax dispute between the russian government and yukos is partly driven by russian president vladimir putin s hostility hostility to the political ambitions of ex-yukos boss mikhail khordokovsky. mr khodorkovsky is in jail  and on trial for fraud and tax evasion.,deutsch attack yuko case german invest bank deutsch bank challeng right yuko claim bankruptci protect u court file tuesday say russian oil giant texa tie beyond bank account texasbas financ chief deutsch bank claim yuko artifici manufactur legal case stop sale main asset want help fund gazprom plan bn £bn bid yuko unit yuganskneftega deutsch bank would earn larg fee deal could carri u chapter bankruptci rule make kremlin auction yuganskneftega decemb illeg u law u bankruptci court judg texa grant yuko injunct bar gazprom lender take part yuganskneftega ultim end gazprom win bidder auction previous unknown firm baikal financ group snap day later rosneft russian oil firm process merg gazprom effect transact renationalis yuganskneftega deutsch bank contend yuko file bankruptci earlier month texa desper unsuccess bid stave decemb auction top unit russian govern tax disput yuko blatant attempt artifici manufactur basi jurisdict constitut caus dismiss case deutsch bank say court file mike lake spokesman yuko lawyer say tuesday compani stand legal action yuko confid right u bankruptci protect prepar back court defend posit say yuko say intend seek bn damag buyer yuganskneftega sale final goe file deutsch bank say houston jurisdict yuko own real person properti conduct busi oper also say u bankruptci court becom involv tax disput feder one corpor citizen suggest european court intern arbitr tribun appropri jurisdict legal fight russia yuko next hear bankruptci expect januari analyst believ tax disput russian govern yuko partli driven russian presid vladimir putin hostil hostil polit ambit exyuko bos mikhail khordokovski mr khodorkovski jail trial fraud tax evas
237,2001,oil companies get russian setback international oil and mining companies have reacted cautiously to russia s decision to bar foreign firms from natural resource tenders in 2005.  us oil giant exxon said it did not plan to take part in a new tender on a project for which it had previously signed a preliminary agreement. miner highland gold said it regretted any limit on privatisation while bp  a big investor  declined to comment. only firms at least 51% russian-owned will be permitted to bid.  the federal natural resources agency said  the government is interested in letting russian companies develop strategic resources . the foreign ownership issue will be dealt with according to russia s competition law  natural resources minister yuri trutnev was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency. no further details were given  with mr trutnev suggesting that russia may decide on a case-by-case basis. observers said that the move may represent a shift in policy  as the administration of vladimir putin puts the protection of national interests above free market dynamics. russia recently wrested back control of a large chunk of its oil industry from stock-market listed company yukos  a move that prompted calls of outrage from many investors.  analysts warned that it was still too early to draw too many conclusions from this new set of proposals.  companies echoed this sentiment  saying that they would require more information before ringing the alarm bells.  it s not good. but it is very understandable   said al breach  an economist at ubs brunswick.  but if the investment climate is stable - that s much more important.  foreigners of course would like to have free entry but... this is not the end of the world.  a number of other nations  including mexico  saudi arabia and kuwait  protect their national resources from foreign firms. what has surprised observers is that since the collapse of communism russia has been courting foreign investment.  bp spent $7.5bn to create russian-registered oil company tnk-bp  and has a partnership to develop the sakhalin 5 petroleum field with state-owned rosneft. exxon  the world s largest oil company  has signed preliminary agreements to develop the sakhalin 3 field. company spokesman glenn waller said exxon still considered the deal valid  despite russia inviting new offers for the land block. according to mr waller  exxon  were not planning to bid at a new tender anyway .  we regret the ministry has taken such a decision   said ivan kulakov  deputy chairman of highland gold - a mining firm that has the motto  bringing russia s gold to market .  it would be a shame if that has a negative impact on the investment climate.  other firms that have been linked with investment in russia include france s total  the us-based chevrontexaco  and miner barrick gold.,oil compani get russian setback intern oil mine compani react cautious russia decis bar foreign firm natur resourc tender u oil giant exxon say plan take part new tender project previous sign preliminari agreement miner highland gold say regret limit privatis bp big investor declin comment firm least russianown permit bid feder natur resourc agenc say govern interest let russian compani develop strateg resourc foreign ownership issu dealt accord russia competit law natur resourc minist yuri trutnev quot say interfax news agenc detail give mr trutnev suggest russia may decid casebycas basi observ say move may repres shift polici administr vladimir putin put protect nation interest free market dynam russia recent wrest back control larg chunk oil industri stockmarket list compani yuko move prompt call outrag mani investor analyst warn still earli draw mani conclus new set propos compani echo sentiment say would requir inform ring alarm bell good understand say al breach economist ub brunswick invest climat stabl much import foreign cours would like free entri end world number nation includ mexico saudi arabia kuwait protect nation resourc foreign firm surpris observ sinc collaps commun russia court foreign invest bp spent bn creat russianregist oil compani tnkbp partnership develop sakhalin petroleum field stateown rosneft exxon world large oil compani sign preliminari agreement develop sakhalin field compani spokesman glenn waller say exxon still consid deal valid despit russia invit new offer land block accord mr waller exxon plan bid new tender anyway regret ministri take decis say ivan kulakov deputi chairman highland gold mine firm motto bring russia gold market would shame neg impact invest climat firm link invest russia includ franc total usbas chevrontexaco miner barrick gold
238,1362,executive trio leave aer lingus three senior executives of ireland s state-owned airline  aer lingus  are set to leave early on 28 january after accusations of a conflict of interest.  the trio are chief executive willie walsh  chief financial officer brian dunne and chief operations officer seamus kearney. the three have refused to confirm reports they plan to launch a private airline in competition with aer lingus. they announced in november they would quit in may  but did not give a reason. that decision had followed an announcement by irish prime minister bertie ahern - who is still considering the future of the airline - which ruled out a proposed management buy-out of aer lingus. mr walsh denied they had been forced out early because of the reports claiming they were set to launch a competitor airline.   what i do after i leave aer lingus is still too early to say   mr walsh told ap news agency on wednesday.  i have opportunities open to me. brian and seamus are in the equally fortunate position.  he said he had received more than 40 business proposals  mostly aviation-related  since the trio announced their resignations two months ago. mr walsh said there was no conflict of interest  and  if he was to launch a rival airline or join an existing competitor   this thing happens in every business .  there s absolutely no question of a conflict of interest. i ve been completely focused on my responsibilities at aer lingus   he told ap.  this week opposition politicians had called on the irish government to make an urgent decision on the future of the airline. on wednesday irish transport minister martin cullen said in a statement:  a conflict of interest cannot  should not and will not be allowed to arise between their current roles at aer lingus and their future career intentions.  last friday the minister had announced he was to advertise for three senior executives for aer lingus. mr walsh  who took charge in 2000  and his team have earned praise for turning aer lingus around  by cutting air fares and staff  and re-positioning it as a low-fare airline to rival ryanair. the company is 85% owned by the government and 15% by its staff.,execut trio leav aer lingu three senior execut ireland stateown airlin aer lingu set leav earli januari accus conflict interest trio chief execut willi walsh chief financi offic brian dunn chief oper offic seamu kearney three refus confirm report plan launch privat airlin competit aer lingu announc novemb would quit may give reason decis follow announc irish prime minist berti ahern still consid futur airlin rule propos manag buyout aer lingu mr walsh deni forc earli report claim set launch competitor airlin leav aer lingu still earli say mr walsh told ap news agenc wednesday opportun open brian seamu equal fortun posit say receiv busi propos mostli aviationrel sinc trio announc resign two month ago mr walsh say conflict interest launch rival airlin join exist competitor thing happen everi busi absolut question conflict interest complet focus respons aer lingu told ap week opposit politician call irish govern make urgent decis futur airlin wednesday irish transport minist martin cullen say statement conflict interest allow aris current role aer lingu futur career intent last friday minist announc advertis three senior execut aer lingu mr walsh take charg team earn prais turn aer lingu around cut air fare staff reposit lowfar airlin rival ryanair compani own govern staff
239,1901,mcilroy aiming for madrid title northern ireland man james mcilroy is confident he can win his first major title at this weekend s spar european indoor championships in madrid.  the 28-year-old has been in great form in recent weeks and will go in as one of the 800 metres favourites.  i believe after my wins abroad and in our trial race in sheffield  i can run my race from the front  back or middle   said mcilroy. new coach tony lester has helped get mcilroy s career back on track. the 28-year-old 800 metres runner has not always matched his promise with performances but believes his decision to change coaches and move base will bring the rewards. mcilroy now lives in windsor and feels his career has been transformed by the no-nonsense leadership style of former army sergeant lester. lester is better known for his work with 400m runners roger black and mark richardson in the past but under his guidance mcilroy has secured five wins this indoor season.  mcilroy now claims he is in his best shape since finishing fourth for ireland at the outdoor european championships in 1998.  that was my last decent year   said mcilroy  who temporarily retired last august before returning to the sport under lester s shrewd guidance.  before  every race was like trying to climb mount everest and i now know you can t do it on your own.  trying to succeed saw me sometimes standing half-dead and terrified on the starting line  which became a bit too much.  mcilroy  who was compared to the likes of sebastian coe  steve cram and steve ovett in his younger days  is now competing without the benefit of national lottery funding. that situation could change if he maintains his current form and repeats the world-class times he produced in the 800m and 1000m at major races in erfurt and stuttgart earlier this season. russian dmitriy bogdanov won at the same madrid venue last week and then claimed the european championship race would be between himself  dutchman arnoud okken and antonio reina of spain but mcilroy is unfazed.  he admitted:  he looked quite good in his win and fair enough everyone has the right to their own opinion.  i never write myself off and let s face it  i haven t or looked like being beaten this season.  and mcilroy  whose time of one minute 46.68seconds in erfurt elevated him to sixth place on the uk all-time list  is also already looking beyond madrid. he said:  i ve been much more focused this year about my career and having such a good team around me has been very important.  ultimately of course  this weekend is a means to an end and that is getting prepared for the summer s world championships.  that ambition has meant that i ve had only two nights out since last august. the rest of my time has seen me just concentrating on rebuilding my career.,mcilroy aim madrid titl northern ireland man jame mcilroy confid win first major titl weekend spar european indoor championship madrid yearold great form recent week go one metr favourit believ win abroad trial race sheffield run race front back middl say mcilroy new coach toni lester help get mcilroy career back track yearold metr runner alway match promis perform believ decis chang coach move base bring reward mcilroy live windsor feel career transform nononsens leadership style former armi sergeant lester lester well know work m runner roger black mark richardson past guidanc mcilroy secur five win indoor season mcilroy claim best shape sinc finish fourth ireland outdoor european championship last decent year say mcilroy temporarili retir last august return sport lester shrewd guidanc everi race like tri climb mount everest know tri succeed saw sometim stand halfdead terrifi start line becam bit much mcilroy compar like sebastian coe steve cram steve ovett young day compet without benefit nation lotteri fund situat could chang maintain current form repeat worldclass time produc m m major race erfurt stuttgart earlier season russian dmitriy bogdanov madrid venu last week claim european championship race would dutchman arnoud okken antonio reina spain mcilroy unfaz admit look quit good win fair enough everyon right opinion never write let face look like beaten season mcilroy whose time one minut second erfurt elev sixth place uk alltim list also alreadi look beyond madrid say much focus year career good team around import ultim cours weekend mean end get prepar summer world championship ambit meant two night sinc last august rest time see concentr rebuild career
240,825,prime minister s questions so who  if anyone  is playing politics with the security of the nation   michael howard has no doubt it is the prime minister who  he claims  is  ramming  through parliament the controversial new anti-terror measures without proper debate. he didn t say so  but the tories believe the prime minister is playing the fear card on this one so he can look tough in the run up to the general election and they believe tony blair is using the issue to suggest the tories are soft on terrorism. why on earth will the prime minister not simply take up the tories  offer to extend the existing powers temporarily to allow proper parliamentary debate of the laws  he demanded. the prime minister claims this is the clearest indication that it is the tories who are playing politics with the issue by attempting to score cheap political points in parliament. is not the opposition against to the proposed laws  in principle   in which case delaying a decision for further debate would be pointless   what this is really about  believes mr blair  is the tories spotting an opportunity to embarrass  maybe even defeat the government. and that is more important to them than national security. liberal democrat leader charles kennedy avoided suggesting anyone was playing politics with the issue. he preferred to state that  as with other issues like id cards  the government s immediate instinct was authoritarian.  as is his habit nowadays  the prime minister was less rough with mr kennedy than he had been with mr howard - he prefers a more exasperated tone suggesting he believes the lib dems have  once again  just missed the point. apart from all that  it was electioneering as usual. the very first question to the prime minister from derby north s bob laxton asked him  in effect  if he would carry on the excellent policy of pouring more resources into schools. later birmingham s sion simon even went so far as to suggest the tories were such a shower that we should have the general election now. the prime minister almost blushed. this was not the appropriate place to announce election day  he stammered. but can anyone be in any doubt that that announcement is just days away - an announcement coming in the week beginning 4 april for an election on 5 may is where the big money is in the commons. and perhaps that simple fact alone means everyone is seen to be playing politics with just about everything at the moment.,prime minist question anyon play polit secur nation michael howard doubt prime minist claim ram parliament controversi new antiterror measur without proper debat say torus believ prime minist play fear card one look tough run gener elect believ toni blair use issu suggest torus soft terror earth prime minist simpli take torus offer extend exist power temporarili allow proper parliamentari debat law demand prime minist claim clearest indic torus play polit issu attempt score cheap polit point parliament opposit propos law principl case delay decis debat would pointless realli believ mr blair torus spot opportun embarrass mayb even defeat govern import nation secur liber democrat leader charl kennedi avoid suggest anyon play polit issu prefer state issu like id card govern immedi instinct authoritarian habit nowaday prime minist less rough mr kennedi mr howard prefer exasper tone suggest believ lib dem miss point apart election usual first question prime minist derbi north bob laxton ask effect would carri excel polici pour resourc school later birmingham sion simon even go far suggest torus shower gener elect prime minist almost blush appropri place announc elect day stammer anyon doubt announc day away announc come week begin april elect may big money common perhap simpl fact alon mean everyon see play polit everyth moment
241,1263,defiant hunts put ban to the test thousands of hunt supporters have been out on the first day of hunting in england and wales after the ban on hunting with dogs came into force.  the countryside alliance called on hunt supporters to meet as normal  but vowed to stay within the law. although hunting with dogs is now a criminal offence  exercising hounds  chasing a scent trail and flushing out foxes to be shot are still legal. one anti-hunt protester was taken to hospital after a violent clash in kent.  the man suffered facial injuries after an incident involving a group of men at the end of the east kent hunt  near ashford. in wiltshire  police arrested four men under the new law suspected of hunting with dogs. the group  from south wales and ireland  have been released on bail but police say they may face prosecution under new poaching laws.  it is believed more than 270 hunts went out on saturday  just one day after the ban came in.  they were greeted by big crowds in many areas of the country  with actor jeremy irons and former minister kate hoey among the supporters. anti-hunt groups - such as the league against cruel sports - deployed 100 monitors at hunts to check for illegal activity.  mike hobday  from the league  said video evidence of the law being broken was to be passed onto police.  our evidence suggests that most hunts did operate within the law  many meeting and promptly going home and others peacefully exercising their hounds or drag hunting.  however  we have received reports of what we believe is clearly illegal activity by a number of hunts across britain.  bbc correspondent simon hall at postbridge on dartmoor in the west country said 2 000 people had turned out to welcome the hunt.  and the bbc s sarah mukherjee  with the beaufort hunt in badminton  gloucestershire said several hundred people had gathered on foot to see the hunt  with 150 on horseback. tom heap  bbc rural affairs correspondent  said it appeared that hunstman had  for now  been sticking to the new rules. and while there was big turnout in support of the hunts on saturday  he said it remains to be seen if the level of backing can be maintained.  before riding out with the hunt  former minister kate hoey told crowds:  we will prevail and this law will have to be overturned.  judith moritz  in melton mowbray  said anti-hunt activists were out to monitor the four hunts operating in that part of leicestershire  but were outnumbered by large crowds of followers. the countryside alliance said the meets would show the new law was  impossibly difficult to determine  and open to different interpretations.  chief executive simon hart said:  there has been hunting in england for 700 years. this [ban] may take two or three years  perhaps two or three months  to unpick.  it will be nothing more than a temporary break in normal service  as broadcasters say.  conservative family spokeswoman theresa may said if the party was in government again it would make sure the law was repealed. suffolk chief constable alastair mcwhirter  the association of chief police officers  spokesman on rural policing  told the bbc the law would be enforced  although the police would not break up hunts. the attorney general lord goldsmith has so far not issued any instructions to police on how they should deal with any hunters who do violate the law. he said he would consult the director of public prosecutions and the police  in the near future  to decide what measures to take on hunting prosecutions.,defiant hunt put ban test thousand hunt support first day hunt england wale ban hunt dog come forc countrysid allianc call hunt support meet normal vow stay within law although hunt dog crimin offenc exercis hound chase scent trail flush fox shot still legal one antihunt protest take hospit violent clash kent man suffer facial injuri incid involv group men end east kent hunt near ashford wiltshir polic arrest four men new law suspect hunt dog group south wale ireland releas bail polic say may face prosecut new poach law believ hunt go saturday one day ban come greet big crowd mani area countri actor jeremi iron former minist kate hoey among support antihunt group leagu cruel sport deploy monitor hunt check illeg activ mike hobday leagu say video evid law broken pas onto polic evid suggest hunt oper within law mani meet promptli go home other peac exercis hound drag hunt howev receiv report believ clearli illeg activ number hunt across britain bbc correspond simon hall postbridg dartmoor west countri say peopl turn welcom hunt bbc sarah mukherje beaufort hunt badminton gloucestershir say sever hundr peopl gather foot see hunt horseback tom heap bbc rural affair correspond say appear hunstman stick new rule big turnout support hunt saturday say remain see level back maintain ride hunt former minist kate hoey told crowd prevail law overturn judith moritz melton mowbray say antihunt activist monitor four hunt oper part leicestershir outnumb larg crowd follow countrysid allianc say meet would show new law imposs difficult determin open differ interpret chief execut simon hart say hunt england year ban may take two three year perhap two three month unpick noth temporari break normal servic broadcast say conserv famili spokeswoman theresa may say parti govern would make sure law repeal suffolk chief constabl alastair mcwhirter associ chief polic offic spokesman rural polic told bbc law would enforc although polic would break hunt attorney gener lord goldsmith far issu instruct polic deal hunter violat law say would consult director public prosecut polic near futur decid measur take hunt prosecut

243,1802,continental  may run out of cash  shares in continental airlines have tumbled after the firm warned it could run out of cash.  in a filing to us regulators the airline warned of  inadequate liquidity  if it fails to reduce wage costs by $500m by the end of february. continental also said that  if it did not make any cuts  it expects to lose  hundreds of millions of dollars  in 2005 in current market conditions. failure to make cutbacks may also push it to reduce its fleet  the group said. shares in the fifth biggest us carrier had fallen 6.87% on the news to $10.44 by 1830 gmt.  without the reduction in wage and benefit costs and a reasonable prospect of future profitability  we believe that our ability to raise additional money through financings would be uncertain   continental said in its filing to the us securities and exchange commission (sec).  airlines have faced tough conditions in recent years  amid terrorism fears since the 11 september world trade centre attack in 2001. but despite passengers returning to the skies  record-high fuel costs and fare wars prompted by competition from low cost carriers have taken their toll. houston-based continental now has debt and pension payments of nearly $984m which it must pay off this year. the company has been working to streamline its operations - and has managed to save $1.1bn in costs without cutting jobs. two weeks  ago the group also announced it would be able to shave a further $48m a year from its costs with changes to wage and benefits for most of its us-based management and clerical staff.,continent may run cash share continent airlin tumbl firm warn could run cash file u regul airlin warn inadequ liquid fail reduc wage cost m end februari continent also say make cut expect lose hundr million dollar current market condit failur make cutback may also push reduc fleet group say share fifth big u carrier fall news gmt without reduct wage benefit cost reason prospect futur profit believ abil rais addit money financ would uncertain continent say file u secur exchang commiss sec airlin face tough condit recent year amid terror fear sinc septemb world trade centr attack despit passeng return sky recordhigh fuel cost fare war prompt competit low cost carrier take toll houstonbas continent debt pension payment nearli m must pay year compani work streamlin oper manag save bn cost without cut job two week ago group also announc would abl shave m year cost chang wage benefit usbas manag cleric staff
244,1152,khodorkovsky quits yukos shares jailed tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky has transferred his controlling stake in oil giant yukos to a business partner.  mr khodorkovsky handed over his entire 59.5% stake in holding company group menatep - which controls yukos - to leonid nevzlin. a close ally of the ex-yukos boss  mr nevzlin is currently based in israel. mr khodorkovsky handed over his stake after the forced sale of yukos  core oil production unit  yuganskneftegaz to pay a giant tax bill.  yuganskneftegaz was sold off at auction in december last year  eventually falling into the hands of state oil firm rosneft in a deal worth $9.4bn (£5bn).  since the sale of yuganskneftegaz  i have been delivered of (all) responsibility for the business that remains and the group s money as a whole   mr khodorkovsky said.  it is all over. as before  i see my future in public activity to build a civil society in russia.  mr nevzlin is yukos  largest shareholder but is living in self-imposed exile in israel. yuganskneftegaz pumps around 1 million barrels of oil a day. it was sold by the russian authorities to recover government tax claims against yukos totalling over $27bn. previously considered to be russia s richest man  with an estimated fortune of $15bn  mr khodorkovsky is currently on trial for fraud and tax evasion following his arrest in october 2003. however  the charges are widely seen as politically motivated and part of a drive by russian president vladimir putin to rein in the country s super-rich business leaders  the so-called oligarchs. it is also believed that mr khodorkovsky was particularly targeted because he had started to bankroll political opponents of mr putin.,khodorkovski quit yuko share jail tycoon mikhail khodorkovski transfer control stake oil giant yuko busi partner mr khodorkovski hand entir stake hold compani group menatep control yuko leonid nevzlin close alli exyuko bos mr nevzlin current base israel mr khodorkovski hand stake forc sale yuko core oil product unit yuganskneftegaz pay giant tax bill yuganskneftegaz sell auction decemb last year eventu fall hand state oil firm rosneft deal worth bn £bn sinc sale yuganskneftegaz deliv respons busi remain group money whole mr khodorkovski say see futur public activ build civil societi russia mr nevzlin yuko large sharehold live selfimpos exil israel yuganskneftegaz pump around million barrel oil day sell russian author recov govern tax claim yuko total bn previous consid russia richest man estim fortun bn mr khodorkovski current trial fraud tax evas follow arrest octob howev charg wide see polit motiv part drive russian presid vladimir putin rein countri superrich busi leader socal oligarch also believ mr khodorkovski particularli target start bankrol polit oppon mr putin

247,2149,standard life concern at lse bid standard life is the latest shareholder in deutsche boerse to express concern at the german stock market operator s plans to buy the london stock exchange.  it said deutsche boerse had to show why its planned £1.35bn ($2.5bn) offer for the lse was good for shareholder value. reports say standard life  which owns a 1% stake in deutsche boerse  may seek a shareholder vote on the issue. fellow shareholders us-based hedge fund atticus capital and uk-based tci fund management have also expressed doubts.  deutsche boerse s supervisory board has approved the possible takeover of the lse despite the signs of opposition from investors.  the onus is on deutsche boerse s management to demonstrate why the purchase of the lse creates more value for shareholders than other strategies  such as a buyback   said richard moffat  investment director of uk equities at standard life investments. atticus capital  holding 2% of deutsche boerse  wants it to buy back its own shares rather than buy the lse. and tci which holds about 5%  has made a request for an extraordinary shareholders meeting to be held to vote on replacing the company s entire supervisory board. it has also demanded that shareholders be consulted about the proposed acquisition  and whether the operator of the frankfurt stock exchange should return $500m (£266m) to shareholders instead.  in december  deutsche boerse  which also owns the derivatives market eurex and the clearing firm clearstream  put an informal offer of 530 pence per lse share on the table. however  the lse said the cash offer  undervalued  both its own business and the benefits of such a tie-up. since then an improved offer from deutsche boerse has been anticipated as its management has continued talks with lse chief executive clara furse. but the london exchange is also holding talks with deutsche boerse s rival euronext  which operates the amsterdam  brussels  lisbon and paris exchanges  as well as london-based international derivatives market liffe.,standard life concern lse bid standard life late sharehold deutsch boer express concern german stock market oper plan buy london stock exchang say deutsch boer show plan £bn bn offer lse good sharehold valu report say standard life own stake deutsch boer may seek sharehold vote issu fellow sharehold usbas hedg fund atticu capit ukbas tci fund manag also express doubt deutsch boer supervisori board approv possibl takeov lse despit sign opposit investor onu deutsch boer manag demonstr purchas lse creat valu sharehold strategi buyback say richard moffat invest director uk equiti standard life invest atticu capit hold deutsch boer want buy back share rather buy lse tci hold make request extraordinari sharehold meet held vote replac compani entir supervisori board also demand sharehold consult propos acquisit whether oper frankfurt stock exchang return m £m sharehold instead decemb deutsch boer also own deriv market eurex clear firm clearstream put inform offer penc per lse share tabl howev lse say cash offer undervalu busi benefit tieup sinc improv offer deutsch boer anticip manag continu talk lse chief execut clara fur london exchang also hold talk deutsch boer rival euronext oper amsterdam brussel lisbon pari exchang well londonbas intern deriv market liff

249,123,safety alert as gm recalls cars the world s biggest carmaker general motors (gm) is recalling nearly 200 000 vehicles in the us on safety grounds  according to federal regulators.  the national highway traffic safety administration (nhtsa) said the largest recall involves 155 465 pickups  vans and sports utility vehicles (suvs). this is because of possible malfunctions with the braking systems. the affected vehicles in the product recall are from the 2004 and 2005 model years  gm said. those vehicles with potential faults are the chevrolet avalanche  express  kodiak  silverade and suburban; the gmc savana  sierra and yukon.  the nhtsa said a pressure accumulator in the braking system could crack during normal driving and fragments could injure people if the hood was open. this could allow hydraulic fluid to leak  which could make it harder to brake or steer and could cause a crash  it warned. gm is also recalling 19 924 cadillac xlr coupes  srx suvs and pontiac grand prix sedans from the 2004 model year. this is because the accelerator pedal may not work properly in extremely cold temperatures  requiring more braking. in addition  the car giant is calling back 17 815 buick raniers  chevrolet trailblazers  gmc envoys and isuzu ascenders from the 2005 model years because the windshield is not properly fitted and could fall out in a crash. however  gm stressed that it did not know of any injuries related to the problems. news of the recall follows an announcement last month that gm expects earnings this year be lower than in 2004. the world s biggest car maker is grappling with losses in its european business  weak us sales and now a product recall. in january  gm said higher healthcare costs in north america  and lower profits at its financial services subsidiary would hurt its performance in 2005.,safeti alert gm recal car world big carmak gener motor gm recal nearli vehicl u safeti ground accord feder regul nation highway traffic safeti administr nhtsa say large recal involv pickup van sport util vehicl suv possibl malfunct brake system affect vehicl product recal model year gm say vehicl potenti fault chevrolet avalanch express kodiak silverad suburban gmc savana sierra yukon nhtsa say pressur accumul brake system could crack normal drive fragment could injur peopl hood open could allow hydraul fluid leak could make harder brake steer could caus crash warn gm also recal cadillac xlr coup srx suv pontiac grand prix sedan model year acceler pedal may work properli extrem cold temperatur requir brake addit car giant call back buick ranier chevrolet trailblaz gmc envoy isuzu ascend model year windshield properli fit could fall crash howev gm stress know injuri relat problem news recal follow announc last month gm expect earn year low world big car maker grappl loss european busi weak u sale product recal januari gm say high healthcar cost north america low profit financi servic subsidiari would hurt perform

254,543,act on detention ruling  uk urged the government must act quickly on the law lords  ruling that detention of foreign terror suspects without trial is unlawful  mary robinson has said.  the former un commissioner for human rights and irish president told radio 4 s today the government s response would be scrutinised internationally.  it would be very troubling if the government did not accept the judgement and then work within it   she said. home secretary charles clarke has said detainees will not be freed at present. speaking to parliament on his first day in office as home secretary following david blunkett s resignation  mr clarke said:  i will be asking parliament to renew this legislation in the new year.  in the meantime  we will be studying the judgement carefully to see whether it is possible to modify our legislation to address the concerns raised by the house of lords.   mrs robinson said the law lords  ruling was  in line with international legal opinion  and praised their  very decisive  eight to one majority.  what the law lords did was acknowledge the role of the government  but say that there had been a disproportionate use  that it amounted to executive detention and it was discriminatory because it didn t apply to british citizens   she said.  mrs robinson warned that a lack of action by the british government could lead to further action in legal arenas such as the european court of human rights in strasbourg.  if the government were not to accept this ruling then there is further redress  including possible damages for the individuals who could claim that the government either was tardy or was resisting the implications of the judgement of the law lords.  she said a meeting of the club of madrid - a group of former world leaders - to be held in the spanish capital on the march anniversary of the train bombings there would probably discuss the ruling and its implications.  i have no doubt that this judgement will be looked at  both as a very positive step in clarifying the law and restating the fundamental principles  but also the response of the british government will be under quite a clear international scrutiny there.   the detainees took their case to the house of lords after the court of appeal backed the home office s powers to hold them without limit or charge. the government opted out of part of the european convention on human rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in anti-terrorism legislation in response to the 11 september attacks in the us. any foreign national suspected of links with terrorism can be detained or can opt to be deported. the law lords said the rules were incompatible with the european convention on human rights as they allowed detentions  in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status . the case was heard by a panel of nine law lords rather than the usual five because of the constitutional importance of the case.,act detent rule uk urg govern must act quickli law lord rule detent foreign terror suspect without trial unlaw mari robinson say former un commission human right irish presid told radio today govern respons would scrutinis intern would troubl govern accept judgement work within say home secretari charl clark say detaine freed present speak parliament first day offic home secretari follow david blunkett resign mr clark say ask parliament renew legisl new year meantim studi judgement care see whether possibl modifi legisl address concern rais hous lord mr robinson say law lord rule line intern legal opinion prais decis eight one major law lord acknowledg role govern say disproportion use amount execut detent discriminatori appli british citizen say mr robinson warn lack action british govern could lead action legal arena european court human right strasbourg govern accept rule redress includ possibl damag individu could claim govern either tardi resist implic judgement law lord say meet club madrid group former world leader held spanish capit march anniversari train bomb would probabl discus rule implic doubt judgement look posit step clarifi law restat fundament principl also respons british govern quit clear intern scrutini detaine take case hous lord court appeal back home offic power hold without limit charg govern opt part european convent human right concern right fair trial order bring antiterror legisl respons septemb attack u foreign nation suspect link terror detain opt deport law lord say rule incompat european convent human right allow detent way discrimin ground nation immigr statu case heard panel nine law lord rather usual five constitut import case
255,286,nissan names successor to ghosn nissan has named a lifetime employee to run its operations after carlos ghosn  its highly successful boss  takes charge at renault.  as chief operating officer  toshiyuki shiga will run nissan on a daily basis  although mr ghosn  who masterminded its recovery  will remain chief executive. mr ghosn is to become chairman and chief executive of renault  which owns 44% of the japanese carmaker  in april. mr ghosn transformed nissan into a fast-growing and profitable business.  mr shiga will nominally serve as mr ghosn s deputy. however  he will be nissan s most senior japan-based executive and will be in charge of the firm s global sales and marketing.  he is currently in charge of nissan s operations across asia and australasia and is credited with significantly improving its sales in china. he will inherit a strong legacy from mr ghosn  who has overseen a dramatic turnaround in nissan s fortunes in the past five years. dubbed  le cost killer  for pushing through huge cost cuts in previous jobs  mr ghosn reduced nissan s overheads by 20% and trimmed its workforce by about 200 000 after taking charge in 1999. these actions helped nissan turn a 684bn yen ($6.4bn) loss in 2000 into a 331bn yen ($2.7bn) profit the following year. during his tenure  nissan has increased its market share and made significant strides in key export markets. nissan aims to increase vehicle sales to more than four million by 2008  launching 28 new models in the process.  in his new job as renault chief executive  mr ghosn will devote 40% of his time to renault  40% to nissan and the rest to the group s activities in north america and other key markets.  mr ghosn said mr shiga s appointment would ensure a  seamless  transition in management.  i need a leadership team capable of accelerating the performance and delivery of results that has characterized nissan over the past six years   mr ghosn said.  i have full confidence in toshiyuki shiga and the new leadership team to help me implement the next chapter of nissan s growth.  nissan also announced a number of other management appointments with promotions for several younger executives.,nissan name successor ghosn nissan name lifetim employe run oper carlo ghosn highli success bos take charg renault chief oper offic toshiyuki shiga run nissan daili basi although mr ghosn mastermind recoveri remain chief execut mr ghosn becom chairman chief execut renault own japanes carmak april mr ghosn transform nissan fastgrow profit busi mr shiga nomin serv mr ghosn deputi howev nissan senior japanbas execut charg firm global sale market current charg nissan oper across asia australasia credit significantli improv sale china inherit strong legaci mr ghosn overseen dramat turnaround nissan fortun past five year dub le cost killer push huge cost cut previou job mr ghosn reduc nissan overhead trim workforc take charg action help nissan turn bn yen bn loss bn yen bn profit follow year tenur nissan increas market share make signific stride key export market nissan aim increas vehicl sale four million launch new model process new job renault chief execut mr ghosn devot time renault nissan rest group activ north america key market mr ghosn say mr shiga appoint would ensur seamless transit manag need leadership team capabl acceler perform deliveri result character nissan past six year mr ghosn say full confid toshiyuki shiga new leadership team help implement next chapter nissan growth nissan also announc number manag appoint promot sever young execut
256,2142,blogs take on the mainstream web logs or blogs are everywhere  with at least an estimated five million on the web and that number is set to grow.  these online diaries come in many shapes and styles  ranging from people willing to sharing their views  pictures and links  to companies interested in another way of reaching their customers. but this year the focus has been on blogs which cast a critical eye over news events  often writing about issues ignored by the big media or offering an eye-witness account of events. most blogs may have only a small readership  but communication experts say they have provided an avenue for people to have a say in the world of politics. the most well-known examples include iraqi salam pax s accounts of the us-led war  former iranian vice-president mohammad ali abtahi exclusive insight into the islamic republic s government  and the highs and lows of the recent us election campaign. there are already websites pulling together these first-hand reporting accounts heralded by blogs  like wikinews.com  launched last november.  the blogging movement has been building up for many years.  andrew nachison  director of the media center  a us-based think-tank that studies media  technology and society  highlights the us presidential race as a possible turning point for blogs.  you could look at that as a moment when audiences exercised a new form of power  to choose among many more sources of information than they have never had before   he says.  and blogs were a key part of that transformation.  among them were blogs carrying picture messages  saying  we are sorry  for george w bush s victory and the responses from his supporters. mr nachison argues blogs have become independent sources for images and ideas that circumvent traditional sources of news and information such as newspapers  tv and radio.  we have to acknowledge that in all of these cases  mainstream media actually plays a role in the discussion and the distribution of these ideas   he told the bbc news website.  but they followed the story  they didn t lead it.   some parts of the so-called traditional media have expressed concerns about this emerging competitor  raising questions about the journalistic value of blogs.  others  like the french newspaper le monde  have applied a different strategy  offering blogs as part of its content.  i don t think the mission and role of journalism is threatened. it is in transition  as society itself is in transition   says mr nachison. however  he agrees with other experts like the linguist and political analyst noam chomsky  that mainstream media has lost the traditional role of news gatekeeper.  the one-to-many road of traditional journalism  yes  it is threatened. and professional journalists need to acclimate themselves to an environment in which there are many more contributors to the discourse   says mr nachison.  the notion of a gatekeeper who filters and decides what s acceptable for public consumption and what isn t  that s gone forever.   with people now walking around with information devices in their pockets  like camera or video phones  we are going to see more instances of ordinary citizens breaking stories.   it seems unlikely that we will end up living in a planet where every human is a blogger.  but the current number of blogs is likely to keep on growing  in a web already overloaded with information. blog analysis firm technorati estimates the number of blogs in existence  the so-called blogosphere  has already exceeded five million  and is growing at exponential levels. tools such as google s blogger  movabletype and the recently launched beta version of msn spaces are making it easier to run a blog. us research think-tank pew internet & american life says a blog is created every 5.8 seconds  although less than 40% of the total are updated at least once every two months. but experts agree that the phenomenon  allowing individuals to publish  share ideas  exchange information  comment on current issues  post images or video on the web easily  is here to stay.  we are entering one era in which the technological infrastructure is creating a different context for how we tell our stories and how we communicate with each other   said mr nachison.  and there s going to be bad that comes with the good.,blog take

257,2130,strong dollar  call halts slide the us dollar s slide against the euro and yen has halted after us treasury secretary john snow said a strong dollar was  in america s interest .  but analysts said any gains are likely to be short-lived as problems with the us economy were still significant. they also pointed out that positive comments apart  president george w bush s administration had done little to stop the dollar s slide. a weak dollar helps boost exports and narrow the current account deficit. the dollar was trading at $1.2944 against the euro at 2100gmt  still close to the $1.3006 record level set on 10 november. against the japanese yen  it was trading at 105.28 yen  after hitting a seven-month low of 105.17 earlier in the day.  policy makers in europe have called the dollar s slide  brutal  and have blamed the strength of the euro for dampening economic growth. however  it is unclear whether ministers would issue a declaration aimed at curbing the euro s rise at a monthly meeting of eurozone ministers late on monday. higher growth in europe is regarded by us officials as a way the huge us current account deficit - that has been weighing on the dollar - could be reduced. mr snow who is currently in dublin at the start of a four-nation eu visit  has applauded ireland s introduction of lower taxes and deregulation which have helped boost growth.  the eurozone is growing below its potential. when a major part of the global economy is below potential there are negative consequences... for the citizens of those economies... and for their trading partners   he said. mr snow s comments may have helped shore up the dollar on monday  but he was careful to qualify his statement.   our basic policy  of course  is to let open  competitive markets set the values   he explained.  markets are driven by fundamentals and towards fundamentals.  us officials have also said that other economies need to grow  so the us is not the main global growth engine. economists say that the fundamentals  or key indicators  of the us economy are looking far from rosy. domestic consumer demand is cooling  and heavy spending by president bush has pushed the budget deficit to a record $427bn (£230bn). the current account deficit  meanwhile  hit a record $166bn in the second quarter of 2004. for many analysts  a weaker dollar is here to stay.  no end is in sight   said carsten fritsch  a strategist at commerzbank .  it is only a matter of time until the euro reaches $1.30.  some analysts maintain the us is secretly happy with a lower dollar which helps makes its exports cheaper in europe  thus boosting its economy.,strong dollar call halt slide u dollar slide euro yen halt u treasuri secretari john snow say strong dollar america interest analyst say gain like shortliv problem u economi still signific also point posit comment apart presid georg w bush administr do littl stop dollar slide weak dollar help boost export narrow current account deficit dollar trade euro gmt still close record level set novemb japanes yen trade yen hit sevenmonth low earlier day polici maker europ call dollar slide brutal blame strength euro dampen econom growth howev unclear whether minist would issu declar aim curb euro rise monthli meet eurozon minist late monday high growth europ regard u offici way huge u current account deficit weigh dollar could reduc mr snow current dublin start fournat eu visit applaud ireland introduct low tax deregul help boost growth eurozon grow potenti major part global economi potenti neg consequ citizen economi trade partner say mr snow comment may help shore dollar monday care qualifi statement basic polici cours let open competit market set valu explain market driven fundament toward fundament u offici also say economi need grow u main global growth engin economist say fundament key indic u economi look far rosi domest consum demand cool heavi spend presid bush push budget deficit record bn £bn current account deficit meanwhil hit record bn second quarter mani analyst weaker dollar stay end sight say carsten fritsch strategist commerzbank matter time euro reach analyst maintain u secretli happi low dollar help make export cheaper europ thu boost economi

260,919,intel unveils laser breakthrough intel has unveiled research that could mean data is soon being moved around chips at the speed of light.  scientists at intel have overcome a fundamental problem that before now has prevented silicon being used to generate and amplify laser light. the breakthrough should make it easier to interconnect data networks with the chips that process the information. the intel researchers said products exploiting the breakthrough should appear by the end of the decade.   we ve overcome a fundamental limit   said dr mario paniccia  director of intel s photonics technology lab. writing in the journal nature  dr paniccia - and colleagues haisheng rong  richard jones  ansheng liu  oded cohen  dani hak and alexander fang - show how they have made a continuous laser from the same material used to make computer processors. currently  says dr paniccia  telecommunications equipment that amplifies the laser light that travels down fibre optic cables is very expensive because of the exotic materials  such as gallium arsenide  used to make it.  telecommunications firms and chip makers would prefer to use silicon for these light-moving elements because it is cheap and many of the problems of using it in high-volume manufacturing have been solved.  we re trying to take our silicon competency in manufacturing and apply it to new areas   said dr paniccia. while work has been done to make some of the components that can move light around  before now silicon has not successfully been used to generate or amplify the laser light pulses used to send data over long distances. this is despite the fact that silicon is a much better amplifier of light pulses than the form of the material used in fibre optic cables. this improved amplification is due to the crystalline structure of the silicon used to make computer chips. dr paniccia said that the structure of silicon meant that when laser light passed through it  some colliding photons rip electrons off the atoms within the material.  it creates a cloud of electrons sitting in the silicon and that absorbs all the light   he said. but the intel researchers have found a way to suck away these errant electrons and turn silicon into a material that can both generate and amplify laser light. even better  the laser light produced in this way can  with the help of easy-to-make filters  be tuned across a very wide range of frequencies. semi-conductor lasers made before now have only produced light in a narrow frequency ranges. the result could be the close integration of the fibre optic cables that carry data as light with the computer chips that process it. dr paniccia said the work was the one of several steps needed if silicon was to be used to make components that could carry and process light in the form of data pulses.  it s a technical validation that it can work   he said.,intel unveil laser breakthrough intel unveil research could mean data soon move around chip speed light scientist intel overcom fundament problem prevent silicon use gener amplifi laser light breakthrough make easy interconnect data network chip process inform intel research say product exploit breakthrough appear end decad overcom fundament limit say dr mario paniccia director intel photon technolog lab write journal natur dr paniccia colleagu haisheng rong richard jone ansheng liu ode cohen dani hak alexand fang show make continu laser materi use make comput processor current say dr paniccia telecommun equip amplifi laser light travel fibr optic cabl expens exot materi gallium arsenid use make telecommun firm chip maker would prefer use silicon lightmov element cheap mani problem use highvolum manufactur solv tri take silicon compet manufactur appli new area say dr paniccia work do make compon move light around silicon success use gener amplifi laser light pul use send data long distanc despit fact silicon much well amplifi light pul form materi use fibr optic cabl improv amplif due crystallin structur silicon use make comput chip dr paniccia say structur silicon meant laser light pas collid photon rip electron atom within materi creat cloud electron sit silicon absorb light say intel research found way suck away errant electron turn silicon materi gener amplifi laser light even well laser light produc way help easytomak filter tune across wide rang frequenc semiconductor laser make produc light narrow frequenc rang result could close integr fibr optic cabl carri data light comput chip process dr paniccia say work one sever step need silicon use make compon could carri process light form data pul technic valid work say
261,1613,blair rejects tory terror offer tony blair has rejected a conservative compromise offer that could have eased the passage of anti-terror legislation.  the tories wanted a sunset clause inserted in the anti-terrorism bill that would have forced ministers to revisit it in november. mr blair said the bill  which brings in house arrest for terror suspects  had time limiting safeguards already. the tories say they will vote against it unless changes they want are agreed. the lib dems also oppose the plans.  the government has already given way over the role of judges in house arrest cases.  mr blair s refusal to accept the tories  sunset clause proposals means that the government faces concerted opposition from all sides in the lords. peers begin three days of detailed deliberation on the bill on thursday. the bill proposes  control orders   which as well as placing terrorism suspects under house arrest could mean curfews  tagging or bans on telephone and internet use. these would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial  which the law lords have ruled against as a breach of human rights.  the tories want judicial oversight of all control orders  not just house arrest. shadow home secretary david davis told bbc radio four s the world at one his primary concern was potential miscarriages of justice. he said if someone was wrongly given a control order it would act as a  recruiting sergeant  for terrorists. he went on to say:  if we don t get the amendments we regard as essential  including the sunset clause  we will vote against the bill.  in the commons  mr howard said it would be  far better if the whole of the legislation was subject to a sunset clause so parliament could consider it all in a proper way instead of it being ramrodded through . mr blair said the house arrest powers were already going to be subject to a sunset clause because it was annually renewable.  the second  less stringent  type of control orders would be subject to a court appeal within 14 days and there would be a three-monthly report on their use by  an eminent and independent person .  i believe (the new powers) are a proper balance between the civil liberties of the subject and the necessary national security of this country that i will not put at risk   said mr blair. the lib dems plan to oppose the bill in the lords on thursday. lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten said:  there s a lot of talking left. i would be uneasy about supporting a very bad bill even if it was just for eight months.  a spokeswoman for human rights watch said it was a  basic principle  that people should only be punished after a fair trial. she added:  having a judge impose those punishments without a trial does not sanitise them either.,blair reject torus terror offer toni blair reject conserv compromis offer could ea passag antiterror legisl torus want sunset claus insert antiterror bill would forc minist revisit novemb mr blair say bill bring hous arrest terror suspect time limit safeguard alreadi torus say vote unless chang want agre lib dem also oppos plan govern alreadi give way role judg hous arrest case mr blair refus accept torus sunset claus propos mean govern face concert opposit side lord peer begin three day detail deliber bill thursday bill propos control order well place terror suspect hous arrest could mean curfew tag ban telephon internet use would replac current power detain foreign terror suspect without trial law lord rule breach human right torus want judici oversight control order hous arrest shadow home secretari david davi told bbc radio four world one primari concern potenti miscarriag justic say someon wrongli give control order would act recruit sergeant terrorist go say get amend regard essenti includ sunset claus vote bill common mr howard say would far well whole legisl subject sunset claus parliament could consid proper way instead ramrod mr blair say hous arrest power alreadi go subject sunset claus annual renew second less stringent type control order would subject court appeal within day would threemonthli report use emin independ person believ new power proper balanc civil liberti subject necessari nation secur countri put risk say mr blair lib dem plan oppos bill lord thursday lib dem home affair spokesman mark oaten say lot talk left would uneasi support bad bill even eight month spokeswoman human right watch say basic principl peopl punish fair trial ad judg impos punish without trial sanitis either
262,863,leaders meet over turkish eu bid tony blair has met italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and german chancellor gerhard schroeder to talk about turkey entering the eu.  the downing street talks covered a range of other topics ahead of an eu summit in brussels later in the week. mr blair is an enthusiastic proponent of talks to bring turkey within the recently-expanded eu. italy and germany also favour an early start to talks  but there is scepticism in france and elsewhere. some are worried that turkey s large and rapidly growing population and low average income might make integration into the eu difficult.  some are concerned that a change of government could lead to turkey reneging on key human rights reforms it has recently enacted. and many in france would prefer turkey to admit that world war i-era killing of armenians constituted genocide. there are also issues in france and the netherlands over the possible problems of integrating the first major muslim nation into the eu. but mr blair and the labour government have been the staunchest backers of turkish accession  provided it sticks with human rights and economic reform. mr blair s official spokesman said:  the prime minister has regular meetings with both of them and particularly in advance of european councils.  the key issue at this week s council will be that of turkey  but they will also discuss a range of other matters.,leader meet turkish eu bid toni blair met italian prime minist silvio berlusconi german chancellor gerhard schroeder talk turkey enter eu down street talk cover rang topic ahead eu summit brussel later week mr blair enthusiast propon talk bring turkey within recentlyexpand eu itali germani also favour earli start talk sceptic franc elsewher worri turkey larg rapidli grow popul low averag incom might make integr eu difficult concern chang govern could lead turkey reneg key human right reform recent enact mani franc would prefer turkey admit world war iera kill armenian constitut genocid also issu franc netherland possibl problem integr first major muslim nation eu mr blair labour govern staunchest backer turkish access provid stick human right econom reform mr blair offici spokesman say prime minist regular meet particularli advanc european council key issu week council turkey also discus rang matter

264,1226,millions  to lose textile jobs  millions of the world s poorest textile trade workers will lose their jobs under new trade rules to be introduced in the new year  a charity has warned.  the world trade organisation (wto) is to end its multi-fibre agreement (mfa) on midnight of 31 december. christian aid condemned the move  saying it would see almost a million jobs in bangladesh alone being axed. however  supporters of the change claim it will mean increased efficiency and lower costs for western consumers.  it will also see more jobs created in india and china  advocates argue. the wto said that many developing countries support the end of quotas and stressed that funding was available to countries such as bangladesh to help them make the transition to a fully liberalised market.  there will be a period of adjustment required   said wto spokesman keith rockwell.  some countries will do better than others but there is no one who is suggesting that no developing country will do well out of this.  some countries where it may appear that orders will dry up have seen orders surging and there are many companies who will continue with existing trading relationships.   christian aid has called on british firms not to simply  cut and run  but look after their workers  in a new report called rags to riches to rags.  it added that with few employment alternatives available many sacked garment workers could end up in far worse jobs - with some of the mainly female workers forced into the sex trade. the wto itself has warned that as many as 27 million jobs could be lost as a result of liberalisation in the textile industry. some of the world s fastest developing countries which rely on textile exports to build growth - for example in bangladesh textiles account for almost 85% of the country s exports and the industry employs around 1.5 million people. the mfa pact has helped developing countries get a bigger share of the world market.  the losers in this new trade landscape will be some of the most vulnerable workers in countries such as bangladesh  cambodia  sri lanka and nepal   andrew pendleton  christian aid s head of trade policy  said.  they will be hard-pressed to cope when garment industries there lose their protection.  we are deeply concerned that the new year will spell misery for huge numbers of garment workers.  the wto said there was no consenus among its members to retain the quotas and emphasised that funding was available to countries such as bangladesh to help them adjust to the liberalised market.  it added that the impact of the changes for workers most affected by the shake-up had not been considered  adding such seismic changes to policy should  put the interests of poor people first - rather than simply aiming to liberalise markets at any cost . while the current mfa was not perfect  its did allow third world countries like bangladesh to get onto the first rung of industrial development  christian aid said.  international trade must not be governed by a  race to the bottom  that pitches one set of poor people against another   mr pendleton added.,million lose textil job million world poorest textil trade worker lose job new trade rule introduc new year chariti warn world trade organis wto end multifibr agreement mfa midnight decemb christian aid condemn move say would see almost million job bangladesh alon axe howev support chang claim mean increas effici low cost western consum also see job creat india china advoc argu wto say mani develop countri support end quota stress fund avail countri bangladesh help make transit fulli liberalis market period adjust requir say wto spokesman keith rockwel countri well other one suggest develop countri well countri may appear order dri see order surg mani compani continu exist trade relationship christian aid call british firm simpli cut run look worker new report call rag rich rag ad employ altern avail mani sack garment worker could end far wors job mainli femal worker forc sex trade wto warn mani million job could lose result liberalis textil industri world fast develop countri reli textil export build growth exampl bangladesh textil account almost countri export industri employ around million peopl mfa pact help develop countri get big share world market loser new trade landscap vulner worker countri bangladesh cambodia sri lanka nepal andrew pendleton christian aid head trade polici say hardpress cope garment industri lose protect deepli concern new year spell miseri huge number garment worker wto say consenu among member retain quota emphasis fund avail countri bangladesh help adjust liberalis market ad impact chang worker affect shakeup consid ad seismic chang polici put interest poor peopl first rather simpli aim liberalis market cost current mfa perfect allow third world countri like bangladesh get onto first rung industri develop christian aid say intern trade must govern race bottom pitch one set poor peopl anoth mr pendleton ad
265,631,putting a face to  big brother  literally putting a face on technology could be one of the keys to improving our interaction with hi-tech gadgets.  imagine a surveillance system that also presents a virtual embodiment of a person on a screen who can react to your behaviour  and perhaps even alert you to new e-mails. basic versions of these so-called avatars already exist. together with speech and voice recognition systems  they could replace the keyboard and mouse in the near future. some of these ideas have been showcased at the london s science museum  as part of its future face exhibition.  one such avatar is jeremiah. it is a virtual man  which you can download for free and install in your computer.  his creator  richard bowden  lecturer at the centre for vision  speech and signal processing at the university of surrey  refers to jeremiah as  him   rather than it.  jeremiah is a virtual face that attempts to emulate humans in the way it responds to activity. he is very childlike  he likes visual stimulus   he told the bbc news website.  when he sees children running and laughing and waving at him  he smiles at them. if you ignore him  he gets angry. if you leave  he gets sad. and you can also even surprise him.  jeremiah is not actually intelligent. it works on vision  reacting in a preset way to the information provided by a surveillance tracker system. it is not able to talk or to hear you  at least not yet. the surrey team is already working on jeremiah s next version  that will replace the human face with an underwater and more interactive creature: finn the fish.  i am interested in the interaction  providing the ability of a system to watch what s going on and make decisions based on that   explained dr bowden.  the research comes at a time when people are having to cope with an increasing number of hi-tech gadgets.  experts say a much more natural way to interact with these devices  such as a virtual human  could make it much easier to make the most of all those new gizmos.  if you get up at three o clock in the morning  and you go downstairs  there are probably two things you are going to do: either going to the bathroom  or maybe you are going to make a cup of tea   said dr bowden.  now if the system can watch your behaviour over time  it can learn this  so it would predict what you are going to do  turn on the lights for you  or  before you even get to the kettle  it could have switched it on.  you might even be able to tell your home surveillance system that you will be going away on holiday  and ask if it could make sure that the house is secure once you have left. this might sound like a scary vision of an orwellian future. but it might all depend on the face that is watching you.  when we put the surveillance cameras in our centre  a lot of people were very unhappy about the fact that there was a system watching them   said dr bowden.  but when jeremiah s camera went in  nobody minded  because although it s still watching them  they could see what it was watching.,put face big brother liter put face technolog could one key improv interact hitech gadget imagin surveil system also present virtual embodi person screen react behaviour perhap even alert new email basic version socal avatar alreadi exist togeth speech voic recognit system could replac keyboard mous near futur idea showcas london scienc museum part futur face exhibit one avatar jeremiah virtual man download free instal comput creator richard bowden lectur centr vision speech signal process univers surrey refer jeremiah rather jeremiah virtual face attempt emul human way respond activ childlik like visual stimulu told bbc news websit see child run laugh wave smile ignor get angri leav get sad also even surpris jeremiah actual intellig work vision react preset way inform provid surveil tracker system abl talk hear least yet surrey team alreadi work jeremiah next version replac human face underwat interact creatur finn fish interest interact provid abil system watch go make decis base explain dr bowden research come time peopl cope increas number hitech gadget expert say much natur way interact devic virtual human could make much easy make new gizmo get three clock morn go downstair probabl two thing go either go bathroom mayb go make cup tea say dr bowden system watch behaviour time learn would predict go turn light even get kettl could switch might even abl tell home surveil system go away holiday ask could make sure hous secur left might sound like scari vision orwellian futur might depend face watch put surveil camera centr lot peopl unhappi fact system watch say dr bowden jeremiah camera go nobodi mind although still watch could see watch
266,120,chelsea sack mutu chelsea have sacked adrian mutu after he failed a drugs test.  the 25-year-old tested positive for a banned substance - which he later denied was cocaine - in october. chelsea have decided to write off a possible transfer fee for mutu  a £15.8m signing from parma last season  who may face a two-year suspension. a statement from chelsea explaining the decision read: we want to make clear that chelsea has a zero tolerance policy towards drugs.  mutu scored six goals in his first five games after arriving at stamford bridge but his form went into decline and he was frozen out by coach jose mourinho. chelsea s statement added:  this applies to both performance-enhancing drugs or so-called  recreational  drugs. they have no place at our club or in sport.  in coming to a decision on this case  chelsea believed the club s social responsibility to its fans  players  employees and other stakeholders in football regarding drugs was more important than the major financial considerations to the company.  any player who takes drugs breaches his contract with the club as well as football association rules.  the club totally supports the fa in strong action on all drugs cases.  fifa s disciplinary code stipulates that a first doping offence should be followed by a six-month ban. and the sport s world governing body has re-iterated their stance over mutu s failed drugs test  maintaining it is a matter for the domestic sporting authorities.  fifa is not in a position to make any comment on the matter until the english fa have informed us of their disciplinary decision and the relevant information associated with it   said a fifa spokesman. chelsea s move won backing from drug-testing expert michelle verroken. verroken  a former director of drug-free sport for uk sport  insists the blues were right to sack mutu and have enhanced their reputation by doing so.  chelsea are saying quite clearly to the rest of their players and their fans that this is a situation they are not prepared to tolerate.  it was a very difficult decision for them and an expensive decision for them but the terms of his contract were breached and it was the only decision they could make.  it is a very clear stance by chelsea and it has given a strong boost to the reputation of the club.  it emerged that mutu had failed a drugs test on october 18 and  although it was initially reported that the banned substance in question was cocaine. the romanian international later suggested it was a substance designed to enhance sexual performance. the football association has yet to act on mutu s failed drugs test and refuses to discuss his case.,chelsea sack mutu chelsea sack adrian mutu fail drug test yearold test posit ban substanc later deni cocain octob chelsea decid write possibl transfer fee mutu £m sign parma last season may face twoyear suspens statement chelsea explain decis read want make clear chelsea zero toler polici toward drug mutu score six goal first five game arriv stamford bridg form go declin frozen coach jose mourinho chelsea statement ad appli performanceenhanc drug socal recreat drug place club sport come decis case chelsea believ club social respons fan player employe stakehold footbal regard drug import major financi consider compani player take drug breach contract club well footbal associ rule club total support fa strong action drug case fifa disciplinari code stipul first dope offenc follow sixmonth ban sport world govern bodi reiter stanc mutu fail drug test maintain matter domest sport author fifa posit make comment matter english fa inform u disciplinari decis relev inform associ say fifa spokesman chelsea move back drugtest expert michel verroken verroken former director drugfre sport uk sport insist blue right sack mutu enhanc reput chelsea say quit clearli rest player fan situat prepar toler difficult decis expens decis term contract breach decis could make clear stanc chelsea give strong boost reput club emerg mutu fail drug test octob although initi report ban substanc question cocain romanian intern later suggest substanc design enhanc sexual perform footbal associ yet act mutu fail drug test refus discus case
267,622,ministers  naive  over phone-taps the government is being naive by refusing to allow phone-tap evidence in court  a senior eu politician says.  javier solana  eu foreign policy chief  says phone-tap evidence works in the courts of other european countries. human rights groups  top police officers and many mps say allowing the evidence would remove the need to detain terror suspects without charge. but home secretary charles clarke says the evidence would not make much difference to these cases. mr solana told itv1 s jonathan dimbleby programme:  [phone-tap evidence in court] works  it is normal that it is done  it would be naive not to do it.  it would be naive not to use this technological thing that we have at our disposal.  mr solana s comments come the day after sir ian blair  the newly-appointed metropolitan police commissioner  said he was in favour of phone-tap evidence.  under the anti-terrorism crimes and security act 2001  foreign terror suspects can be detained in british jails without trial or charge. several suspects have been detained under these powers because evidence against them was deemed too sensitive to be heard in court.  some of this evidence is believed to be telephone intercepts. human rights group liberty has argued that if intercept evidence could be heard  these detainees could be brought to trial. but critics of phone-tap trials say the evidence is often weak and can expose the methods of the security services. the home secretary says intercepts would not make much difference because cases against terror suspects frequently rely on other kinds of surveillance. but mr clarke has been forced to change the regime of detention without trial after law lords ruled it illegal. he has opted for a system of  control orders  whereby suspects  both british and foreign  can be held under house arrest or surveillance. these orders will again involve a uk opt-out of parts of the european convention on human rights. while accepting that people  have to be prepared  for a possible terrorist attack  mr solana said he had  qualms  about the home secretary s new plans.  we have to fight terrorism with all our means  but not so far as to change our way of life   he said.,minist naiv phonetap govern naiv refus allow phonetap evid court senior eu politician say javier solana eu foreign polici chief say phonetap evid work court european countri human right group top polic offic mani mp say allow evid would remov need detain terror suspect without charg home secretari charl clark say evid would make much differ case mr solana told itv jonathan dimblebi programm phonetap evid court work normal do would naiv would naiv use technolog thing dispos mr solana comment come day sir ian blair newlyappoint metropolitan polic commission say favour phonetap evid antiterror crime secur act foreign terror suspect detain british jail without trial charg sever suspect detain power evid deem sensit heard court evid believ telephon intercept human right group liberti argu intercept evid could heard detaine could brought trial critic phonetap trial say evid often weak expo method secur servic home secretari say intercept would make much differ case terror suspect frequent reli kind surveil mr clark forc chang regim detent without trial law lord rule illeg opt system control order wherebi suspect british foreign held hous arrest surveil order involv uk optout part european convent human right accept peopl prepar possibl terrorist attack mr solana say qualm home secretari new plan fight terror mean far chang way life say
268,2128,dunne keen to commit to man city richard dunne is ready to commit his long-term future to manchester city after turning his career around.  he was once threatened with the sack by city boss kevin keegan but has since responded with impressive performances  prompting interest from other clubs. early talks have taken place and the defender said:  hopefully something will be sorted out as soon as possible.  i definitely want to stay at city because i have really improved as a player here.  newcastle boss graeme souness is said to have been impressed enough by dunne s turnaround in form to be ready to make a bid for the big stopper in the january transfer window. but the 25-year-old dubliner underlined his intention to stay at eastlands. he added:  it s nice to be linked with top clubs but the important thing is this one and what we do.  i really enjoy it at city and i want to keep that going.  keegan is expected to be told there will be no funds to bring in fresh faces in january. dunne s professionalism was famously questioned by keegan  who ordered the defender home after he allegedly turned up for training in a dishevelled state.  but dunne is keen to put that period of his life behind him and said:  i ve grown up a lot and the manager sees me as one of the most experienced players in the squad.  i ve played more games than any other outfield players this season so i can t be regarded as being a kid any more.  i have to use that as added pressure to perform and apart from the games at newcastle and middlesbrough  defensively we ve done quite well.  keegan is set for another boost when goalkeeper nicky weaver makes his long-awaited return in a reserve game at blackburn on tuesday. former england under-21 keeper weaver has missed nearly three full seasons with a succession of knee injuries  which eventually needed pioneering transplant surgery earlier this year.,dunn keen commit man citi richard dunn readi commit longterm futur manchest citi turn career around threaten sack citi bos kevin keegan sinc respond impress perform prompt interest club earli talk take place defend say hope someth sort soon possibl definit want stay citi realli improv player newcastl bos graem souness say impress enough dunn turnaround form readi make bid big stopper januari transfer window yearold dublin underlin intent stay eastland ad nice link top club import thing one realli enjoy citi want keep go keegan expect told fund bring fresh face januari dunn profession famous question keegan order defend home allegedli turn train dishevel state dunn keen put period life behind say grown lot manag see one experienc player squad play game outfield player season regard kid use ad pressur perform apart game newcastl middlesbrough defens do quit well keegan set anoth boost goalkeep nicki weaver make longawait return reserv game blackburn tuesday former england under keeper weaver miss nearli three full season success knee injuri eventu need pioneer transplant surgeri earlier year

270,429,china suspends 26 power projects china has ordered a halt to construction work on 26 big power stations  including two at the three gorges dam  on environmental grounds.  the move is a surprising one because china is struggling to increase energy supplies for its booming economy. last year 24 provinces suffered black outs. the state environmental protection agency said the 26 projects had failed to do proper environmental assessments. topping the list was a controversial dam on the scenic upper yangtze river.  construction of these projects has started without approval of the assessment of their environmental impact... they are typical illegal projects of construction first  approval next   said sepa vice-director pan yue  in a statement on the agency s website.  some of the projects may be allowed to start work again with the proper permits  but others would be cancelled  he said. altogether  the agency ordered 30 projects halted. other projects included a petrochemicals plant and a port in fujian. the bulk of the list was made up of new power plants  with some extensions to existing ones. the stoppages would appear to be another step in the central government s battle to control projects licensed by local officials. however  previous crackdowns have tended to focus on projects for which the government argued there was overcapacity  such as steel and cement. the government has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages which forced many factories onto part-time working last year. in 2004  china increased its generating capacity by 12.6%  or 440 700 megawatts (mw). the biggest single project to be halted was the xiluodi dam project  designed to produce 12 600 mw of electricity. it is being built on the jinshajiang - or  river of golden sand  as the upper reaches of the yangtze are known. second and third on the agency s list were two power stations being built at the $22bn three gorges dam project on the central yangtze - an underground 4 200 mw power plant and a 100 mw plant.  the three gorges dam has proved controversial in china - where more than half a million people have been relocated to make way for it - and abroad. it has drawn criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists. the damming of the upper yangtze has also begun to attract criticism from environmentalists in china. in april 2004  central government officials ordered a halt to work on the nearby nu river  which is part of a united nations world heritage site  the three parallel rivers site which covers the yangtze  mekong and nu (also known as the salween)  according to the uk-published china review. that move reportedly followed a protest from the thai government about the downstream impact of the dams  and a critical documentary made by chinese journalists. china s energy shortage influenced global prices for oil  coal and shipping last year.,china suspend power project china order halt construct work big power station includ two three gorg dam environment ground move surpris one china struggl increas energi suppli boom economi last year provinc suffer black out state environment protect agenc say project fail proper environment ass top list controversi dam scenic upper yangtz river construct project start without approv ass environment impact typic illeg project construct first approv next say sepa vicedirector pan yue statement agenc websit project may allow start work proper permit other would cancel say altogeth agenc order project halt project includ petrochem plant port fujian bulk list make new power plant extens exist one stoppag would appear anoth step central govern battl control project licens local offici howev previou crackdown tend focu project govern argu overcapac steel cement govern encourag construct new electr gener capac solv chronic energi shortag forc mani factori onto parttim work last year china increas gener capac megawatt mw big singl project halt xiluodi dam project design produc mw electr built jinshajiang river golden sand upper reach yangtz know second third agenc list two power station built bn three gorg dam project central yangtz underground mw power plant mw plant three gorg dam prove controversi china half million peopl reloc make way abroad drawn critic environment group oversea human right activist dam upper yangtz also begin attract critic environmentalist china april central govern offici order halt work nearbi nu river part unit nation world heritag site three parallel river site cover yangtz mekong nu also know salween accord ukpublish china review move reportedli follow protest thai govern downstream impact dam critic documentari make chine journalist china energi shortag influenc global price oil coal ship last year
271,1222,venezuela and china sign oil deal venezuelan president hugo chavez has offered china wide-ranging access to the country s oil reserves.  the offer  made as part of a trade deal between the two countries  will allow china to operate oil fields in venezuela and invest in new refineries. venezuela has also offered to supply 120 000 barrels of fuel oil a month to china. venezuela - the world s fifth largest oil exporter - sells about 60% of its output to the united states. mr chavez s administration  which has a strained relationship with the us  is trying to diversify sales to reduce its dependence on its largest export market.  china s quick-growing economy s need for oil has contributed to record-high oil prices this year  along with political unrest in the middle east and supply bottlenecks. oil prices are finishing the year roughly 30% higher than they were in january 2004.  in 2004  according to forecasts from the ministry of commerce  china s oil imports will be 110m tons  up 21% on the previous year. china has been a net importer of oil since the mid 1990 s with more than a third of the oil and gas it consumes coming from abroad. a lack of sufficient domestic production and the need to lessen its dependence on imports from the middle east has meant that china is looking to invest in other potential markets such as latin america. mr chavez  who is visiting china  said his country would put its many of its oil facilities at the disposal of china. chinese firms would be allowed to operate 15 mature oil fields in the east of venezuela  which could produce more than one billion barrels  he confirmed. the two countries will also continue a joint venture agreement to produce stocks of the boiler fuel orimulsion. mr chavez has also invited chinese firms to bid for gas exploration contracts which his government will offer next year in the western gulf of venezuela. the two countries also signed a number of other agreements covering other industries including mining.,venezuela china sign oil deal venezuelan presid hugo chavez offer china widerang access countri oil reserv offer make part trade deal two countri allow china oper oil field venezuela invest new refineri venezuela also offer suppli barrel fuel oil month china venezuela world fifth large oil export sell output unit state mr chavez administr strain relationship u tri diversifi sale reduc depend large export market china quickgrow economi need oil contribut recordhigh oil price year along polit unrest middl east suppli bottleneck oil price finish year roughli high januari accord forecast ministri commerc china oil import m ton previou year china net import oil sinc mid third oil ga consum come abroad lack suffici domest product need lessen depend import middl east meant china look invest potenti market latin america mr chavez visit china say countri would put mani oil facil dispos china chine firm would allow oper matur oil field east venezuela could produc one billion barrel confirm two countri also continu joint ventur agreement produc stock boiler fuel orimuls mr chavez also invit chine firm bid ga explor contract govern offer next year western gulf venezuela two countri also sign number agreement cover industri includ mine
272,1101,bbc poll indicates economic gloom citizens in a majority of nations surveyed in a bbc world service poll believe the world economy is worsening.  most respondents also said their national economy was getting worse. but when asked about their own family s financial outlook  a majority in 14 countries said they were positive about the future. almost 23 000 people in 22 countries were questioned for the poll  which was mostly conducted before the asian tsunami disaster. the poll found that a majority or plurality of people in 13 countries believed the economy was going downhill  compared with respondents in nine countries who believed it was improving. those surveyed in three countries were split. in percentage terms  an average of 44% of respondents in each country said the world economy was getting worse  compared to 34% who said it was improving. similarly  48% were pessimistic about their national economy  while 41% were optimistic. and 47% saw their family s economic conditions improving  as against 36% who said they were getting worse.  the poll of 22 953 people was conducted by the international polling firm globescan  together with the program on international policy attitudes (pipa) at the university of maryland.  while the world economy has picked up from difficult times just a few years ago  people seem to not have fully absorbed this development  though they are personally experiencing its effects   said pipa director steven kull.  people around the world are saying:  i m ok  but the world isn t .  there may be a perception that war  terrorism and religious and political divisions are making the world a worse place  even though that has not so far been reflected in global economic performance  says the bbc s elizabeth blunt.  the countries where people were most optimistic  both for the world and for their own families  were two fast-growing developing economies  china and india  followed by indonesia. china has seen two decades of blistering economic growth  which has led to wealth creation on a huge scale  says the bbc s louisa lim in beijing. but the results also may reflect the untrammelled confidence of people who are subject to endless government propaganda about their country s rosy economic future  our correspondent says. south korea was the most pessimistic  while respondents in italy and mexico were also quite gloomy. the bbc s david willey in rome says one reason for that result is the changeover from the lira to the euro in 2001  which is widely viewed as the biggest reason why their wages and salaries are worth less than they used to be. the philippines was among the most upbeat countries on prospects for respondents  families  but one of the most pessimistic about the world economy. pipa conducted the poll from 15 november 2004 to 3 january 2005 across 22 countries in face-to-face or telephone interviews. the interviews took place between 15 november 2004 and 5 january 2005. the margin of error is between 2.5 and 4 points  depending on the country. in eight of the countries  the sample was limited to major metropolitan areas.,bbc poll indic econom gloom citizen major nation survey bbc world servic poll believ world economi worsen respond also say nation economi get wors ask famili financi outlook major countri say posit futur almost peopl countri question poll mostli conduct asian tsunami disast poll found major plural peopl countri believ economi go downhil compar respond nine countri believ improv survey three countri split percentag term averag respond countri say world economi get wors compar say improv similarli pessimist nation economi optimist saw famili econom condit improv say get wors poll peopl conduct intern poll firm globescan togeth program intern polici attitud pipa univers maryland world economi pick difficult time year ago peopl seem fulli absorb develop though person experienc effect say pipa director steven kull peopl around world say ok world may percept war terror religi polit divis make world wors place even though far reflect global econom perform say bbc elizabeth blunt countri peopl optimist world famili two fastgrow develop economi china india follow indonesia china see two decad blister econom growth lead wealth creation huge scale say bbc louisa lim beij result also may reflect untrammel confid peopl subject endless govern propaganda countri rosi econom futur correspond say south korea pessimist respond itali mexico also quit gloomi bbc david willey rome say one reason result changeov lira euro wide view big reason wage salari worth less use philippin among upbeat countri prospect respond famili one pessimist world economi pipa conduct poll novemb januari across countri facetofac telephon interview interview take place novemb januari margin error point depend countri eight countri sampl limit major metropolitan area

277,454,preview: ireland v england (sun) lansdowne road  dublin  sunday  27 february  1500 gmt  bbc1  radio 4 lw and this website  ireland are going for their first grand slam since 1948 after two opening wins  and england represent their sternest test of the championship so far. england were sloppy and leaderless in the defeats against wales and france and another loss would be unthinkable. the pressure is on coach andy robinson and his side have to deliver.  despite england s dramatic dip in form since the world cup final - they have lost eight of their last 13 matches - ireland coach eddie o sullivan says his side should not underestimate the visitors.  had they kicked their points they would have beaten france and that would have created a different landscape for sunday   he said.  this is england we are talking about. they have a depth of talent and a very good record against ireland.  they will target a victory in dublin as the turning point in their six nations.  the differences between the sides is also highlighted in the team selections for the dublin encounter.  ireland  despite having gordon d arcy still out injured  have been boosted by the return of star skipper brian o driscoll who missed the scotland game with a hamstring injury.  the knowledge that the england game was coming up really helped during rehabilitation   he said.  the will to play in this game was enormous. it doesn t get much bigger than england at home.  as well as entering the tournament without players like jonny wilkinson  mike tindall and richard hill  england have now lost two tighthead props in julian white and phil vickery while blind-side flanker lewis moody is a major concern. robinson  who received a lot of flak for the inclusion and then dropping of centre mathew tait  has kept faith with kicking fly-half charlie hodgson despite his horror show at twickenham. if england slump in dublin  it will be their worst run of results in the championship since 1987.  but robinson was bullish during the week about the game  saying that his side  are going there to get in their faces   and has identified the line-out and tackle area as the key to england s chances. and despite the recent results  skipper jason robinson believes there is nothing wrong with the mood in the camp.  there is no lack of confidence in the team   said the sale full-back.  we have had a good week s training and we are all looking forward to the challenge.  i still believe in this team. i know if we get our game right we will win the games.   g murphy; g dempsey  b o driscoll  s horgan  d hickie; r o gara  p stringer; r corrigan  s byrne  j hayes; m o kelly  p o connell; s easterby  j o connor  a foley.  f sheahan  m horan  d o callaghan  e miller  g easterby  d humphreys  k maggs.  j robinson (capt); m cueto  j noon  o barkley  j lewsey; c hodgson  h ellis; g rowntree  s thompson  m stevens; d grewcock  b kay; j worsley  l moody  m corry.  a titterrell  d bell  s borthwick  a hazell  m dawson  a goode  o smith.,preview ireland v england sun lansdown road dublin sunday februari gmt bbc radio lw websit ireland go first grand slam sinc two open win england repres sternest test championship far england sloppi leaderless defeat wale franc anoth loss would unthink pressur coach andi robinson side deliv despit england dramat dip form sinc world cup final lose eight last match ireland coach eddi sullivan say side underestim visitor kick point would beaten franc would creat differ landscap sunday say england talk depth talent good record ireland target victori dublin turn point six nation differ side also highlight team select dublin encount ireland despit gordon arci still injur boost return star skipper brian driscol miss scotland game hamstr injuri knowledg england game come realli help rehabilit say play game enorm get much big england home well enter tournament without player like jonni wilkinson mike tindal richard hill england lose two tighthead prop julian white phil vickeri blindsid flanker lewi moodi major concern robinson receiv lot flak inclus drop centr mathew tait kept faith kick flyhalf charli hodgson despit horror show twickenham england slump dublin bad run result championship sinc robinson bullish week game say side go get face identifi lineout tackl area key england chanc despit recent result skipper jason robinson believ noth wrong mood camp lack confid team say sale fullback good week train look forward challeng still believ team know get game right win game g murphi g dempsey b driscol horgan hicki r gara p stringer r corrigan byrn j hay kelli p connel easterbi j connor foley f sheahan horan callaghan e miller g easterbi humphrey k magg j robinson capt cueto j noon barkley j lewsey c hodgson h elli g rowntre thompson steven grewcock b kay j worsley l moodi corri titterrel bell borthwick hazel dawson good smith

279,1868,federer breezes into semi-finals roger federer reached the last four of the qatar open with an easy 6-1 6-2 win over seventh seed feliciano lopez.  the swiss world number one reeled off a series winners to outclass the spaniard and set up a semi-final match against russian nikolay davydenko. federer  who lost in the quarter-final in his last qatar appearance in 2003  was happy with his form.  i think i played better than against greg rusedski and i am happy i am playing so well   said the top seed. lopez showed glimpses of resolve early in the second set when he held his first service game and came close to breaking federer. but the swiss saved a break point and promptly broke serve in the following game to seize control. davydenko  meanwhile  upset french third seed sebastien grosjean 2-6 6-3 6-2. fabrice santoro completed a miserable day for france when he was forced to retire when 6-2 3-0 down to albert costa. spaniard costa will next face croatian ivan ljubicic after the sixth seed beat rafael nadal 6-2 6-7 (3/7) 6-3.,feder breez semifin roger feder reach last four qatar open easi win seventh seed feliciano lopez swiss world number one reel seri winner outclass spaniard set semifin match russian nikolay davydenko feder lose quarterfin last qatar appear happi form think play well greg rusedski happi play well say top seed lopez show glimps resolv earli second set held first servic game come close break feder swiss save break point promptli broke serv follow game seiz control davydenko meanwhil upset french third seed sebastien grosjean fabric santoro complet miser day franc forc retir albert costa spaniard costa next face croatian ivan ljubic sixth seed beat rafael nadal
280,1026,henman to face saulnier test british number one tim henman will face france s cyril saulnier in the first round of next week s australian open.  greg rusedski  the british number two  is in the same quarter of the draw and could face andy roddick in the second round if he beats swede jonas bjorkman. local favourite lleyton hewitt will meet france s arnaud clement  while defending champion and world number one roger federer faces fabrice santoro. women s top seed lindsay davenport drew spanish veteran conchita martinez.  henman came from two sets down to defeat saulnier in the first round of the french open last year  so he knows he faces a tough test in melbourne. the seventh seed  who has never gone beyond the quarter-finals in the year s first major and is lined up to meet roddick in the last eight  is looking forward to the match.  he s tough player on any surface  he s got a lot of ability   he said.  we had a really tight one in paris that went my way so i m going to need to play well from the outset because he s a dangerous competitor.  switzerland s federer  seeded one  is the hot favourite having won three of the four grand slam titles in 2004. he has beaten santoro in five of their seven previous encounters  but is taking nothing for granted.  it s a tricky match   federer said.  i played him at the us open and won quite comfortably then. but you never know  if the rhythm is a bit off  he can keep you guessing and make it difficult.  the most important thing  though  is to get used to playing five-set matches and winning them.  the 23-year-old could meet four-time champion andre agassi in the quarter-finals before meeting russian marat safin  the player he beat in last year s final.  eighth-seeded american agassi is set to play a qualifier in round one if he can shake off a hip injury which ruled him out of the kooyong classic. second seed andy roddick will open his campaign against irakli labadze of georgia. the american could meet rusedski in the second round  seventh seed henman in the quarter-finals and hewitt in the last four. hewitt is hoping to become the first australian man to win the event since mark edmondson in 1976. the 23-year-old has never been beyond round four in eight attempts at melbourne park but has at least secured the opposite half of the draw to federer  who beat him in the australian open  wimbledon and us open last year. safin  seeded four  opens his campaign against a qualifier with 16th seed tommy haas  the player he beat in the semi-finals in 2002  a possible fourth-round opponent.  in the women s draw  davenport could encounter eighth-seeded venus williams in the quarter-finals and third-ranked anastasia myskina  the french open champion  in the semi-finals. bronchitis ruled davenport  the 2000 australian open champion  out of her sydney quarter-final on thursday. venus williams  who lost to younger sister serena in the melbourne final two years ago  opens against eleni daniilidou of greece. serena williams  who won her fourth consecutive grand slam at the 2003 australian open  was drawn in the bottom quarter with second seed amelie mauresmo  a runner-up in 1999. serena will

288,792,uk heading wrong way  says howard tony blair has had the chance to tackle the problems facing britain and has failed  michael howard has said.   britain is heading in the wrong direction   the conservative leader said in his new year message. mr blair s government was a  bossy  interfering government that takes decisions that should be made by individuals   he added. but labour s campaign spokesman fraser kemp responded:  britain is working  don t let the tories wreck it again . mr howard also paid tribute to the nation s character for its generous response to the asian quake disaster. the catastrophe was overshadowing the hopes for the future at this usually positive time of the year  mr howard said.   we watched the scenes of destruction with a sense of disbelief. the scale  the speed  the ferocity of what happened on boxing day is difficult to grasp.  yet britain s response has shone a light on our nation s character. the last week has shown that the warm  caring heart of britain beats as strong as ever.  he went on to reflect on the values that  most britons hold dear . looking ahead to the coming general election  he pledged to  turn these beliefs into reality  and set out the choices he says are facing britain.  how much tax do people want to pay  who will give taxpayers value for money  the clean hospitals and good  disciplined schools they want   who can be trusted to get a grip on the disorder on our streets and the chaos in our immigration system    mr blair has failed to tackle these problems  he claimed  saying he has the  wrong solution  to them.   the result is big government and higher taxes eroding incentives  undermining enterprise and denying people choice.  worst of all  it is a government that has wasted people s money and failed to tackle the problems families face today.  the tories  he said  can cut crime and improve public services without asking people to pay more taxes.  we can have progress without losing what makes britain great - its tolerance  the respect for the rule of law  the ability of everyone to fulfil their potential.  we simply need to change direction. the election will give britain the chance to change.  this is the record mr blair will have to defend in the coming months  he said  urging voters to hold him to account.  but labour spokesman mr kemp said:  it would be more appropriate for this message to come out on 1 april  not 1 january.   let us never forget that when michael howard was in government britain suffered mass unemployment  15% interest rates  record home repossessions  and the introduction of the poll tax.  with labour britain is working. rather than alluding to false promises michael howard should be starting 2005 with an apology to the british people for the misery that the government  of which he was a member  inflicted upon the country.,uk head wrong way say howard toni blair chanc tackl problem face britain fail michael howard say britain head wrong direct conserv leader say new year messag mr blair govern bossi interf govern take decis make individu ad labour campaign spokesman fraser kemp respond britain work let torus wreck mr howard also paid tribut nation charact gener respons asian quak disast catastroph overshadow hope futur usual posit time year mr howard say watch scene destruct sen disbelief scale speed feroc happen box day difficult grasp yet britain respons shone light nation charact last week show warm care heart britain beat strong ever go reflect valu briton hold dear look ahead come gener elect pledg turn belief realiti set choic say face britain much tax peopl want pay give taxpay valu money clean hospit good disciplin school want trust get grip disord street chao immigr system mr blair fail tackl problem claim say wrong solut result big govern high tax erod incent undermin enterpris deni peopl choic bad govern wast peopl money fail tackl problem famili face today torus say cut crime improv public servic without ask peopl pay tax progress without lose make britain great toler respect rule law abil everyon fulfil potenti simpli need chang direct elect give britain chanc chang record mr blair defend come month say urg voter hold account labour spokesman mr kemp say would appropri messag come april januari let u never forget michael howard govern britain suffer mass unemploy interest rate record home repossess introduct poll tax labour britain work rather allud fals promis michael howard start apolog british peopl miseri govern member inflict upon countri

290,1561,china had role in yukos split-up china lent russia $6bn (£3.2bn) to help the russian government renationalise the key yuganskneftegas unit of oil group yukos  it has been revealed.  the kremlin said on tuesday that the $6bn which russian state bank veb lent state-owned rosneft to help buy yugansk in turn came from chinese banks. the revelation came as the russian government said rosneft had signed a long-term oil supply deal with china. the deal sees rosneft receive $6bn in credits from china s cnpc.  according to russian newspaper vedomosti  these credits would be used to pay off the loans rosneft received to finance the purchase of yugansk. reports said cnpc had been offered 20% of yugansk in return for providing finance but the company opted for a long-term oil supply deal instead. analysts said one factor that might have influenced the chinese decision was the possibility of litigation from yukos  yugansk s former owner  if cnpc had become a shareholder. rosneft and veb declined to comment.  the two companies [rosneft and cnpc] have agreed on the pre-payment for long-term deliveries   said russian oil official sergei oganesyan.  there is nothing unusual that the pre-payment is for five to six years.   the announcements help to explain how rosneft  a medium-sized  indebted  and relatively unknown firm  was able to finance its surprise purchase of yugansk. yugansk was sold for $9.3bn in an auction last year to help yukos pay off part of a $27bn bill in unpaid taxes and fines.  the embattled russian oil giant had previously filed for bankruptcy protection in a us court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm. but yugansk was sold to a little known shell company which in turn was bought by rosneft. yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder mikhail khodorkovsky. once the country s richest man  mr khodorkovsky is on trial for fraud and tax evasion.  the deal between rosneft and cnpc is seen as part of china s desire to secure long-term oil supplies to feed its booming economy. china s thirst for products such as crude oil  copper and steel has helped pushed global commodity prices to record levels.  clearly the chinese are trying to get some leverage [in russia]   said dmitry lukashov  an analyst at brokerage aton.  they understand property rights in russia are not the most important rights  and they are more interested in guaranteeing supplies.   if the price of oil is fixed under the deal  which is unlikely  it could be very profitable for the chinese   mr lukashov continued.  and rosneft is in desperate need of cash  so it s a good deal for them too.,china role yuko splitup china lent russia bn £bn help russian govern renationalis key yuganskneftega unit oil group yuko reveal kremlin say tuesday bn russian state bank veb lent stateown rosneft help buy yugansk turn come chine bank revel come russian govern say rosneft sign longterm oil suppli deal china deal see rosneft receiv bn credit china cnpc accord russian newspap vedomosti credit would use pay loan rosneft receiv financ purchas yugansk report say cnpc offer yugansk return provid financ compani opt longterm oil suppli deal instead analyst say one factor might influenc chine decis possibl litig yuko yugansk former owner cnpc becom sharehold rosneft veb declin comment two compani rosneft cnpc agre prepay longterm deliveri say russian oil offici sergei oganesyan noth unusu prepay five six year announc help explain rosneft medium indebt rel unknown firm abl financ surpris purchas yugansk yugansk sell bn auction last year help yuko pay part bn bill unpaid tax fine embattl russian oil giant previous file bankruptci protect u court attempt prevent forc sale main product arm yugansk sell littl know shell compani turn bought rosneft yuko claim downfal punish polit ambit founder mikhail khodorkovski countri richest man mr khodorkovski trial fraud tax evas deal rosneft cnpc see part china desir secur longterm oil suppli feed boom economi china thirst product crude oil copper steel help push global commod price record level clearli chine tri get leverag russia say dmitri lukashov analyst brokerag aton understand properti right russia import right interest guarante suppli price oil fix deal unlik could profit chine mr lukashov continu rosneft desper need cash good deal

292,418,firms pump billions into pensions employers have spent billions of pounds propping up their final salary pensions over the past year  research suggests.  a survey of 280 schemes by incomes data services  (ids) said employer contributions had increased from £5.5bn to £8.2bn a year  a rise of 49.7%. companies facing the biggest deficits had raised their pension contributions by 100% or more  ids said. many firms are struggling to keep this type of scheme open  because of rising costs and increased liabilities. a final salary scheme  also known as a defined benefit scheme  promises to pay a pension related to the salary the scheme member is earning when they retire.  the rising cost of maintaining such schemes has led many employers to replace final salary schemes with money purchase  or defined contribution  schemes. these are less risky for employers. under money purchase schemes  employees pay into a pension fund which is used to buy an annuity - a policy which pays out an income until death - on retirement.  ids said there were some schemes in good health.  but  in many cases  firms had been forced to top up funds to tackle  yawning deficits . the level of contributions paid by employers has increased gradually since the late 1990s. in 1998/99  for example  contributions rose by 4.7% and in 2002/03 by 8.6%. in contrast  between 1996 and 1998  some employers cut their contribution levels. helen sudell  editor of the ids pensions service  said the rise in contributions was  staggering  and the highest ever recorded by ids.  we have warned before that the widespread closure of final salary schemes to new entrants is just the beginning of a much bigger movement away from paternalistic provision   said ms sudell.  with figures like this there can be little doubt that many employers will have to reduce future benefits at some point for those staff still in these schemes.,firm pump billion pension employ spent billion pound prop final salari pension past year research suggest survey scheme incom data servic id say employ contribut increas £bn £bn year rise compani face big deficit rais pension contribut id say mani firm struggl keep type scheme open rise cost increas liabil final salari scheme also know defin benefit scheme promis pay pension relat salari scheme member earn retir rise cost maintain scheme lead mani employ replac final salari scheme money purchas defin contribut scheme less riski employ money purchas scheme employe pay pension fund use buy annuiti polici pay incom death retir id say scheme good health mani case firm forc top fund tackl yawn deficit level contribut paid employ increas gradual sinc late s exampl contribut rise contrast employ cut contribut level helen sudel editor id pension servic say rise contribut stagger high ever record id warn widespread closur final salari scheme new entrant begin much big movement away paternalist provis say m sudel figur like littl doubt mani employ reduc futur benefit point staff still scheme

294,618,rivals of the £400 apple... the mac mini is the cheapest apple computer ever. but though it is cheap for a mac how does it compare to pcs that cost about the same amount  dot.life tries to find out if you can you get more for your money if you stick with the beige box.      an extremely small computer that is designed to bring the macintosh to the masses.  apple offer a less powerful mac mini for £339 but the £399 models has a 1.4ghz power pc chip  80 gigabyte hard drive  combined cd burner/dvd player. it comes equipped with usb and firewire ports for peripheral connections  ethernet port for broadband  a port for standard video output and an audio/headphone jack.the machine comes with mac os x  the apple operating system  the software suite ilife  which includes itunes  iphoto  imovie  idvd and garageband.  a monitor  keyboard or mouse. there is also no built-in support for wireless technology or any speakers. the lack of a dvd burner is an omission in the age of backing-up important software. wireless and a dvd burner can be added at extra cost.  apple are targeting people who already have a main computer and want to upgrade - especially pc users who have used an apple ipod.  compact and stylish  the mac mini would not look out of place in any home. apple computers are famously user friendly and offer much better network security  which means fewer viruses. the package of software that comes with the machine is the best money can buy.  the mac mini is just a box. if you don t already have a monitor etc  adding them to the package sees the value for money begin to dwindle. macs don t offer the upgrade flexibility of a pc and the machine s specifications lack the horse power for tasks such as high-end video editing or games.   the mac mini puts the macintosh within the reach of everyone   an apple spokesman said.  it will bring more customers to the platform  especially pc users and owners.     an entry-level machine designed for basic home use.  a 2.6ghz intel celeron chip  40 gigabyte hard drive  256mb  combined cd burner/dvd player. it comes equipped with a 17 inch monitor  keyboard and mouse. the machine has 6 usb ports and an ethernet port for broadband connection. there s also a port for standard video output. the machine comes with windows xp home edition. it provides basic home tools such as a media player and word processor.  a dvd burner  or any wireless components built in. wireless and a dvd burner can be added at extra cost.  homes and small offices  including those looking to add a low cost second computer.  cost is the clear advantage. the dell provides enough power and software for basic gaming and internet surfing. it s easily upgradeable so a bigger hard drive  better sound and graphics cards can be added.  the dell is hardly stylish and the hard drive is on the small size for anyone wanting to store photos or a decent sized digital music collection.   this machine is for small businesses and for people who want a second computer for basic home use  perhaps in a kids bedroom   a spokesman for dell said.  i think we offer better value once you realise all the extras needed for the mac mini.     a desktop computer that pc pro magazine dubbed best performer in a group test of machines that cost only £399 (£469 including vat).  a good basic pc that  according to pc pro  has  superb upgrade potential . for your money you get a 1.8ghz amd sempron processor  512mb of ram  120gb hard drive  dvd writer  16-inch monitor  mouse  keyboard and windows xp2  much more than the basics. it cannot handle 3d graphics and has no firewire slots.  those on a limited budget who want a machine they can add to and improve as their cash allows.  it s cheap and has plenty of room to improve but that could end up making it expensive in the long run. it s a good basic workhorse.  it s not pretty and has a monitor rather than a flat-panel display. some of the upgrades offered by jal to the basic model are pricey. you might find that you want to chop and change quite quickly.  nick ross  deputy labs editor at pc pro  said the important point about buying a cheap and cheerful pc is the upgrade path. interest has switched from processor power to graphics and sound cards as that s what makes the difference in games.  even manufacturers are not going to be marketing machines as faster   he said   they ll emphasise the different features.     a computer built from bits you buy and put together yourself.  a surprisingly good pc sporting an amd athlon xp 2500 processor  512 megabytes ram  a graphics card with 128 ram on board plus tv out  a 40 gb hard drive  cd-writer and dvd player  windows xp home.  anything else. you re building it so you have to buy all the software you want to install and do your own trouble-shooting and tech support. building your own machine is easier than it used to be but you need to read specifications carefully to make sure all parts work together.  experienced and keen pc users. building your own pc  or upgrading the one you have  is a great way to improve your understanding of how it all works.  it s cheap  you can specify exactly what you want and you get the thrill of putting it together yourself. and a bigger thrill if everything works as it should.  once it s built you won t be able to do much with it until you start buying software for it. if it starts to go wrong it might take a lot of fixing. as gavin cox of the excellent buildyourown.org.uk website put it:  it will be tough to obtain/build a pc to ever be as compact and charming as the mac mini.    performance-wise  it s not  cutting edge  and is barely entry-level by today s market  but up against the mac mini  i believe it will hold its own and even pull a few more tricks   says gavin cox. the good news is that the machine is eminently expandable. by contrast  says mr cox  the mac mini is almost disposable.,rival £ appl mac mini cheapest appl comput ever

297,1761,mcclaren hails boro s uefa spirit middlesbrough boss steve mcclaren has praised the way his side have got to grips with european football after the 2-0 uefa cup win against lazio.  boro  who are playing in europe for the first time in their 128-year history  are top of group e with maximum points.  i think we have taken to europe really well   said mcclaren.  we got about lazio  didn t let them settle or play. and in possession  we controlled it and looked threatening every time we went forward.  before the match  mcclaren had said that a win over the italian giants would put boro firmly on the european footballing map. and after they did just that he said:  it was a perfect european night. for the team to give the fans a performance like that was the icing on the cake.  there have been many good performances but this was something special.   you can see that the experience we have in the squad is showing. to win in europe you need to defend well  and we have done that because we have conceded only one goal in four games.  we can also score goals  and again that is something you can see from the performances we have had  so we have good balance. mcclaren s only criticism of his side was that their dominance should have been resulted in more goals.  it should have been more convincing   said mcclaren.  but i had watched lazio in recent weeks and i saw them score a late equaliser against inter milan on saturday so i knew we needed a second goal.   no matter what anybody says  lazio are favourites to win this competition.  middlesbrough forward boudewijn zenden said he did not expect such a comfortable match after he scored both goals.  we didn t expect it to be that one-sided   said zenden.  we did quite well in the first half  we pressured them and they didn t cope with that.  i think we played quite well and it was a very good game  especially in the first half.  the holland international said boro are confident of progressing in the competition after winning their first two group games.  we ve got a very good feeling  there is a good spirit  all the lads work hard for each other and it s a squad of friendly players  which i think you can see on the pitch   he added.,mcclaren hail boro uefa spirit middlesbrough bos steve mcclaren prais way side get grip european footbal uefa cup win lazio boro play europ first time year histori top group e maximum point think take europ realli well say mcclaren get lazio let settl play posse control look threaten everi time go forward match mcclaren say win italian giant would put boro firmli european footbal map say perfect european night team give fan perform like ice cake mani good perform someth special see experi squad show win europ need defend well do conced one goal four game also score goal someth see perform good balanc mcclaren critic side domin result goal convinc say mcclaren watch lazio recent week saw score late equalis inter milan saturday knew need second goal matter anybodi say lazio favourit win competit middlesbrough forward boudewijn zenden say expect comfort match score goal expect onesid say zenden quit well first half pressur cope think play quit well good game especi first half holland intern say boro confid progress competit win first two group game get good feel good spirit lad work hard squad friendli player think see pitch ad

299,1515,apple laptop is  greatest gadget  the apple powerbook 100 has been chosen as the greatest gadget of all time  by us magazine mobile pc.  the 1991 laptop was chosen because it was one of the first  lightweight  portable computers and helped define the layout of all future notebook pcs. the magazine has compiled an all-time top 100 list of gadgets  which includes the sony walkman at number three and the 1956 zenith remote control at two. gadgets needed moving parts and/or electronics to warrant inclusion. the magazine staff compiled the list and specified that gadgets also needed to be a  self-contained apparatus that can be used on its own  not a subset of another device .   in general we included only items that were potentially mobile   said the magazine.   in the end  we tried to get to the heart of what really makes a gadget a gadget   it concluded. the oldest  gadget  in the top 100 is the abacus  which the magazine dates at 190 a.d.  and put in 60th place. other pre-electronic gadgets in the top 100 include the sextant from 1731 (59th position)  the marine chronometer from 1761 (42nd position) and the kodak brownie camera from 1900 (28th position). the tivo personal video recorder is the newest device to make the top 10  which also includes the first flash mp3 player (diamond multimedia)  as well as the first  successful  digital camera (casio qv-10) and mobile phone (motorola startac). the most popular gadget of the moment  the apple ipod  is at number 12 in the list while the first sony transistor radio is at number 13.  sony s third entry in the top 20 is the cdp-101 cd player from 1983.  who can forget the crystalline  hiss-free blast of madonna s like a virgin emanating from their first cd player   asked the magazine. karl elsener s knife  the swiss army knife from 1891  is at number 20 in the list. gadgets which could be said to feature surprisingly low down in the list include the original telephone (23rd)  the nintendo gameboy (25th)  and the pulsar quartz digital watch (36th). the list also contains plenty of oddities: the pez sweet dispenser (98th)  1990s toy tamagotchi (86th) and the bizarre ronco inside the shell egg scrambler (84th).  almost everyone has a mobile phone  how many people own a powerbook  or an ipod  the findings of this magazine are not very convincing.  what about the magnetic compass  we still use it 1 000 years after it was invented.  i am amazed by the obsession with individual gadgets rather than genre. for example the sony walkman was the first truly portable way of listening to your own music on the move whereas minidisc  flash mp3  portable cd players etc. are really just improvements in technology.  my favourite  true  gadgets are probably my portable minidisc player and the little battery powered whizzy thing i use to froth up my coffee!  calm down it s only in their opinion  and any list that includes the taser in the top 100 gadgets has to be suspect....  swiss army knife and no question about it. how many of the other items are still relatively unchanged from the original idea and still as useful/popular  you don t need a laptop or even a pocket calculator to work that one out!  this list merely illustrates interesting cultural divides between the american authors and the overwhelmingly british responses. brits see no further than mobile phones and the over thirties sinclair; whilst the americans focus on apple  tv remotes and tivo (which probably is rather obscure in europe).  what about the soda stream. this gadget changed my pre-teen life. lap tops may enable you to  think different  but you cant use them to  get busy with the fizzy   how about astro wars  one of the pioneers for computer games  i remember spending many an hour playing this and it still works today! however tried it the other day and it was rubbish  still a great gadget of its time.  why worry about mobile phones. soon they will be subsumed into the pda s / laptops etc.  what about the marine chronometer  completely revolutionised navigation for boats and was in use for centuries. for it s time  a technological marvel!  sony net minidisc! it paved the way for more mp3 player to explode onto the market. i always used my netmd  and could not go anywhere without it.  a laptop computer is not a gadget! it s a working tool!  the sinclair executive was the world s first pocket calculator. i think this should be there as well.  how about the clockwork radio  or gps  or a pocket calculator  all these things are useful to real people  not just pc magazine editors.  are the people who created this list insane   surely the most important gadget of the modern age is the mobile phone  it has revolutionised communication  which is more than can be said for a niche market laptop. from outside the modern age  the marine chronometer is the single most important gadget  without which modern transportation systems would not have evolved so quickly.  has everyone forgot about the breville pie maker    an interesting list. of the electronic gadgets  thousands of journalists in the early 1980s blessed the original noteboook pc - the tandy 100. the size of a4 paper and light  three weeks on a set of batteries  an excellent keyboard  a modem. a pity tandy did not make it dos compatible.  what s an apple powerbook 100   it s out of date - not much of a  gadget . surely it has to be something simple / timeless - the tin opener  swiss army knife  safety razor blade  wristwatch or the thing for taking stones out of horses hooves    it has to be the mobile phone. no other single device has had such an effect on our way of living in such a short space of time.  the ball point pen has got to be one of the most used and common gadgets ever. also many might be grateful for the pocket calculator which was a great improvement over the slide rule.  the casio pocket calculator that played a simple game and made tinny noises was also a hot gadget in 1980. a true gadget  it could be carried around and shown off.  all top 10 are electronic toys  so the list is probably a better reflection of the current high-tech obsession than anything else. i say this as the swiss army knife only made no 20.  sinclair ql a machine far ahead of its time. the first home machine with a true multi-takings os. shame the marketing was so bad!!!  apple.. a triumph of fashion over... well everything else.  utter rubbish. yes  the apple laptop and sony walkman are classic gadgets. but to call the sextant and the marine chronometer  gadgets  and rank them as less important than a tv remote control reveals a quite shocking lack of historical perspective. the former literally helped change the world by vastly improving navigation at see. the latter is the seed around which the couch potato culture has developed. no competition.  i d also put apple s newton and the first palm pilot there as the front runners for portable computing  and possibly the toshiba libretto for the same reason. i only wish that vulcan inc s flipstart wasn t just vapourware otherwise it would be at the top.  how did a laptop ever manage to beat off the challenge of the wristwatch or the telephone (mobile or otherwise)  what about radios and tvs   the swiss army knife. by far the most useful gadget. i got mine 12 years ago. still wearing and using it a lot! it stood the test of time.  psion organiser series 3  should be up there. had a usable qwerty keyboard  removable storage  good set of apps and programmable. case design was good (batteries in the hinge - a first  i think). great product innovation.  the first mobile pc was voted best gadget by readers of...err... mobile pc ! why do you keep putting these obviously biased lists on your site  it s obviously the mobile phone or remote control  and readers of a less partisan publication would tell you that.  the motorola startac should be number one. why  there will be mobile phones long after notebook computers and other gadgets are either gone or integrated in communications devices.  the psion series 3c! the first most practical way to carry all your info around...  i too would back the sinclair spectrum - without this little beauty i would never have moved into the world of it and earn the living that i do now.  i d have put the mobile phone high up the list. probably a nokia model.  sinclair spectrum - 16k. it plugged into the tv. games were rubbish but it gave me a taste for programming and that s what i do for a living now.  i wish more modern notebooks -- even apple s newest offerings -- were more like the pb100. particularly disheartening is the demise of the trackball  which has given way to the largely useless  trackpad  which every notebook on the market today uses. they re invariably inaccurate  uncomfortable  and cumbersome to use.  congratulations to apple  a deserved win!,appl laptop great gadget appl powerbook chosen great gadget time u magazin mobil pc laptop chosen one first

301,2152,lions blow to world cup stars british and irish lions coach clive woodward says he is unlikely to select any players not involved in next year s rbs six nations championship.  world cup winners lawrence dallaglio  neil back and martin johnson had all been thought to be in the frame for next summer s tour to new zealand.  i don t think you can ever say never   said woodward.  but i would have to have a compulsive reason to pick any player who is not available to international rugby.  dallaglio  back and johnson have all retired from international rugby over the last 12 months but continue to star for their club sides. but woodward added:  the key thing that i want to stress is that i intend to use the six nations and the players who are available to international rugby as the key benchmark.  my job  along with all the other senior representatives  is to make sure that we pick the strongest possible team.  if you are not playing international rugby then it s still a step up to test rugby. it s definitely a disadvantage.   i think it s absolutely critical and with the history of the lions we have got to take players playing for the four countries.  woodward also revealed that the race for the captaincy was still wide open.  it is an open book   he said.  there are some outstanding candidates from all four countries.  and following the all blacks  impressive displays in europe in recent weeks  including a 45-6 humiliation of france  woodward believes the three-test series in new zealand will provide the ultimate rugby challenge.  their performance in particular against france was simply awesome   said the lions coach.  certain things have been suggested about the potency of their front five  but they re a very powerful unit.  with his customary thoroughness  woodward revealed he had taken soundings from australia coach eddie jones and jake white of south africa following their tour matches in britain and ireland.  as a result  woodward stressed his lions group might not be dominated by players from england and ireland and held out hope for the struggling scots.  scotland s recent results have not been that impressive but there have been some excellent individual performances.  eddie in particular told me how tough they had made it for australia and i will take on board their opinions.  and scotland forward simon taylor looks certain to get the call  provided he recovers from knee and tendon problems.  i took lessons from 2001 in that they did make a mistake in taking lawrence dallaglio when he wasn t fit and went on the trip.  every player has to be looked at on their own merits and simon taylor is an outstanding player and i have no doubts that if he gets back to full fitness he will be on the trip.  i am told he should be back playing by march and he has plenty of time to prove his fitness for the lions - and there are other players like richard hill in the same boat.,lion blow world cup star british irish lion coach clive woodward say unlik select player involv next year rb six nation championship world cup winner lawrenc dallaglio neil back martin johnson thought frame next summer tour new zealand think ever say never say woodward would compuls reason pick player avail intern rugbi dallaglio back johnson retir intern rugbi last month continu star club side woodward ad key thing want stress intend use six nation player avail intern rugbi key benchmark job along senior repres make sure pick strong possibl team play intern rugbi still step test rugbi definit disadvantag think absolut critic histori lion get take player play four countri woodward also reveal race captainci still wide open open book say outstand candid four countri follow black impress display europ recent week includ humili franc woodward believ threetest seri new zealand provid ultim rugbi challeng perform particular franc simpli awesom say lion coach certain thing suggest potenc front five power unit customari thorough woodward reveal take sound australia coach eddi jone jake white south africa follow tour match britain ireland result woodward stress lion group might domin player england ireland held hope struggl scot scotland recent result impress excel individu perform eddi particular told tough make australia take board opinion scotland forward simon taylor look certain get call provid recov knee tendon problem take lesson make mistak take lawrenc dallaglio fit go trip everi player look merit simon taylor outstand player doubt get back full fit trip told back play march plenti time prove fit lion player like richard hill boat

306,1372,concerns at school diploma plan final appeals are being made for the government not to ditch the reform plan for england s secondary schools put forward by the tomlinson report.  the government s response to the plan for a four-tier diploma to replace all existing 14-19 qualifications is expected next week. some are worried it could be scuppered if  as tony blair and ruth kelly have suggested  gcses and a-levels stay. sir mike tomlinson himself was briefed only this week. he is said to be feeling more comfortable about what the government is likely to say than if he had read only what was in newspapers in the earlier part of the week. but the government was said to be still rewriting its response on friday.  it will be a tragedy if the government comes through with a half-hearted response   said the chairman of the commons education select committee  labour mp barry sheerman.  his main concern was the reports that there would be a diploma - but only to replace existing vocational qualifications.  we must tackle head-on the structural mess that is our secondary education system   he wrote in the times educational supplement.  it is not the case that the academic stream in secondary is fine while the vocational route is desperately weak.  the qualifications and curriculum authority (qca) has also told the government not to  compromise . the qca said the potential  step-change in participation and attainment  lay in the integrity of the whole diploma.  any partial implementation of the proposals would  in our view  compromise that integrity   said its chairman  sir anthony greener. it is a sign of the qca s concern that its advice went to ministers last december but was publicised only recently. but people understand that a white paper response is government policy and has to command wider ministerial support than if it were coming only from the department for education and skills. they may be content if it does not  close too many doors  in writing - whatever spin is put on it.  the chief inspector of schools  david bell  also said recently that gcses and a-levels should go.  one of the reasons why i m so strongly in favour of these terms disappearing over time is that it s good for the symbols of change to be seen right across the system   he said.  if we don t say this is a sea-change in education  we will miss a great opportunity.  universities and head teachers in both the independent and state sectors have also backed the tomlinson proposals  which include having higher grades at advanced level to differentiate between the brightest students. a note of concern has been expressed repeatedly by the employers  organisation  the cbi  which complains of a lack of skills. in an attempt to address this  the tomlinson plan is for tests in  functional  maths and literacy - decidedly not gcses. it has been suggested the government will take steps of some sort to meet firms  concerns on this score. another dissenter is sir mike tomlinson s predecessor as chief schools inspector  professor chris woodhead  who has said there is no need for such a  massive upheaval . the conservative party has put forward plans to revert to a system of having only the brightest percentage of students each year getting the top a-level grade  no matter how well the others have done.,concern school diploma plan final appeal make govern ditch reform plan england secondari school put forward tomlinson report govern respons plan fourtier diploma replac exist qualif expect next week worri could scupper toni blair ruth kelli suggest gcse alevel stay sir mike tomlinson brief week say feel comfort govern like say read newspap earlier part week govern say still rewrit respons friday tragedi govern come halfheart respons say chairman common educ select committe labour mp barri sheerman main concern report would diploma replac exist vocat qualif must tackl headon structur mess secondari educ system write time educ supplement case academ stream secondari fine vocat rout desper weak qualif curriculum author qca also told govern compromis qca say potenti stepchang particip attain lay integr whole diploma partial implement propos would view compromis integr say chairman sir anthoni greener sign qca concern advic go minist last decemb publicis recent peopl understand white paper respons govern polici command wider ministeri support come depart educ skill may content close mani door write whatev spin put chief inspector school david bell also say recent gcse alevel go one reason strongli favour term disappear time good symbol chang see right across system say say seachang educ miss great opportun univers head teacher independ state sector also back tomlinson propos includ high grade advanc level differenti brightest student note concern express repeatedli employ organis cbi complain lack skill attempt address tomlinson plan test function math literaci decidedli gcse suggest govern take step sort meet firm concern score anoth dissent sir mike tomlinson predecessor chief school inspector professor chri woodhead say need massiv upheav conserv parti put forward plan revert system brightest percentag student year get top alevel grade matter well other do

314,1648,game makers get xbox 2 sneak peek microsoft has given game makers a glimpse of the new xbox 2 console.  some details of the xbox s performance and what gaming will be like with the device were given at the annual game developers conference in the us. xbox frontman j. allard said the console looked set to be capable of one trillion calculations per second. also all titles for the new xbox will have the same interface to make it easy to play online and buy extras for characters or other add-ons for games.  microsoft is saving the official unveiling of the xbox 2  codenamed xenon  for the e3 show in may and the device could be on shop shelves by november. however  during his keynote speech at gdc mr allard  who heads development of game-making tools for the console  gave a glimpse into how some of its core software will work. he said gaming was entering a  high-definition  era that demanded detailed and convincing graphics that could adequately compete with the hdtv people were starting to watch as well as the hd dvds that will soon start to appear.  industry watchers took this to mean that the xbox 2 will push for hdtv quality graphics as standard as well as multi-channel audio to give gamers an authentic experience. mr allard said microsoft had to work hard to ensure that it was easy for game makers to produce titles for the xbox 2 and for players to get playing. to this end microsoft was building in to xbox hardware systems to support headset chat  buddy list controls and custom soundtracks so developers were free to concentrate on the games. the xbox would also support well-known industry specifications  such as directx  to make it simple for game studios to make titles for the console. for gamers this emphasis on ease of use would mean every xbox title uses the same interface to set up online play and get at music stored on the hardware. this interface will hold details of a player s statistics and skill level on a  gamer card  as well as give access to a store where people can spend small amounts of cash to buy extras for their avatars or add-ons  such as new maps or vehicles  for games they possess. this ability to personalise games and in-game characters would be key in the future  said mr allard. only with such consistency would the xbox be able to support the 10-20 million subscribers that it was aiming for  said mr allard. during his speech mr allard took several swipes at the playstation and said processors for consoles had to be made with developers  not just engineers  in mind.  our approach is bruce lee  not brute force   he said.,game maker get xbox sneak peek microsoft give game maker glimps new xbox consol detail xbox perform game like devic give annual game develop confer u xbox frontman j allard say consol look set capabl one trillion calcul per second also titl new xbox interfac make easi play onlin buy extra charact addon game microsoft save offici unveil xbox codenam xenon e show may devic could shop shelv novemb howev keynot speech gdc mr allard head develop gamemak tool consol give glimps core softwar work say game enter highdefinit era demand detail convinc graphic could adequ compet hdtv peopl start watch well hd dvd soon start appear industri watcher take mean xbox push hdtv qualiti graphic standard well multichannel audio give gamer authent experi mr allard say microsoft work hard ensur easi game maker produc titl xbox player get play end microsoft build xbox hardwar system support headset chat buddi list control custom soundtrack develop free concentr game xbox would also support wellknown industri specif directx make simpl game studio make titl consol gamer emphasi ea use would mean everi xbox titl use interfac set onlin play get music store hardwar interfac hold detail player statist skill level gamer card well give access store peopl spend small amount cash buy extra avatar addon new map vehicl game posse abil personalis game ingam charact would key futur say mr allard consist would xbox abl support million subscrib aim say mr allard speech mr allard take sever swipe playstat say processor consol make develop engin mind approach bruce lee brute forc say
315,410,eu aiming to fuel development aid european union finance ministers meet on thursday to discuss proposals  including a tax on jet fuel  to boost development aid for poorer nations.  the policy makers are to ask for a report into how more development money can be raised  the eu said. the world s richest countries have said they want to increase the amount of aid they give to 0.7% of their annual gross national income by 2015. airlines have reacted strongly against the proposed fuel levy.  profits have been under pressure in the airline industry  with low-cost firms driving down prices and demand dipping after the 11 september terrorist attacks and the outbreak of the killer sars virus.  things have picked up  but some european and us companies are teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. at present  the fuel used by airlines enjoys either a very low tax rate or is untaxed in eu member states.  of course we applaud humanitarian initiatives  but why target the airlines   said ulrich schulte-strathaus  secretary general of the association of european airlines.  our industry is in the midst of a fundamental crisis...only to be once again confronted with a measure designed to increase our costs   he continued.  the eu sought to allay the airlines  fears  stressing that thursday s meeting was only a first step and that other proposals were also under consideration. it added that any plan to levy taxes on jet fuel  should not hinder the competitiveness of the airlines and that they themselves will not be solely funding development . any tax would only be implemented after full consultation with the airlines  the eu said. there is thought to be widespread support for the plan - tabled by france and germany following the recent g7 meeting of the world s richest nations - from eu ministers. the issue of poverty in africa and south asia has forced itself to the top of the politicial agenda  with politicians and campaigners calling for more to be done. at their meeting in london  g7 finance ministers backed plans to write off up to 100% of the debts of some of the world s poorest countries.,eu aim fuel develop aid european union financ minist meet thursday discus propos includ tax jet fuel boost develop aid poorer nation polici maker ask report develop money rais eu say world richest countri say want increas amount aid give annual gross nation incom airlin react strongli propos fuel levi profit pressur airlin industri lowcost firm drive price demand dip septemb terrorist attack outbreak killer sar viru thing pick european u compani teeter brink bankruptci present fuel use airlin enjoy either low tax rate untax eu member state cours applaud humanitarian initi target airlin say ulrich schultestrathau secretari gener associ european airlin industri midst fundament crisisonli confront measur design increas cost continu eu sought allay airlin fear stress thursday meet first step propos also consider ad plan levi tax jet fuel hinder competit airlin sole fund develop tax would implement full consult airlin eu say thought widespread support plan tabl franc germani follow recent g meet world richest nation eu minist issu poverti africa south asia forc top politici agenda politician campaign call do meet london g financ minist back plan write debt world poorest countri
316,1819,warnings on woeful wi-fi security companies are getting worse at keeping their wireless data networks secure.  a survey of wi-fi networks in london  frankfurt  new york and san francisco by rsa security found more than a third had basic security features turned off. by contrast last year s survey found that 15% of firms had failed to take basic steps to improve security. rsa warned that wi-fi s growing popularity made it much more likely that insecure networks would be found and exploited.  wireless or wi-fi networks have become hugely popular over the last few years in offices because they are easy to set up and make going online much more convenient. this popularity shows no sign of slowing reveals the annual rsa security and netsurity survey which found an annual 66% growth rate in the number of wireless nets being installed in london and frankfurt. although most firms do take steps to turn on the security functions built in to the wi-fi standard and protect themselves from attack  the survey found that a significant proportion were taking unnecessary risks. on average 33% of the wireless networks found by rsa and netsurity researchers in london  frankfurt  new york and san francisco had not used basic security systems. many firms were simply turning on their wireless net access points and use default settings that anyone familiar with wi-fi could easily find out. rsa said that 26% of wi-fi networks found london used default settings compared to 30% in frankfurt  31% in new york and 28% in san francisco. many users of wi-fi nets did not even turn on the encryption that scrambles data traffic between users and the access point helping them go online. this is despite a series of stories warning firms about the dangers of  drive-by hacking  in which computer criminals walk or drive around city centres using easy to use tools to spot wi-fi nets.  these figures are another stark warning to unsecured businesses to get their act together   said phil cracknell  chief technology officer at netsurity. as more public wi-fi hotspots appear and people become more familiar with using them  it was getting more likely that insecure would be found  warned mr cracknell.  accidental or intentional connection to a corporate network can bring with it a series of security issues including loss of confidential data and installation of malicious code   he said.,warn woeful wifi secur compani get wors keep wireless data network secur survey wifi network london frankfurt new york san francisco rsa secur found third basic secur featur turn contrast last year survey found firm fail take basic step improv secur rsa warn wifi grow popular make much like insecur network would found exploit wireless wifi network becom huge popular last year offic easi set make go onlin much conveni popular show sign slow reveal annual rsa secur netsur survey found annual growth rate number wireless net instal london frankfurt although firm take step turn secur function built wifi standard protect attack survey found signific proport take unnecessari risk averag wireless network found rsa netsur research london frankfurt new york san francisco use basic secur system mani firm simpli turn wireless net access point use default set anyon familiar wifi could easili find rsa say wifi network found london use default set compar frankfurt new york san francisco mani user wifi net even turn encrypt scrambl data traffic user access point help go onlin despit seri stori warn firm danger drivebi hack comput crimin walk drive around citi centr use easi use tool spot wifi net figur anoth stark warn unsecur busi get act togeth say phil cracknel chief technolog offic netsur public wifi hotspot appear peopl becom familiar use get like insecur would found warn mr cracknel accident intent connect corpor network bring seri secur issu includ loss confidenti data instal malici code say
317,229,tv s future down the phone line internet tv has been talked about since the start of the web as we know it now.  but any early attempts to do it - the uk s home choice started in 1992 - were thwarted by the lack of a fast network. now that broadband networks are bedding down  and it is becoming essential for millions  the big telcos are keen to start shooting video down the line. in the face of competition from cable companies offering net voice calls  they are keen to be the top iptv dogs. software giant microsoft thinks iptv - internet protocol tv - is the future of television  and it sits neatly with its vision of the  connected entertainment experience .  telcos have been wanting to do video for a long time   ed graczyk  director of marketing for microsoft iptv  told the bbc news website.  the challenge has been the broadband network  and the state of technology up until not so long ago did not add up to a feasible solution.  compression technology was not efficient enough  the net was not good enough. a lot of stars have aligned in the last 18 months to make it a reality.   last year  he said  was all about deal making and partnering up; shaping the  iptv ecosystem . this year  those deals will start to play out and more services will come online.  2006 is where it starts ramping up and expanding to other geographies - over time as broadband becomes more prevalent in south america  and other parts of asia  it will expand   he added. what telcos really want to do is to send the  triple-play  of video  voice  and data down one single line  be it cable or dsl (digital subscriber line). some are talking about  quadruple play   too  with mobile services added into the mix. it is an emerging new breed of competition for satellite and cable broadcasters and operators. according to technology analysts  tdg research  there will be 20 million subscribers to iptv services in under six years.  key to the appeal of sending tv programmes down the same line as the web data  whenever a viewer wants it  is that it uses the same technology as the internet. it means there is not just a one-way relationship between the viewer and the  broadcaster . this allows for more dvd-like interactivity  limitless storage and broadcast space  bespoke channel  playlists   and thousands of hours of programmes or films at a viewer s fingertips. it potentially lets operators target programmes to smaller  niche or localised audiences  sending films to bollywood fans for instance  as well as individual devices.  operators could also send high-definition programmes straight to the viewer  bypassing the need for a special broadcast receiver. perhaps most compelling - yet some might say insignificant - is instantaneous channel flicking. currently  there is a delay when you try to do this on satellite  cable or freeview. with iptv  the speed is 15 milliseconds.  that gets rounds of applause   according to mr graczyk. microsoft is one of the companies that started thinking about iptv some time ago.  we believe this will be the way all tv is delivered in the future - but that is several years away   said mr graczyk.  as with music  tv has moved to digital formats.  the things software can do to integrate media into devices means a whole new generation of connected entertainment experiences that cross devices from the tv  to the mobile  to the gaming console and so on.  the company intends its microsoft s iptv edition software  an end-to-end management and delivery platform  to let telcos to do exactly that  seamlessly. it has netted seven major telcos as customers  representing a potential audience of 25 million existing broadband subscribers. its deal with us telco sbc was the largest tv software deal to date  said mr graczyk.  iptv is about more than telcos  though. there are several web-based offerings that aim to put control in the hands of the consumer by exploiting the net s power. jeremy allaire  chief of brightcove  told the bbc news website that it would be a flavour of iptv that was about harnessing the web as a  channel .   it is not just niches  but about exploiting content not usually viewed   he said.  we are focussed on the owners of video content who have rights to digitally distribute content  and who often see unencumbered distribution.  for them to do it through cable and so on is price-prohibitive   he said. this type of iptv service might also be a distribution channel for more established publishers who have unique types of content that they cannot offer through cable and satellite operators - history channel archives  for instance. what is a clear sign that iptv has a future is that microsoft is not the only player in the field. there are a lot of other  middleware  players providing similar management services as microsoft  like myrio and c-cor. but it will up to the viewer to decide if it really is to be successful.,tv futur phone line internet tv talk sinc start web know earli attempt uk home choic start thwart lack fast network broadband network bed becom essenti million big telco keen start shoot video line face competit cabl compani offer net voic call keen top iptv dog softwar giant microsoft think iptv internet protocol tv futur televis sit neatli vision connect entertain experi telco want video long time ed graczyk director market microsoft iptv told bbc news websit challeng broadband network state technolog long ago add feasibl solut compress technolog effici enough net good enough lot star align last month make realiti last year say deal make partner shape iptv ecosystem year deal start play servic come onlin start ramp expand geographi time broadband becom preval south america part asia expand ad telco realli want send tripleplay video voic data one singl line cabl dsl digit subscrib line talk quadrupl play mobil servic ad mix emerg new breed competit satellit cabl broadcast oper accord technolog analyst tdg research million subscrib iptv servic six year key appeal send tv programm line web data whenev viewer want use technolog internet mean oneway relationship viewer broadcast allow dvdlike interact limitless storag broadcast space bespok channel playlist thousand hour programm film viewer fingertip potenti let oper target programm small nich localis audienc send film bollywood fan instanc well individu devic oper could also send highdefinit programm straight viewer bypass need special broadcast receiv perhap compel yet might say insignific instantan channel flick current delay tri satellit cabl freeview iptv speed millisecond get round applaus accord mr graczyk microsoft one compani start think iptv time ago believ way tv deliv futur sever year away say mr graczyk music tv move digit format thing softwar integr medium devic mean whole new gener connect entertain experi cross devic tv mobil game consol compani intend microsoft iptv edit softwar endtoend manag deliveri platform let telco exactli seamlessli net seven major telco custom repres potenti audienc million exist broadband subscrib deal u telco sbc large tv softwar deal date say mr graczyk iptv telco though sever webbas offer aim put control hand consum exploit net power jeremi allair chief brightcov told bbc news websit would flavour iptv har web channel nich exploit content usual view say focus owner video content right digit distribut content often see unencumb distribut cabl priceprohibit say type iptv servic might also distribut channel establish publish uniqu type content offer cabl satellit oper histori channel archiv instanc clear sign iptv futur microsoft player field lot middlewar player provid similar manag servic microsoft like myrio ccor viewer decid realli success
318,252,federer joins all-time greats the last year has seen one player dominate men s tennis  and one country dominate the women s game.  roger federer became the first man since mats wilander in 1988 to win three grand slams in one season. and after anastasia myskina became the first russian woman to win a grand slam at the french open  two more followed at wimbledon and the us open. meanwhile  briton tim henman enjoyed his best year  while greg rusedski fought back superbly from adversity. federer began the year as world number one and holder of the wimbledon and masters cup titles  and set about conquering new ground. the swiss sounded warning of the dominance to come at the australian open.  he ripped through the draw before beating marat safin in the final. andy roddick was the only player to put up any real resistance at wimbledon  and federer s performance against lleyton hewitt in the us open final was breathtaking. federer again got the better of hewitt in the season-ending masters cup. his victory in houston proved to be his 13th successive win in a final  an open era record. the only major let-down was a third-round loss to gustavo kuerten at the french open  and roland garros will be his main target in 2005.  there was also a surprise loss to the unheralded tomas berdych at the olympic games  which saw chile dominate as nicoals massu took the singles and then paired up with fernando gonzaelz to win doubles gold. another major trophy that looks beyond federer is the davis cup  which was won by spain in a 3-2 home success over the usa in seville. roddick struggled on the clay  losing to rafael nadal on the opening day before going down to carlos moya in the all-important fourth rubber.  henman broke new ground by reaching the semis on clay at the french open - a stunning effort - and also at the us open. a quarter-final defeat to mario ancic at wimbledon was disappointing for the limp manner of the briton s defeat  but he remains optimistic of going further next year.  british number two rusedski endured a rollercoaster year  returning to the circuit after being cleared of a doping offence in march. with his ranking down at 168  many feared the 31-year-old s career was over  but he battled back in the second half of the season to re-enter the top 50. the russian women finally delivered on their long-recognised promise in 2004  with myskina  maria sharapova and svetlana kuznetsova winning grand slams  before taking the season-ending fed cup. but while the young russians were on the way up  it was a different story for the belgians and the williams sisters. only veteran lindsay davenport held the new wave at bay  a stunning run of form after wimbledon taking her to number one ahead of amelie mauresmo  whose grand slam drought goes on. the year started in regulation fashion as justine henin-hardenne beat compatriot kim clijsters at the australian open.  a virus ruined the rest of henin-hardenne s year  although she was fit enough to win olympic gold  but clijsters had an even more miserable 2004. she suffered a serious wrist injury and then announced the end of her relationship with lleyton hewitt  and will be happy to see the year end. in their absence  myskina thrashed elena dementieva in a historic  but woeful  all-russian final at the french open. wimbledon was a more refreshing affair as sharapova captivated sw19  showing nerves of steel as she battled past davenport and serena williams to take the title.  davenport was a strong favourite for the us open but  hampered by injury  lost to the powerful and unflappable kuznetsova in the semis. kuznetsova went on to give dementieva another grand slam final thrashing  with the latter s wayward serve becoming one of the talking points of the year. with the russians still improving  the likes of henin-hardenne  clijsters  davenport  mauresmo  venus and serena will need to be fully fit and motivated in 2005. and it may take their compatriot safin to challenge federer on the men s side.,feder join alltim great last year see one player domin men tenni one countri domin woman game roger feder becam first man sinc mat wiland win three grand slam one season anastasia myskina becam first russian woman win grand slam french open two follow wimbledon u open meanwhil briton tim henman enjoy best year greg rusedski fought back superbl advers feder begin year world number one holder wimbledon master cup titl set conquer new ground swiss sound warn domin come australian open rip draw beat marat safin final andi roddick player put real resist wimbledon feder perform lleyton hewitt u open final breathtak feder get well hewitt seasonend master cup victori houston prove th success win final open era record major letdown thirdround loss gustavo kuerten french open roland garro main target also surpris loss unherald toma berdych olymp game saw chile domin nicoal massu take singl pair fernando gonzaelz win doubl gold anoth major trophi look beyond feder davi cup spain home success usa sevil roddick struggl clay lose rafael nadal open day go carlo moya allimport fourth rubber henman broke new ground reach semi clay french open stun effort also u open quarterfin defeat mario ancic wimbledon disappoint limp manner briton defeat remain optimist go next year british number two rusedski endur rollercoast year return circuit clear dope offenc march rank mani fear yearold career battl back second half season reenter top russian woman final deliv longrecognis promis myskina maria sharapova svetlana kuznetsova win grand slam take seasonend fed cup young russian way differ stori belgian william sister veteran lindsay davenport held new wave bay stun run form wimbledon take number one ahead ameli mauresmo whose grand slam drought goe year start regul fashion justin heninhardenn beat compatriot kim clijster australian open viru ruin rest heninhardenn year although fit enough win olymp gold clijster even miser suffer seriou wrist injuri announc end relationship lleyton hewitt happi see year end absenc myskina thrash elena dementieva histor woeful allrussian final french open wimbledon refresh affair sharapova captiv sw show nerv steel battl past davenport serena william take titl davenport strong favourit u open hamper injuri lose power unflapp kuznetsova semi kuznetsova go give dementieva anoth grand slam final thrash latter wayward serv becom one talk point year russian still improv like heninhardenn clijster davenport mauresmo venu serena need fulli fit motiv may take compatriot safin challeng feder men side

321,951,uk  discriminated against roma  the government s immigration rules racially discriminated against roma (gypsies) seeking entry into the uk  the law lords have ruled.  it follows a home office move to cut asylum claims by stopping people  mostly roma  from boarding flights to britain from the czech capital  prague. civil rights group liberty said it exposed  racism at the heart of the government s asylum policy . the home office said it had not meant to discriminate against anyone. it said it would look at the implications of the ruling  but pointed out the controls were no longer in place because czechs are now entitled to free movement across europe.  the screening took place at the airport in july 2001  at a time of concern about the number of asylum seekers entering britain.  those refused  pre-clearance  were effectively prevented from travelling to the uk  because no airline would carry them. lady hale  sitting with lords bingham  steyn  hope and carswell  said many roma had good reason to want to leave the czech republic because of persecution. but she said they were treated more sceptically than non-roma passengers by immigration officers  acting on racial grounds . lady hale said immigration officers should have treated all would-be passengers in the same way  only using more intrusive questioning if there was a specific reason.  liberty said statistics suggested roma czechs were 400 times more likely to be stopped by british immigration officials at prague airport than non-roma czechs. it took up the case of six unnamed roma czechs refused entry to britain  and that of the european roma rights centre  which said the measures unfairly penalised roma people. it lost a high court action in october 2002 when a judge said the system was  no more or less objectionable  than a visa control system. he ruled there was no obligation on britain not to take steps to prevent a potential refugee from approaching its border to claim asylum.  the court of appeal then decided the practice almost inevitably discriminated against roma  but that this was justified because they were more likely to seek asylum. immigration law allows officials to discriminate against citizens from named countries  but it does not allow officers to go further than that.  responding to the ruling  a home office spokesman said:  the scheme was operated two years ago as a short-term response to the high levels of passengers travelling from prague who are subsequently found to be ineligible for entry to the uk.   welcoming the ruling  maeve sherlock  chief executive of the refugee council  said:  human rights abuses against the roma in eastern europe are well documented  and it is hugely troubling that the government sought to deny entry to such a vulnerable group.  amnesty international s jan shaw said:  that the government s own asylum policy was being operated discriminatorily is bleakly ironic given that discrimination often lies at the heart of serious human rights abuse  not least in the czech republic.  but the chairman of migration watch uk  sir andrew green  said the house of lords decision was a  step in the wrong direction .  the basic point is that the government has a duty to control our borders and this decision appears to extend the race relations legislation beyond sensible limits.,uk discrimin rom govern

322,212,straw attacked on china arms moves to lift the european union s ban on arms exports to china have been condemned by human rights groups and the conservatives.  the 15 year embargo was imposed in the aftermath of china s crackdown on protesters in tiananmen square in 1989. uk foreign secretary jack straw  who will hold talks in beijing on thursday  said an eu arms code was more effective than the current ban. but human rights watch says the eu is putting commerce above abuse concerns.  in december  the eu pledged to work towards lifting the ban but said it was not ready to do so yet. germany and france have repeatedly called for the embargo to be lifted. britain has been more cautious but mr straw last week said he also wanted it to end  despite us objections.  he expects it to be lifted over the next six months  a prediction which has alarmed critics. brad adams  from human rights watch  said:  this is a huge political signal from europe that they are willing to forget about tiananmen square.  there are still thousands of people who are unaccounted for.   mr straw said it was wrong to put china under the same embargo as countries such as zimbabwe and burma. the scope of the embargo was very narrow and did not have any force of law behind it  he told bbc radio 4 s world at one. in the uk  more export licences were refused under the existing european union arms code than under the embargo  he said. and only two of the licences denied under the embargo would have been granted under the code.  the code of conduct is much more effective  it s a more powerful tool of and we intend to strengthen it as a pre-condition of lifting the embargo with china   he said.  mr straw denied the decision would suggest to china that tiananmen square had been forgotten. the level of human rights was a key criteria under the eu arms exports code  he said. human rights groups say the code of conduct is not legally binding - but mr straw said it would be given legal force by the laws of many eu countries. conservative shadow foreign secretary michael ancram said the move would be  profoundly wrong . the decision could undermine nato as it severely damaged relations with the us  which is opposed to ending the ban.  mr ancram argued:  what the british government is doing is giving in to french and german pressure  especially the french  who see vast contracts available to them if the embargo is lifted...  it gives the wrong signals to china  who are simply not prepared to accept that what happened at tiananmen square was wrong.  mr straw s china trip is part of regular high-level meetings with beijing ministers. he will meet chinese counterpart minister li zhaoxing to discuss developing relations between their two countries  hong kong and china s part in the talks on north korea.,straw attack china arm move lift european union ban arm export china condemn human right group conserv year embargo impos aftermath china crackdown protest tiananmen squar uk foreign secretari jack straw hold talk beij thursday say eu arm code effect current ban human right watch say eu put commerc abus concern decemb eu pledg work toward lift ban say readi yet germani franc repeatedli call embargo lift britain cautiou mr straw last week say also want end despit u object expect lift next six month predict alarm critic brad adam human right watch say huge polit signal europ will forget tiananmen squar still thousand peopl unaccount mr straw say wrong put china embargo countri zimbabw burma scope embargo narrow forc law behind told bbc radio world one uk export licenc refus exist european union arm code embargo say two licenc deni embargo would grant code code conduct much effect power tool intend strengthen precondit lift embargo china say mr straw deni decis would suggest china tiananmen squar forgotten level human right key criterion eu arm export code say human right group say code conduct legal bind mr straw say would give legal forc law mani eu countri conserv shadow foreign secretari michael ancram say move would profoundli wrong decis could undermin nato sever damag relat u oppos end ban mr ancram argu british govern give french german pressur especi french see vast contract avail embargo lift give wrong signal china simpli prepar accept happen tiananmen squar wrong mr straw china trip part regular highlevel meet beij minist meet chine counterpart minist li zhaox discus develop relat two countri hong kong china part talk north korea
323,1758,nuclear body seeks new tech the computer systems used to monitor the world s nuclear power installations are so outdated that they are hampering the work of inspectors.  a spokesman for the international atomic energy agency (iaea) said its current technology could allow key information to be overlooked as it was more than 20 years old. such systems are the only method of tracking nuclear material worldwide. the agency has appealed for more funds to update its hardware and software.  a major overhaul of the system is needed to allow inspectors immediate  secure online access to information   said project manager livio costantini.  iaea inspectors make around 3 000 visits a year to more than 900 nuclear facilities worldwide. they are there to verify official reports of activities in the plants  to carry out environmental checks  and also to look for any signs that nuclear material is being smuggled in or out of the facility.  the computer system inspectors currently use for comparing data from earlier visits  for instance  was built in the 1970s and largely paper based. an iaea spokesman said this was extremely inefficient and makes searching for anomalies like searching for a needle in a haystack. the organisation is aiming to start a system upgrade in november  aiming to provide inspectors in the field with secure online access to previous inspection data  design blueprints of nuclear facilities  even satellite images of the plant. where possible  it hopes to link the system with national records of the import and export of nuclear materials. further analysis of these could help spot potential smuggling activities or illicit technology transfers between countries  according to a spokesman.  computer specialist at the iaea  peter smith  would like to be able to incorporate state of the art visualisation techniques  more familiar to video games players  into the inspector s toolkit.  the commercials you now see have people are moving around in a virtual world   he said.  if we could have that on our laptops  we could be walking through the plant seeing  on the laptop  how the plant should look.  and if there s a door in the wall that is not on our laptop  then we have a problem.  the iaea estimates the total cost of the four-year project to upgrade its technology will be $40m. so far it has only received $11m from the us and the uk.  failure to replace the hardware and software  and to integrate fully all the information system components will carry large risks   said an agency statement.,nuclear bodi seek new tech comput system use monitor world nuclear power instal outdat hamper work inspector spokesman intern atom energi agenc iaea say current technolog could allow key inform overlook year old system method track nuclear materi worldwid agenc appeal fund updat hardwar softwar major overhaul system need allow inspector immedi secur onlin access inform say project manag livio costantini iaea inspector make around visit year nuclear facil worldwid verifi offici report activ plant carri environment check also look sign nuclear materi smuggl facil comput system inspector current use compar data earlier visit instanc built s larg paper base iaea spokesman say extrem ineffici make search anomali like search needl haystack organis aim start system upgrad novemb aim provid inspector field secur onlin access previou inspect data design blueprint nuclear facil even satellit imag plant possibl hope link system nation record import export nuclear materi analysi could help spot potenti smuggl activ illicit technolog transfer countri accord spokesman comput specialist iaea peter smith would like abl incorpor state art visualis techniqu familiar video game player inspector toolkit commerci see peopl move around virtual world say could laptop could walk plant see laptop plant look door wall laptop problem iaea estim total cost fouryear project upgrad technolog m far receiv m u uk failur replac hardwar softwar integr fulli inform system compon carri larg risk say agenc statement
324,238,brewers  profits lose their fizz heineken and carlsberg  two of the world s largest brewers  have reported falling profits after beer sales in western europe fell flat.  dutch firm heineken saw its annual profits drop 33% and warned that earnings in 2005 may also slide. danish brewer carlsberg suffered a 3% fall in profits due to waning demand and increased marketing costs. both are looking to russia and china to provide future growth as western european markets are largely mature.  heineken s net income fell to 537m euros ($701m; £371m) during 2004  from 798m euro a year ago. it blamed weak demand in western europe and currency losses. it had warned in september that the weakening us dollar  which has cut the value of foreign sales  would knock 125m euros off its operating profits. despite the dip in profits  heineken s sales have been improving and total revenue for the year was 10bn euros  up 8.1% from 9.26bn euros in 2003. heineken said it now plans to invest 100m euros in  aggressive  and  high-impact  marketing in europe and the us in 2005. heineken  which also owns the amstel and murphy s stout brands  said it would also seek to cut costs. this may involve closing down breweries.  heineken increased its dividend payment by 25% to 40 euro cents  but warned that the continued impact of a weaker dollar and an increased marketing spend may lead to a drop in 2005 net profit.  carlsberg  the world s fifth-largest brewer  saw annual pre-tax profits fall to 3.4bn danish kroner (456m euros). its beer sales have been affected by the sluggish european economy and by the banning of smoking in pubs in several european countries. nevertheless  total sales increased 4% to 36bn kroner  thanks to strong sales of carlsberg lager in russia and poland. carlsberg is more optimistic than heineken about 2005  projecting a 15% rise in net profits for the year. however  it also plans to cut 200 jobs in sweden  where sales have been hit by demand for cheap  imported brands.  we remain cautious about the medium-to-long term outlook for revenue growth across western europe for a host of economic  social and structural reasons   investment bank merrill lynch said of carlsberg.,brewer profit lose fizz heineken carlsberg two world large brewer report fall profit beer sale western europ fell flat dutch firm heineken saw annual profit drop warn earn may also slide danish brewer carlsberg suffer fall profit due wane demand increas market cost look russia china provid futur growth western european market larg matur heineken net incom fell m euro m £m m euro year ago blame weak demand western europ currenc loss warn septemb weaken u dollar cut valu foreign sale would knock m euro oper profit despit dip profit heineken sale improv total revenu year bn euro bn euro heineken say plan invest m euro aggress highimpact market europ u heineken also own amstel murphi stout brand say would also seek cut cost may involv close breweri heineken increas dividend payment euro cent warn continu impact weaker dollar increas market spend may lead drop net profit carlsberg world fifthlargest brewer saw annual pretax profit fall bn danish krone m euro beer sale affect sluggish european economi ban smoke pub sever european countri nevertheless total sale increas bn krone thank strong sale carlsberg lager russia poland carlsberg optimist heineken project rise net profit year howev also plan cut job sweden sale hit demand cheap import brand remain cautiou mediumtolong term outlook revenu growth across western europ host econom social structur reason invest bank merril lynch say carlsberg
325,893,rangers seal old firm win goals from gregory vignal and nacho novo gave rangers a scrappy victory at celtic park that moves them three points clear of the champions.  rangers had rarely threatened until celtic goalkeeper rab douglas let defender vignal s 25-yard drive slip through his grasp and into the net. opposite number ronald waterreus had been rangers  hero  saving superbly from craig bellamy and john hartson. striker novo secured victory  lobbing douglas with eight minutes remaining. it ended celtic s 11-game unbeaten run at home in old firm derbies and gave rangers manager alex mcleish his first victory at the home of his glasgow rivals. celtic had won their last six meetings on their home pitch  including twice already this season. they started confidently  with new signing bellamy  on loan from newcastle united  given his celtic debut up front with wales international colleague john hartson and chris sutton dropping into midfield. it took bellamy just four minutes to threaten  taking on marvin andrews before delivering a low drive that was held by waterreus at the second attempt. he had an even better chance after hartson dispossesed sotiris kyrgiakos and sent his strike partner clear with only the goalkeeper to beat. but waterreus did well to beat away bellamy s disappointing low drive from 16 yards. waterreus came to the rescue again when the ball fell to hartson just inside the box and the dutch goalkeeper made a brave block. it was an old firm return for barry ferguson as mcleish stuck by the side that thumped four goals past hibernian. but rangers found celtic harder to break down and douglas was not threatened until 10 minutes after the break. dado prso turned inside neil lennon only for the celtic goalkeeper to beat away his powerful 18-yard drive. a great defensive header by andrews prevented hartson pouncing from five yards out. hartson foxed vignal at the edge of the rangers box  but the striker s shot on the turn was again beaten away by waterreus. rangers were beginning to dominate the midfield and vignal  collecting a knock back from fernando ricksen  broke the deadlock  douglas somehow letting the frenchman s dipping drive slip through his grasp. novo pounced on a moments  hesitation in the celtic defence to latch on to a long ball from ricksen and lob the ball over the advancing douglas. ricksen appeared to be hit by a coin  but it could not prevent rangers  celebrations at the final whistle.  : douglas  mcnamara  balde  varga  laursen  petrov  lennon  sutton  thompson  bellamy  hartson.  subs: marshall  henchoz  juninho paulista  lambert  maloney  wallace  mcgeady.  : waterreus  hutton  kyrgiakos  andrews  ball  buffel  ferguson  ricksen  vignal  prso  novo.  subs: mcgregor  namouchi  burke  alex rae  malcolm  thompson  lovenkrands.  : m mccurry,ranger seal old firm win goal gregori vignal nacho novo give ranger scrappi victori celtic park move three point clear champion ranger rare threaten celtic goalkeep rab dougla let defend vignal yard drive slip grasp net opposit number ronald waterreu ranger hero save superbl craig bellami john hartson striker novo secur victori lob dougla eight minut remain end celtic game unbeaten run home old firm derbi give ranger manag alex mcleish first victori home glasgow rival celtic last six meet home pitch includ twice alreadi season start confid new sign bellami loan newcastl unit give celtic debut front wale intern colleagu john hartson chri sutton drop midfield take bellami four minut threaten take marvin andrew deliv low drive held waterreu second attempt even well chanc hartson disposses sotiri kyrgiako sent strike partner clear goalkeep beat waterreu well beat away bellami disappoint low drive yard waterreu come rescu ball fell hartson insid box dutch goalkeep make brave block old firm return barri ferguson mcleish stuck side thump four goal past hibernian ranger found celtic harder break dougla threaten minut break dado prso turn insid neil lennon celtic goalkeep beat away power yard drive great defens header andrew prevent hartson pounc five yard hartson fox vignal edg ranger box striker shot turn beaten away waterreu ranger begin domin midfield vignal collect knock back fernando ricksen broke deadlock dougla somehow let frenchman dip drive slip grasp novo pounc moment hesit celtic defenc latch long ball ricksen lob ball advanc dougla ricksen appear hit coin could prevent ranger celebr final whistl dougla mcnamara bald varga laursen petrov lennon sutton thompson bellami hartson sub marshal henchoz juninho paulista lambert maloney wallac mcgeadi waterreu hutton kyrgiako andrew ball buffel ferguson ricksen vignal prso novo sub mcgregor namouchi burk alex rae malcolm thompson lovenkrand mccurri

327,374,aviator  creator  in oscars snub the man who said he got oscar-nominated movie the aviator off the ground and signed up leonardo dicaprio has been shut out of the academy awards race.  charles evans jr battled over his role with the people who eventually made the film  and won a producer s credit. but he is not on the list of producers who can win a best film oscar due to a limit on the number of nominees. the oscars organisers have picked two of the aviator s four producers to be nominated for best film.  up to three producers can be named per film but the studios behind the aviator and million dollar baby failed to trim their credits - so the academy of motion pictures arts and sciences (ampas) has done it for them. the aviator s nominated producers are michael mann and graham king - with mr evans and sandy climan  mr mann s former deputy  left off. mr evans sued mr mann in 2001  claiming he came up with the idea  spent years developing it and persuaded dicaprio to play hughes - but said he was later excluded from the project. the two sides settled out of court in a deal that has remained secret apart from the fact mr evans  name has appeared as a producer when the film s credits roll. at the golden globes  mr evans - who was named among the winners when the film won best drama film - evaded a security guard to have his photo taken with dicaprio  director martin scorsese  mr mann and mr king.  ampas decided to limit the number of producers who could be nominated after shakespeare in love s victory in 1999 saw five producers collect awards. the eligible names for the aviator and million dollar baby were decided by ampas  producers branch executive committee on wednesday. the decision also saw clint eastwood get his third personal nomination for million dollar baby. he is now named in the best film category as well as being nominated for best director and best lead actor. the academy awards ceremony will be held in hollywood on 27 february. chinese actress ziyi zhang  star of crouching tiger  hidden dragon  hero and house of flying daggers  is the latest name to be added to the list of presenters on the night.,aviat creator oscar snub man say get oscarnomin movi aviat ground sign leonardo dicaprio shut academi award race charl evan jr battl role peopl eventu make film produc credit list produc win best film oscar due limit number nomine oscar organis pick two aviat four produc nomin best film three produc name per film studio behind aviat million dollar babi fail trim credit academi motion pictur art scienc ampa do aviat nomin produc michael mann graham king mr evan sandi climan mr mann former deputi left mr evan su mr mann claim come idea spent year develop persuad dicaprio play hugh say later exclud project two side settl court deal remain secret apart fact mr evan name appear produc film credit roll golden globe mr evan name among winner film best drama film evad secur guard photo take dicaprio director martin scorses mr mann mr king ampa decid limit number produc could nomin shakespear love victori saw five produc collect award elig name aviat million dollar babi decid ampa produc branch execut committe wednesday decis also saw clint eastwood get third person nomin million dollar babi name best film categori well nomin best director best lead actor academi award ceremoni held hollywood februari chine actress ziyi zhang star crouch tiger hidden dragon hero hous fli dagger late name ad list present night

329,1528,pm apology over jailings tony blair has apologised to two families who suffered one of the uk s biggest miscarriages of justice.  the prime minister was commenting on the wrongful jailing of 11 people for ira bomb attacks on pubs in guildford and woolwich in 1974. mr blair said:  i am very sorry that they were subject to such an ordeal and injustice.  he made the apology to members of the conlon and maguire families in his private room at westminster. in a statement recorded for television  mr blair said the families deserved  to be completely and publicly exonerated .  the families had hoped the apology would be made during prime minister s questions in the house of commons. however  one of the so-called guildford four  gerry conlon - who was wrongly convicted of planting the bombs - said the families were delighted with the apology. he said mr blair had spoken with  such sincerity   adding:  he went beyond what we thought he would  he took time to listen to everyone.  you could see he was moved by what people were saying.  tony blair has healed rifts  he is helping to heal wounds. it s a day i never thought would come.  the move followed a huge campaign in ireland for a public apology after eleven people were wrongly convicted of making and planting the ira bombs which killed seven people. mr blair s official spokesman said no-one present at the meeting would  ever forget the strength of feeling of relief that the prime minister s statement brought to them .  most of those convicted were either members or friends of the two families. all were arrested because of a family connection to gerry conlon. mr conlon s father giuseppe was arrested when travelling to london from belfast to help his son. he died while serving his sentence. also arrested were anne maguire and members of her family. mrs maguire was the relative with whom giuseppe planned to stay in london  as well as two family friends. she said it was a  wonderful feeling  to have had the apology and that a weight had been lifted off her shoulders.   the people who were still doubting us should now believe that we were totally innocent   she said. they were all jailed for handling explosives  based on scientific evidence which was later entirely discredited. in october 1989 the court of appeal quashed the sentences of the guildford four  and in june 1991 it overturned the sentences on the maguire seven. mr conlon s case was highlighted in the oscar-nominated film in the name of the father  starring daniel day-lewis.,pm apolog jail toni blair apologis two famili suffer one uk big miscarriag justic prime minist comment wrong jail peopl ira bomb attack pub guildford woolwich mr blair say sorri subject ordeal injustic make apolog member conlon maguir famili privat room westminst statement record televis mr blair say famili deserv complet publicli exoner famili hope apolog would make prime minist question hous common howev one socal guildford four gerri conlon wrongli convict plant bomb say famili delight apolog say mr blair spoken sincer ad go beyond thought would take time listen everyon could see move peopl say toni blair heal rift help heal wound day never thought would come move follow huge campaign ireland public apolog eleven peopl wrongli convict make plant ira bomb kill seven peopl mr blair offici spokesman say noon present meet would ever forget strength feel relief prime minist statement brought convict either member friend two famili arrest famili connect gerri conlon mr conlon father giusepp arrest travel london belfast help son die serv sentenc also arrest ann maguir member famili mr maguir rel giusepp plan stay london well two famili friend say wonder feel apolog weight lift shoulder peopl still doubt u believ total innoc say jail handl explos base scientif evid later entir discredit octob court appeal quash sentenc guildford four june overturn sentenc maguir seven mr conlon case highlight oscarnomin film name father star daniel daylewi

331,890,mobiles rack up 20 years of use mobile phones in the uk are celebrating their 20th anniversary this weekend.  britain s first mobile phone call was made across the vodafone network on 1 january 1985 by veteran comedian ernie wise. in the 20 years since that day  mobile phones have become an integral part of modern life and now almost 90% of britons own a handset. mobiles have become so popular that many people use their handset as their only phone and rarely use a landline.  the first ever call over a portable phone was made in 1973 in new york but it took 10 years for the first commercial mobile service to be launched. the uk was not far behind the rest of the world in setting up networks in 1985 that let people make calls while they walked. the first call was made from st katherine s dock to vodafone s head office in newbury which at the time was over a curry house. for the first nine days of 1985 vodafone was the only firm with a mobile network in the uk. then on 10 january cellnet (now o2) launched its service. mike caudwell  spokesman for vodafone  said that when phones were launched they were the size of a briefcase  cost about £2 000 and had a battery life of little more than 20 minutes.   despite that they were hugely popular in the mid-80s   he said.  they became a yuppy must-have and a status symbol among young wealthy business folk.  this was also despite the fact that the phones used analogue radio signals to communicate which made them very easy to eavesdrop on. he said it took vodafone almost nine years to rack up its first million customers but only 18 months to get the second million.  it s very easy to forget that in 1983 when we put the bid document in we were forecasting that the total market would be two million people   he said.  cellnet was forecasting half that.  now vodafone has 14m customers in the uk alone. cellnet and vodafone were the only mobile phone operators in the uk until 1993 when one2one (now t-mobile) was launched. orange had its uk launch in 1994. both newcomers operated digital mobile networks and now all operators use this technology. the analogue spectrum for the old phones has been retired. called global system for mobiles (gsm) this is now the most widely used phone technology on the planet and is used to help more than 1.2 billion people make calls. mr caudwell said the advent of digital technology also helped to introduce all those things  such as text messaging and roaming that have made mobiles so popular.,mobil rack year use mobil phone uk celebr th anniversari weekend britain first mobil phone call make across vodafon network januari veteran comedian erni wise year sinc day mobil phone becom integr part modern life almost briton handset mobil becom popular mani peopl use handset phone rare use landlin first ever call portabl phone make new york take year first commerci mobil servic launch uk far behind rest world set network let peopl make call walk first call make st katherin dock vodafon head offic newburi time curri hous first nine day vodafon firm mobil network uk januari cellnet o launch servic mike caudwel spokesman vodafon say phone launch size briefcas cost £ batteri life littl minut despit huge popular mid say becam yuppi musthav statu symbol among young wealthi busi folk also despit fact phone use analogu radio signal commun make easi eavesdrop say take vodafon almost nine year rack first million custom month get second million easi forget put bid document forecast total market would two million peopl say cellnet forecast half vodafon m custom uk alon cellnet vodafon mobil phone oper uk oneon tmobil launch orang uk launch newcom oper digit mobil network oper use technolog analogu spectrum old phone retir call global system mobil gsm wide use phone technolog planet use help billion peopl make call mr caudwel say advent digit technolog also help introduc thing text messag roam make mobil popular

336,824,rank  set to sell off film unit  leisure group rank could unveil plans to demerge its film services unit and sell its media business  reports claim.  rank  formerly famous for the carry on series  will expose the shake-up at the announcement of its results on friday  the sunday telegraph reported. advisors goldman sachs are understood to have valued its demerged deluxe film unit at £300m  the report added. speculation of a possible shake-up has mounted since rank announced a study into a possible demerger in september. since mike smith s appointment as chief executive in 1999  the group has focused on fewer businesses and embarked on a major cost-cutting programme which has seen it dispose of a number of businesses  including the odeon cinema chain and the pinewood studios. the move left the group with three core divisions: gaming  hard rock and deluxe films  which provides technical services to hollywood studios.  rank now aims to concentrate on its gaming  bars and hotels business  including extending its hard rock brand to its casinos - trials of which have been a success. it also owns deluxe media  which makes and distributes dvds and videos. however  that business is seen as less successful. last year it made profits of £21.5m on a turnover of £392.1m and experts suggest its success in moving to dvds from vhs video could make it an attractive target for a private equity buyer. a spokesman for the firm refused to comment on the reports  but said any results from the demerger study were likely to be set out when it unveiled its results on friday. analysts predict the firm is likely to report a slight drop in annual pre-tax profits to £170m from £194m last year. formed in the 1940s the firm was a leading uk film producer and cinema owner for many years. it has now diversified into a range of other leisure activities - mainly in the uk - including hotels  roadside service areas and holiday centres. it now owns 34 grosvenor casinos  the mecca bingo chain and more than 100 hard rock cafes in 38 countries.,rank set sell film unit leisur group rank could unveil plan demerg film servic unit sell medium busi report claim rank formerli famou carri seri expo shakeup announc result friday sunday telegraph report advisor goldman sach understood valu demerg delux film unit £m report ad specul possibl shakeup mount sinc rank announc studi possibl demerg septemb sinc mike smith appoint chief execut group focus few busi embark major costcut programm see dispos number busi includ odeon cinema chain pinewood studio move left group three core divis game hard rock delux film provid technic servic hollywood studio rank aim concentr game bar hotel busi includ extend hard rock brand casino trial success also own delux medium make distribut dvd video howev busi see less success last year make profit £m turnov £m expert suggest success move dvd vh video could make attract target privat equiti buyer spokesman firm refus comment report say result demerg studi like set unveil result friday analyst predict firm like report slight drop annual pretax profit £m £m last year form s firm lead uk film produc cinema owner mani year diversifi rang leisur activ mainli uk includ hotel roadsid servic area holiday centr own grosvenor casino mecca bingo chain hard rock cafe countri
337,1412,net fingerprints combat attacks eighty large net service firms have switched on software to spot and stop net attacks automatically.  the system creates digital fingerprints of ongoing incidents that are sent to every network affected. firms involved in the smart sensing system believe it will help trace attacks back to their source. data gathered will be passed to police to help build up intelligence about who is behind worm outbreaks and denial of service attacks.  firms signing up for the sensing system include mci  bt  deutsche telekom  energis  ntt  bell canada and many others. the creation of the fingerprinting system has been brokered by us firm arbor networks and signatures of attacks will be passed to anyone suffering under the weight of an attack. increasingly computer criminals are using swarms of remotely controlled computers to carry out denial of service attacks on websites  launch worms and relay spam around the net.  we have seen attacks involving five and ten gigabytes of traffic   said rob pollard  sales director for arbor networks which is behind the fingerprinting system.  attacks of that size cause collateral damage as they cross the internet before they get to their destination   he said. once an attack is spotted and its signature defined the information will be passed back down the chain of networks affected to help every unwitting player tackle the problem.  mr pollard said arbor was not charging for the service and it would pass on fingerprint data to every network affected.  what we want to do is help net service firms communicate with each other and then push the attacks further and further back around the world to their source   said mr pollard. arbor network s technology works by building up a detailed history of traffic on a network. it spots which computers or groups of users regularly talk to each other and what types of traffic passes between machines or workgroups. any anomaly to this usual pattern is spotted and flagged to network administrators who can take action if the traffic is due to a net-based attack of some kind. this type of close analysis has become very useful as net attacks are increasingly launched using several hundred or thousand different machines. anyone looking at the traffic on a machine by machine basis would be unlikely to spot that they were all part of a concerted attack.  attacks are getting more diffuse and more sophisticated   said malcolm seagrave  security expert at energis.  in the last 12 months it started getting noticeable that criminals were taking to it and we ve seen massive growth.  he said that although informal systems exist to pass on information about attacks  often commercial confidentiality got in the way of sharing enough information to properly combat attacks.,net fingerprint combat attack eighti larg net servic firm switch softwar spot stop net attack automat system creat digit fingerprint ongo incid sent everi network affect firm involv smart sen system believ help trace attack back sourc data gather pas polic help build intellig behind worm outbreak denial servic attack firm sign sen system includ mci bt deutsch telekom energi ntt bell canada mani other creation fingerprint system broker u firm arbor network signatur attack pas anyon suffer weight attack increasingli comput crimin use swarm remot control comput carri denial servic attack websit launch worm relay spam around net see attack involv five ten gigabyt traffic say rob pollard sale director arbor network behind fingerprint system attack size caus collater damag cross internet get destin say attack spot signatur defin inform pas back chain network affect help everi unwit player tackl problem mr pollard say arbor charg servic would pas fingerprint data everi network affect want help net servic firm commun push attack back around world sourc say mr pollard arbor network technolog work build detail histori traffic network spot comput group user regularli talk type traffic pas machin workgroup anomali usual pattern spot flag network administr take action traffic due netbas attack kind type close analysi becom use net attack increasingli launch use sever hundr thousand differ machin anyon look traffic machin machin basi would unlik spot part concert attack attack get diffus sophist say malcolm seagrav secur expert energi last month start get notic crimin take see massiv growth say although inform system exist pas inform attack often commerci confidenti get way share enough inform properli combat attack

339,1763,mps quiz aides over royal income senior officials at the two bodies generating private income for the queen and prince of wales are to be questioned by mps.  aides from the duchy of lancaster and duchy of cornwall will appear before the commons public accounts committee. it has been reported they could be questioned about prince charles  spending on camilla parker bowles. but bbc correspondent peter hunt said they are not responsible for how money is spent and may be unable to answer. duchy officials  who will appear before the committee on monday  are only responsible for generating money. the duchy of lancaster provides the queen s private income  while the duchy of cornwall provides prince charles  annual income. the duchy of cornwall is a 140 000-acre estate across 25 counties  and also includes residential properties  shops  offices  stocks and shares. it was set up in 1337 by king edward iii to provide income for successive heirs to the throne. it covers the cost of the prince s public and private life - neither charles  nor william and harry  receive taxpayers  money from the civil list. however  the prince of wales did receive over £4m from government departments and grants-in-aid in 2003-4. the duchy last year generated almost £12m. the prince has voluntarily paid income tax - currently 40% - since 1993.,mp quiz aid royal incom senior offici two bodi gener privat incom queen princ wale question mp aid duchi lancast duchi cornwal appear common public account committe report could question princ charl spend camilla parker bowl bbc correspond peter hunt say respons money spent may unabl answer duchi offici appear committe monday respons gener money duchi lancast provid queen privat incom duchi cornwal provid princ charl annual incom duchi cornwal acr estat across counti also includ residenti properti shop offic stock share set king edward iii provid incom success heir throne cover cost princ public privat life neither charl william harri receiv taxpay money civil list howev princ wale receiv £m govern depart grantsinaid duchi last year gener almost £m princ voluntarili paid incom tax current sinc
340,787,german jobless rate at new record more than 5.2 million germans were out of work in february  new figures show.  the figure of 5.216 million people  or 12.6% of the working-age population  is the highest jobless rate in europe s biggest economy since the 1930s. the news comes as the head of germany s panel of government economic advisers predicted growth would again stagnate. speaking on german tv  bert ruerup said the panel s earlier forecast of 1.4% was too optimistic and warned growth would be just 1% in 2005.  the german government is trying to tackle the stubbornly-high levels of joblessness with a range of labour market reforms. at their centre is the  hartz-iv  programme introduced in january to shake up welfare benefits and push people back into work - even if some of the jobs are heavily subsidised. the latest unemployment figures look set to increase the pressure on the government. widely leaked to the german newspapers a day in advance  they produced screaming headlines criticising chancellor gerhard schroeder s social democrat-green party administration. mr schroeder had originally come into office promising to halve unemployment.  still  some measures suggest the picture is not quite so bleak. the soaring official unemployment figure follows a change in the methodology which pushed up the jobless rate by more than 500 000 in january. adjusted for seasonal changes  the overall unemployment rate is 4.875 million people or 11.7%  up 0.3 percentage points from the previous month. using the most internationally-accepted methodology of the international labour organisation (ilo)  germany had 3.97 million people out of work in january. and ilo-based figures also suggest that 14 000 new net jobs were created that month  taking the number of people employed to 38.9 million. the ilo defines an unemployed person as someone who in the previous four weeks had actively looked for work they could take up immediately.,german jobless rate new record million german work februari new figur show figur million peopl workingag popul high jobless rate europ big economi sinc s news come head germani panel govern econom advis predict growth would stagnat speak german tv bert ruerup say panel earlier forecast optimist warn growth would german govern tri tackl stubbornlyhigh level jobless rang labour market reform centr hartziv programm introduc januari shake welfar benefit push peopl back work even job heavili subsidis late unemploy figur look set increas pressur govern wide leak german newspap day advanc produc scream headlin criticis chancellor gerhard schroeder social democratgreen parti administr mr schroeder origin come offic promis halv unemploy still measur suggest pictur quit bleak soar offici unemploy figur follow chang methodolog push jobless rate januari adjust season chang overal unemploy rate million peopl percentag point previou month use internationallyaccept methodolog intern labour organis ilo germani million peopl work januari ilobas figur also suggest new net job creat month take number peopl employ million ilo defin unemploy person someon previou four week activ look work could take immedi
341,1755,home phones face unclear future the fixed line phone in your home could soon be an endangered species.  research by handset maker nokia shows that more and more people are using their mobile phone for every call they make or take. according to the study  more than 45 million people in the uk  germany  us and south korea now only use a mobile. it showed that people keep their fixed line phone because call charges are lower  but most of those questioned said the future was definitely mobile.  the nokia-sponsored research showed that mobiles and fixed phones were used for different purposes. home phones were used for longer calls but conversations on mobiles tended to be shorter  between mobiles and to friends. in the uk 69% of those questioned said they turned to their fixed phone because it was still cheaper to use than a mobile. however  when pressed few could say with accuracy how tariffs on fixed and mobile phones compared. in the us and germany many of those interviewed said they used the fixed phone because it was more reliable than a mobile handset and let them get access to the net at relatively high speeds. in all the countries where interviews were carried out  older people were more likely to use a fixed line phone more than a mobile. women aged 50 or above almost never use a mobile phone  the research found.  the move to mobile was most pronounced in south korea where 65% of those questioned said they already make most of their calls from a mobile. 18% said they would not get a landline if they moved house.  many of those questioned said they had an emotional connection to their fixed phone that drew on its position in the home and the  cosiness  of making a call there. nokia said these findings had implications for mobile operators who must work hard to ensure that mobiles are seen as cheap  reliable and providing good call quality. the survey also showed that it is not just voice calls that are going wireless. some of those questioned said they were looking to use a mobile or wireless service to get net access within the next couple of years. polling firm mori interviewed more than 6 000 people in the uk  us  germany and south korea for the survey.,home phone face unclear futur fix line phone home could soon endang speci research handset maker nokia show peopl use mobil phone everi call make take accord studi million peopl uk germani u south korea use mobil show peopl keep fix line phone call charg low question say futur definit mobil nokiasponsor research show mobil fix phone use differ purpos home phone use longer call convers mobil tend shorter mobil friend uk question say turn fix phone still cheaper use mobil howev press could say accuraci tariff fix mobil phone compar u germani mani interview say use fix phone reliabl mobil handset let get access net rel high speed countri interview carri old peopl like use fix line phone mobil woman age almost never use mobil phone research found move mobil pronounc south korea question say alreadi make call mobil say would get landlin move hous mani question say emot connect fix phone drew posit home cosi make call nokia say find implic mobil oper must work hard ensur mobil see cheap reliabl provid good call qualiti survey also show voic call go wireless question say look use mobil wireless servic get net access within next coupl year poll firm mori interview peopl uk u germani south korea survey
342,820,mobile gaming takes off in india gaming on the move is one of the fastest-growing activities among the tech-savvy in india  says a report.  the indian mobile gaming market is expected to generate about $26m (£13.8m) by the end of 2004  according to market analysts in-stat/mdr. in october  mobile phone users grew by 1.4 million to 44.9 million  overtaking the number of landlines  said the telecom regulatory authority of india. analysts say cheap rates and a huge youth market is driving the market. india has a large population of under-25s  and many in urban areas are fast adopting mobiles as must-have gadgets.  india s mobile gaming market will bring in about $336m (£178m) by 2009  according to the report. mobile gaming is expected to explode globally over the next few years. analysts predict that 220 million people will be playing games on phones by 2009  generating billions for mobile companies.  services other than just voice calls which are offered by mobile operators in india have  as a result of the huge rise in subscribers  grown significantly and rapidly.  the growth of this market sector has attracted publishers  developers  animators  musicians  and content providers  and is also stimulating the development of innovative business models   said clint wheelock  director of in-stat/mdr s wireless research group.   mobile gaming is not just about fun; it also represents one key element of a rich mobile entertainment experience for consumers  and a lucrative market opportunity for industry players.  currently  india has six big games developers and four mobile operators that offer games to their subscribers  said the report. according to in-stat/mdr  it is tipped to make up one of the most important markets in the next wave of mobile multimedia growth.  in january 2003  there were only 10 million mobile subscribers in india. many choose mobiles in rural areas in order to bypass poorer telecoms infrastructure. despite this  the penetration rate is still much lower that other countries. less than 20% of india s total population own a mobile in india  compared to well over 50% in most european countries. the trend echoes the uptake of mobiles in many developing economies  which continues to grow as people opt to leapfrog slower and more expensive state-run fixed-line operators.,mobil game take india game move one fastestgrow activ among techsavvi india say report indian mobil game market expect gener m £m end accord market analyst instatmdr octob mobil phone user grow million million overtak number landlin say telecom regulatori author india analyst say cheap rate huge youth market drive market india larg popul under mani urban area fast adopt mobil musthav gadget india mobil game market bring m £m accord report mobil game expect explod global next year analyst predict million peopl play game phone gener billion mobil compani servic voic call offer mobil oper india result huge rise subscrib grown significantli rapidli growth market sector attract publish develop anim musician content provid also stimul develop innov busi model say clint wheelock director instatmdr wireless research group mobil game fun also repres one key element rich mobil entertain experi consum lucr market opportun industri player current india six big game develop four mobil oper offer game subscrib say report accord instatmdr tip make one import market next wave mobil multimedia growth januari million mobil subscrib india mani choos mobil rural area order bypass poorer telecom infrastructur despit penetr rate still much low countri less india total popul mobil india compar well european countri trend echo uptak mobil mani develop economi continu grow peopl opt leapfrog slow expens staterun fixedlin oper
343,1203,what now for british tennis  tim henman s decision to quit davis cup tennis has left the british team with a gargantuan void to fill.  the world number seven is tied for fourth among his countrymen for wins in the history of the tournament (he has 36 from his 50 rubbers). and great britain s last davis cup win without henman came against slovenia as far back as 1996. worse could follow  according to former british team member chris bailey. bailey told bbc sport:  after tim s announcement  i doubt greg rusedski will be that far behind him.  but without their top two  where does that leave british ambitions in the sport s premier team event  captain jeremy bates has singled out alex bogdanovic and andrew murray as potential replacements. the yugoslavian-born bogdanovic  though  is 184 places below henman in the world rankings and has played just two cup ties - winning one and losing the other.  murray  on the other hand  is 407th in the current atp entry list and yet to make his cup debut. but bailey does see some hope for the future. he said:  now we ve dropped down to the euro-africa zone  the time was right for him to step down and let the young guys come to the fore.  britain s next opponents  israel  are hardly likely to be quaking in their boots ahead of the 4-6 march match against a likely trio of bogdanovic  murray and the 187th-ranked arvind parmar. bailey said:  it will be tough for gb to move up  but there comes a time when our young players have to step up. this was always going to be inevitable with tim and greg s growing years.  i m confident about the future. i wouldn t lay money on us getting back into the world group next year  but i d imagine in five years time we ll be competing for the major honours.  of those lining up to replace henman  the 17-year-old murray  with four futures titles under his belt last year  looks the best long-term bet.  murray is the one that looks likeliest to take over tim s mantle   said bailey.  he has an enormous amount of self-confidence  judging by what he s said in the past.  bogdanovic  three years murray s senior  has had a more troubled time under britain s davis cup umbrella.  while murray has been marked out as britain s golden boy  bogdanovic was warned by the lawn tennis association for a lack of drive at the end of 2003. and bailey said:  despite that  alex is clearly talented as well  while arvind is another contender.  they re among the guys who have experienced the intensity of davis cup tennis - whether as players or on the sidelines.  the lta has always done an exceptional job of ensuring that.  now they ll finally get to play regularly in the cauldron of the cup. and i m confident that will springboard team gb to greater success.,british tenni tim henman decis quit davi cup tenni left british team gargantuan void fill world number seven tie fourth among countryman win histori tournament rubber great britain last davi cup win without henman come slovenia far back wors could follow accord former british team member chri bailey bailey told bbc sport tim announc doubt greg rusedski far behind without top two leav british ambit sport premier team event captain jeremi bate singl alex bogdanov andrew murray potenti replac yugoslavianborn bogdanov though place henman world rank play two cup tie win one lose murray hand th current atp entri list yet make cup debut bailey see hope futur say drop euroafrica zone time right step let young guy come fore britain next oppon israel hardli like quak boot ahead march match like trio bogdanov murray thrank arvind parmar bailey say tough gb move come time young player step alway go inevit tim greg grow year confid futur lay money u get back world group next year imagin five year time compet major honour line replac henman yearold murray four futur titl belt last year look best longterm bet murray one look likeliest take tim mantl say bailey enorm amount selfconfid judg say past bogdanov three year murray senior troubl time britain davi cup umbrella murray mark britain golden boy bogdanov warn lawn tenni associ lack drive end bailey say despit alex clearli talent well arvind anoth contend among guy experienc intens davi cup tenni whether player sidelin lta alway do except job ensur final get play regularli cauldron cup confid springboard team gb great success
344,619,search wars hit desktop pcs another front in the on-going battle between microsoft and google is about to be opened.  by the end of 2004 microsoft aims to launch search software to find any kind of file on a pc hard drive. the move is in answer to google s release of its own search tool that catalogues data on desktop pcs. the desktop search market is becoming increasingly crowded as google  aol  yahoo and many smaller firms tout programs that help people find files.  microsoft made the announcement about its forthcoming search software during a call to financial analysts to talk about its first quarter results. john connors  microsoft s chief financial officer said a test version of its desktop search software should be available for download by the end of the year.   we re going to have a heck of a great race in search between google  microsoft and yahoo   he said.  it s going to be really fun to follow.  microsoft is coming late to the desktop search arena and its software will have to compare favourably with programs from a large number of rivals  many of which have fiercely dedicated populations of users. the program could be based on the software microsoft owns as a result of its purchase of lookout software in early october. on 14 october google released desktop search software that catalogues all the files on a pc and lets users use one tool to find e-mail messages  spreadsheets  text files and presentations. the software will also find webpages and messages sent via aol instant messenger.  many other firms have released desktop search systems recently too. companies such as blinkx  copernic  enfish x1 technologies and x-friend all do the same job of cataloguing the huge amounts of information that people increasingly store on their desktop or home computer.  apple has also debuted a similar search system for its computers called spotlight that is due to debut with the release of the tiger operating system. due to follow are net giants aol and yahoo. the latter recently bought stata labs to get its hands on search software that people can use. microsoft is also reputedly working on a novel search system for the next version of windows (codenamed longhorn). however this is not likely to appear until 2006.  the recent activity in the search industry shows that there is a need to move beyond simple keyword-based web search   said kathy rittweger  co-founder of blinkx.  finding information of our own computers is becoming as difficult as it is to find the relevant webpage amongst the billions that exist.   desktop search has become important for several reasons. according to research by message analysts the radicati group up to 45% of the information critical to keeping many businesses running sits in e-mail messages and attachments. jf sullivan  spokesman for e-mail software firm sendmail said many organisations were starting to realise how important messaging was to their organisation and the way the work.  the key thing is being able to manage all this information   he said. also search is increasingly key to the way that people get around the internet. many people use a search engine as the first page they go to when getting on the net. many others use desktop toolbars that let them search for information no matter what other program they are using. having a tool on a desktop can be a lucrative way to control where people go online. for companies such as google which relies on revenue from adverts this knowledge about what people are looking for is worth huge amounts of money. but this invasiveness has already led some to ask about the privacy implications of such tools.,search war hit desktop pc anoth front ongo battl microsoft googl open end microsoft aim launch search softwar find kind file

347,979,february poll claim  speculation  reports that tony blair is planning a snap general election for february 2005 have been described as  idle speculation  by downing street.  a spokesman said he had  no idea  where the reports in the sunday times and sunday telegraph had come from. the papers suggest ministers believe the government could benefit from a  baghdad bounce  following successful iraq elections in january. a british general election was last held in february in 1974. in that election  edward heath lost and failed to build a coalition with the liberals. harold wilson took over and increased his majority later in the year in a second election  the latest speculation suggests the prime minister favours a february poll in order to exploit his current opinion poll lead over conservative leader michael howard. but that strategy could prompt criticism he was seeking to  cut and run  after less then four years of a parliamentary term. the papers report that alan milburn  labour s head of elections strategy  has played a key role in the plan for a february election  which would include a new year advertising blitz. new labour s campaign  both newspapers said  would be centred around the slogan  britain is working . a labour party spokesman said the election date was ultimately a matter for mr blair  but he was unaware of anything to suggest it would be in february. most commentators have been expecting an election on 5 may. the last election was in june 2001.,februari poll claim specul report toni blair plan snap gener elect februari describ idl specul down street spokesman say idea report sunday time sunday telegraph come paper suggest minist believ govern could benefit baghdad bounc follow success iraq elect januari british gener elect last held februari elect edward heath lose fail build coalit liber harold wilson take increas major later year second elect late specul suggest prime minist favour februari poll order exploit current opinion poll lead conserv leader michael howard strategi could prompt critic seek cut run less four year parliamentari term paper report alan milburn labour head elect strategi play key role plan februari elect would includ new year advertis blitz new labour campaign newspap say would centr around slogan britain work labour parti spokesman say elect date ultim matter mr blair unawar anyth suggest would februari comment expect elect may last elect june
348,371,text messages aid disaster recovery text messaging technology was a valuable communication tool in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster in asia.  the messages can get through even when the cell phone signal is too weak to sustain a spoken conversation. now some are studying how the technology behind sms could be better used during an emergency. sanjaya senanayake works for sri lankan television. the blogging world  though  might know him better by his online name  morquendi. he was one of the first on the scene after the tsunami destroyed much of the sri lankan coast. cell phone signals were weak. land lines were unreliable. so mr senanayake started sending out text messages. the messages were not just the latest news they were also an on-the-ground assessment of  who needs what and where . blogging friends in india took mr senanayake s text messages and posted them on a weblog called dogs without borders. thousands around the world followed the story that unfolded in the text messages that he sent.  and that s when mr senanayake started to wonder if sms might be put to more practical use.  sms networks can handle so much more traffic than the standard mobile phone call or the land line call   he says.   in every rural community  there s at least one person who has access to a mobile phone  or has a mobile phone  and can receive messages.  half a world away  in the caribbean nation of trinidad and tobago  taran rampersad read morquendi s messages. mr rampersad  who used to work in the military  knew how important on the ground communication can be in times of disaster. he wondered if there might be a way to automatically centralise text messages  and then redistribute them to agencies and people who might be able to help. mr rampersad said:  imagine if an aid worker in the field spotted a need for water purification tablets  and had a central place to send a text message to that effect.  he can message the server  so the server can send out an e-mail message and human or machine moderators can e-mail aid agencies and get it out in the field.  he added:  or  send it at the same time to other people who are using sms in the region  and they might have an excess of it  and be able to shift supplies to the right places.   mr rampersad and others had actually been thinking about such a system since hurricane ivan ravaged the caribbean and the southern united states last september. last week  he sent out e-mail messages asking for help in creating such a system for asia.  in only 72 hours  he found dan lane  a text message guru living in britain. the pair  along with a group of dedicated techies  are creating what they call the alert retrieval cache. the idea is to use open-source software - software can be used by anyone without commercial restraint - and a far-flung network of talent to create a system that links those in need with those who can help.  this is a classic smart mobs situation where you have people self-organizing into a larger enterprise to do things that benefit other people   says paul saffo  a director at the california-based institute for the future.  you may be halfway around the world from someone  but in cyberspace you re just one click or one e-mail away   he said   that s put a whole new dimension on disaster relief and recovery  where often people halfway around the world can be more effective in making something happen precisely because they re not right on top of the tragedy.  it is still very early days for the project  though. in an e-mail  dan lane calls it  an early proof of concept.  right now  the alert retrieval cache can only take a text message and automatically upload it to a web-page  or distribute it to an e-mail list. in the near future  the group says it hopes to take in messages from people in affected areas  and use human moderators to take actions based on the content of those messages. but there s still another challenge. you have to get people to know that the system is there for them to use.  it s amazing how difficult it is to find someone to pass it along to  and say  look this is what we re trying to do and everything like that   says mr rampersad.  so the big problem right now is the same problem we re trying to solve - human communication.  he is optimistic  however. he thinks that the alert retrieval cache is an idea whose time has come and he hopes governments  too  will sit up and take notice. and he stands by his motto  courtesy of michelangelo: criticise by creating.  clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world  a bbc world service and wgbh-boston co-production.,text messag aid disast recoveri text messag technolog valuabl commun tool aftermath tsunami disast asia messag get even cell phone signal weak sustain spoken convers studi technolog behind sm could well use emerg sanjaya senanayak work sri lankan televis blog world though might know well onlin name morquendi one first scene tsunami destroy much sri lankan coast cell phone signal weak land line unreli mr senanayak start send text messag messag late news also ontheground ass need blog friend india take mr senanayak text messag post weblog call dog without border thousand around world follow stori unfold text messag sent mr senanayak start wonder sm might put practic use sm network handl much traffic standard mobil phone call land line call say everi rural commun least one person access mobil phone mobil phone receiv messag half world away caribbean nation trinidad tobago taran rampersad read morquendi messag mr rampersad use work militari knew import ground commun time disast wonder might way automat centralis text messag redistribut agenc peopl might abl help mr rampersad say imagin aid worker field spot need water purif tablet central place send text messag effect messag server server send email messag human machin moder email aid agenc get field ad send time peopl use sm region might excess abl shift suppli right place mr rampersad other actual think system sinc hurrican ivan ravag caribbean southern unit state last septemb last week sent email messag ask help creat system asia hour found dan lane text messag guru live britain pair along group dedic techi creat call alert retriev cach idea use opensourc softwar softwar use anyon without commerci restraint farflung network talent creat system link need help classic smart mob situat peopl selforgan large enterpris thing benefit peopl say paul saffo director californiabas institut futur may halfway around world someon cyberspac one click one email away say put whole new dimens disast relief recoveri often peopl halfway around world effect make someth happen precis right top tragedi still earli day project though email dan lane call earli proof concept right alert retriev cach take text messag automat upload webpag distribut email list near futur group say hope take messag peopl affect area use human moder take action base content messag still anoth challeng get peopl know system use amaz difficult find someon pas along say look tri everyth like say mr rampersad big problem right problem tri solv human commun optimist howev think alert retriev cach idea whose time come hope govern sit take notic stand motto courtesi michelangelo criticis creat clark boyd technolog correspond world bbc world servic wgbhboston coproduct

350,777,talks aim to avert pension strike talks aimed at averting a series of national strikes over pensions reforms will take place this weekend.  five public sector unions will hold private talks with deputy prime minister john prescott at labour s spring conference in gateshead. they want the government to withdraw regulations - due to be introduced in weeks - which would raise the pension age for council workers from 60 to 65. up to 1.4m workers could take part in a strike already earmarked for 23 march. however  all sides are anxious to avoid a major confrontation in the run up to the general election  said bbc labour affairs correspondent stephen cape. in four days  britain s biggest union unison will start balloting 800 000 local government workers on strikes. other public sector unions have pledged to follow. it is just weeks before new regulations are introduced to raise the pension age of local government workers.  the five unions meeting mr prescott want the government to withdraw these regulations. this would allow months of tough negotiations to follow  said our correspondent. but a spokesman for mr prescott warned that the changes to the local government pension scheme would have to go ahead in april. privately ministers believe this will be the  less painful  option  our correspondent added. the public and commercial services union (pcs) will co-ordinate any industrial action with up to six other public sector unions. pcs leader mark serwotka warned last week that there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink.  for a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service  choice on this and choice on that - isn t it ironic that they re saying to public sector workers there is no choice   he said.  if you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years - that is working until people drop.  in the 20th century  it s completely unacceptable.   unison s 800 000 workers  the transport and general workers  union s 70 000 and amicus  20 000 are among those being balloted about a 23 march walkout. mr prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures last week. it is understood no deal was offered in that meeting but there was room for further negotiations.,talk aim avert pension strike talk aim avert seri nation strike pension reform take place weekend five public sector union hold privat talk deputi prime minist john prescott labour spring confer gateshead want govern withdraw regul due introduc week would rais pension age council worker m worker could take part strike alreadi earmark march howev side anxiou avoid major confront run gener elect say bbc labour affair correspond stephen cape four day britain big union unison start ballot local govern worker strike public sector union pledg follow week new regul introduc rais pension age local govern worker five union meet mr prescott want govern withdraw regul would allow month tough negoti follow say correspond spokesman mr prescott warn chang local govern pension scheme would go ahead april privat minist believ less pain option correspond ad public commerci servic union pc coordin industri action six public sector union pc leader mark serwotka warn last week could walkout unless govern rethink govern lectur everyon choic choic public servic choic choic iron say public sector worker choic say want pension promis start must work extra five year work peopl drop th centuri complet unaccept unison worker transport gener worker union amicu among ballot march walkout mr prescott held privat meet senior union figur last week understood deal offer meet room negoti
351,470,howard attacks cost of asylum michael howard has launched an attack on the cost of britain s  chaotic  asylum system under tony blair.  the tory leader said english local authorities have spent more than £3bn - or £140 per household - on asylum since labour won power in 1997. mr howard is expected to tell activists in kent that voters  tolerance and desire to help others are being abused. other parties and refugee agencies have already attacked tory plans for annual limits on numbers.  mr howard said britain should take its fair share of the world s  genuine refugees .   the anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz - where my grandmother was murdered along with over a million others - has reminded all of us that we have a moral responsibility to those fleeing persecution   he was due to say.  but if we are to fulfil responsibility  we have to get a grip of the system.  fair play matters. people want a government that upholds the rules - not one that turns a blind eye when they are bent and abused   he said.  and let s be clear. our asylum system is being abused - and with it britain s generosity.  earlier this week  mr howard said his party s plans to cut immigration were not racist  arguing they would make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees. if elected  his party would institute an annual limit on asylum and all claims would be processed overseas.  that prompted some charities to say the plans would put refugees  lives at risk if they were turned away once quotas were filled.  if we have a moral responsibility towards people fleeing persecution  then these policies will not provide a safe haven   said hannah ward of the refugee council.  if people turn up in the uk asking for help they will be turned away. michael howard s policy effectively means there is no safe haven in the uk.  when it comes to costs  then perhaps we should start with how decisions are made on asylum seekers. so many of them are shown to be wrong - one in five decisions that are appealed are successfully overturned  rising to half for some nationalities.  we need good quality decision-making on asylum applications because it is delays in the system which cost so much.   tony blair said labour would set out workable plans for tackling immigration abuse in the next few weeks and attacked the tory plans.  by cutting the number of front-line immigration staff at our borders  they will actually make the problem worse   said mr blair. liberal democrat chairman matthew taylor said there needed to be a quick  fair and firm asylum system. but he said it was  absolutely disgusting  to propose a system which could turn away genuine refugees. the conservatives say there is little risk of this happening as demand for asylum will be considered when quotas are set. on monday  mr howard said:  it s not racist  as some people to claim  to talk about controlling immigration far from it.,howard attack cost asylum michael howard launch attack cost britain chaotic asylum system toni blair torus leader say english local author spent £bn £ per household asylum sinc labour power mr howard expect tell activist kent voter toler desir help other abus parti refuge agenc alreadi attack torus plan annual limit number mr howard say britain take fair share world genuin refuge anniversari liber auschwitz grandmoth murder along million other remind u moral respons flee persecut due say fulfil respons get grip system fair play matter peopl want govern uphold rule one turn blind eye bent abus say let clear asylum system abus britain generos earlier week mr howard say parti plan cut immigr racist argu would make asylum system fairer genuin refuge elect parti would institut annual limit asylum claim would process oversea prompt chariti say plan would put refuge live risk turn away quota fill moral respons toward peopl flee persecut polici provid safe say hannah ward refuge council peopl turn uk ask help turn away michael howard polici effect mean safe uk come cost perhap start decis make asylum seeker mani show wrong one five decis appeal success overturn rise half nation need good qualiti decisionmak asylum applic delay system cost much toni blair say labour would set workabl plan tackl immigr abus next week attack torus plan cut number frontlin immigr staff border actual make problem wors say mr blair liber democrat chairman matthew taylor say need quick fair firm asylum system say absolut disgust propos system could turn away genuin refuge conserv say littl risk happen demand asylum consid quota set monday mr howard say racist peopl claim talk control immigr far
352,1156,bid to cut court witness stress new targets to reduce the stress to victims and witnesses giving evidence in courts in england and wales have been announced by the lord chancellor.  lord falconer wants all crown courts and 90% of magistrates  courts to have facilities to keep witnesses separate from defendants within four years. more video links will also be made available so that witnesses do not have to enter courtrooms. it is part of a five-year plan to help build confidence in the justice system.  ministers say the strategy is aimed at re-balancing the court system towards victims  and increasing the number of offenders brought to justice. launching the department for constitutional affairs  plan  lord falconer said:  one of the top priorities will be a better deal for victims.  the needs and safety of victims will be at the heart of the way trials are managed.   courts  judges  magistrates  prosecutors  police and victim support - all working together to ensure the rights of victims are put first  without compromising the rights of the defendant.  he went on:  giving evidence is a nerve-wracking experience  especially when you re a victim.  yet with a will and with support it can be done.  lord falconer told bbc radio 4 s today programme it was impossible for some elderly people to go to court to give evidence. other witnesses could be intimidated by sitting alongside defendants outside courts.  you are never going to get rid of some element of the trauma of giving evidence   he said.  but you can make people believe that the courts understand the problem  it s not some kind of alien place where they go where they are not thinking about them.   the plan comes as the lord chancellor also considers allowing cameras into courts for the first time since 1925  as long as they were used for cases that did not involve witnesses. another feature of the strategy is constitutional reform  with a government bill to set up a supreme court and a judicial appointments commission returning to the house of lords on tuesday. ministers had proposed getting rid of the title of lord chancellor  but the lords have over-ruled this. lord falconer said it was right for the highest court to be completely distinct from parliament. the person in charge of the court system should not also be speaker of the house of lords  he said  and should be the best person chosen from either house of parliament. what they did  not what they were called  was the critical issue  he added.,bid cut court wit stress new target reduc stress victim wit give evid court england wale announc lord chancellor lord falcon want crown court magistr court facil keep wit separ defend within four year video link also make avail wit enter courtroom part fiveyear plan help build confid justic system minist say strategi aim rebalanc court system toward victim increas number offend brought justic launch depart constitut affair plan lord falcon say one top prioriti well deal victim need safeti victim heart way trial manag court judg magistr prosecutor polic victim support work togeth ensur right victim put first without compromis right defend go give evid nervewrack experi especi victim yet support do lord falcon told bbc radio today programm imposs elderli peopl go court give evid wit could intimid sit alongsid defend outsid court never go get rid element trauma give evid say make peopl believ court understand problem kind alien place go think plan come lord chancellor also consid allow camera court first time sinc long use case involv wit anoth featur strategi constitut reform govern bill set suprem court judici appoint commiss return hous lord tuesday minist propos get rid titl lord chancellor lord overrul lord falcon say right high court complet distinct parliament person charg court system also speaker hous lord say best person chosen either hous parliament call critic issu ad

356,1121,blair congratulates bush on win tony blair has said he looks forward to continuing his strong relationship with george bush and working with him during his second term as president.  mr bush s re-election came at a crucial time for a world that was  fractured  divided and uncertain   mr blair said. it had to be brought together  he added  saying action was needed on poverty  the middle east and the conditions on which terrorists prey. mr blair said states had to work with the us to fight global terrorism.  but there was a need to recognise it would not be defeated by  military might alone but also by demonstrating the strength of our common values  he added. solving the conflict in the middle east was the world s single most  pressing political challenge  of the present day  mr blair warned. the prime minister also urged europe and the us to  build anew their alliance .   all of us in positions of leadership  not just president bush  have a responsibility to rise to this challenge. it is urgent that we do so.  mr blair also paid tribute to democrat john kerry s campaign  saying he had helped make the presidential election  a true celebration of american democracy . the election of the us president was significant for the world but particularly so for britain because of its special relationship  he added. earlier tory leader michael howard sent mr bush his  warmest congratulations   saying:  we look to the president to be a unifying force for those all over the world who share our determination to defend freedom.  liberal democrat leader charles kennedy welcomed the fact there had been a quick conclusion to the election  unlike in 2000.  mr bush s first task was to  rebuild a sense of domestic purpose  within the us  he said. mr kennedy said:  internationally  it is to be hoped that a second term will see a more sensitive approach to relations with long-standing allies  not least for the global efforts to combat terrorism.  lib dem foreign affairs spokesman menzies campbell said a win by mr kerry would have given mr blair the chance of a fresh start  adding it was almost as if there was an  umbilical cord  between mr bush and the uk premier.   europeans must hope that his administration will be much more multilateral in character  and that he will act swiftly to rebuild the atlantic partnership which is so vital to security.  iraq will remain an issue of potential division for some time to come.  even before the result became clear  mr blair was being urged to push for action on climate change at his first meeting with whichever candidate won.  liberal democrat environment spokesman norman baker underlined the issue of global warming during a commons debate on anglo-american relations on wednesday. environment secretary margaret beckett has said the us will act on global warming despite george bush s refusal to sign up to the kyoto protocol on carbon emissions. public opinion would force change  she told bbc news. but myron ebell  an adviser on climate change to president bush  has said there would be no change in the us stance and rejected the threat of climate change. he claimed the us was the only

360,603,pension hitch for long-living men male life expectancy is much higher than originally estimated  leading pension researchers have said.  the pensions policy institute (ppi) said life expectancy for unskilled and professional men has been understated. life expectancy at birth is 71 years for a manual worker and 79 years for a professional - a gap of eight years. but if measured at age 65 instead  the ppi said  a manual worker will live to 81 years and a professional worker to 86 years - a gap of just five years. the ppi s estimate is higher because it excludes people who have died before they reach 65 years of age and also takes into account ongoing improvements in life expectancy.  the government has ruled out raising the state pension age  because it says it would penalise lower-skilled workers who generally have lower life expectancies. chris curry  ppi research director  said its calculations suggested there could be more pressure on state pension spending than originally envisaged.  even people in social class v [unskilled manual workers] who are widely likely to have the lowest life expectancy can still expect to live 16 years after state pension age   he said. researchers have not updated life expectancy projections for women  who on average live longer than men.,pension hitch longliv men male life expect much high origin estim lead pension research say pension polici institut ppi say life expect unskil profession men underst life expect birth year manual worker year profession gap eight year measur age instead ppi say manual worker live year profession worker year gap five year ppi estim high exclud peopl die reach year age also take account ongo improv life expect govern rule rais state pension age say would penalis lowerskil worker gener low life expect chri curri ppi research director say calcul suggest could pressur state pension spend origin envisag even peopl social class v unskil manual worker wide like low life expect still expect live year state pension age say research updat life expect project woman averag live longer men
361,2064,campbell rescues arsenal sol campbell proved to be an unlikely match-winner to earn arsenal a hard-fought win at portsmouth.  the england defender lashed home a 25-yard shot for his first goal in 16 months to take arsenal back into second spot  five points behind chelsea. but before campbell scored the best two chances of the game fell to pompey striker ricardo fuller. in the first half he blasted wide when clear  and his control let him down in the second half when well placed. portsmouth got plenty of bodies behind the ball to deny arsenal space in the early stages. but their marking was slack at a corner and patrick vieira should have done better when the ball fell to him 16 yards out. a mistake by arjan de zeeuw let thierry henry in behind the pompey defence on 17 minutes but as he bore down on goal linvoy primus got in a saving tackle. with just fuller as an out-and-out striker  portsmouth s shape made life difficult for arsenal. but a delightful touch by robin van persie gave henry a sight of goal  although the angle was too tight for his shot to trouble jamie ashdown.  ashdown caused hearts to flutter on 28 minutes when he missed his punch at a corner and kolo toure headed just wide and  as arsenal began to press  van persie blasted over a good opportunity after henry had set him up. henry took a quick return pass from vieira but ashdown was out quickly to block  and there were some anxious seconds for pompey as the ball ran loose before matthew taylor cleared. after playing second fiddle  portsmouth should have taken the lead on 34 minutes. referee howard webb played a good advantage to allow steve stone to send gary o neil away but  having shrugged off toure  the pompey midfielder planted his shot wide from 10 yards. as half-time approached  henry teased a shot through a ruck of players and inches wide. at the other end  fuller broke clear but failed to hit the target as toure closed him down.  fuller was given the best chance of the match so far on 48 minutes when patrik berger s break and slipped pass played him clear. but a poor first touch lost him the opportunity and even when he checked back and went down under vieira s challenge  referee webb was not interested. fuller paid the price when he gave way on 55 minutes to aiyegbeni yakubu  who returned after six weeks out with a knee injury. but it needed alert reflexes and safe handling from ashdown to cling on to van persie s shot as henry sniffed for scraps.  portsmouth were growing in confidence and keeper manuel almunia had to stand his ground to beat away a powerful shot from berger. arsenal were struggling to find their rhythm but took the lead through the unlikely source of campbell. the england defender needed little invitation as pompey backed off to stride forward and lash a ferocious shot past ashdown. arsenal might have stretched their lead two minutes later when mathieu flamini escaped his marker to flash a header wide from henry s free-kick. almunia went full length to grab berger s long-range shot  while ashdown palmed away substitute dennis bergkamp s shot.  ashdown  griffin  de zeeuw  primus  taylor  stone  o neil  faye

365,892,councils  must find gypsy sites  ministers are telling councils to find more sites for travellers  amid continuing rows concerning a string of unauthorised encampments.  councils are also to be given stronger powers to move on illegal settlements by gypsy communities on rural land. more money is to be given to councils to develop official caravan parks  said housing minister yvette cooper. in november  mps urged ministers to make councils create sites because 3 500 travellers have no place to stop. ms cooper said an annual scheme to refurbish existing traveller sites would now be extended to consider council bids for new stopping places. that scheme has paid out £25m in four years  with £8m available for 2005.   there are two major problems in the planning system at the moment concerning gypsy and traveller sites   said ms cooper.  firstly  local authorities are not identifying enough appropriate locations either for private or public sites. and secondly  they do not have enough powers to deal swiftly with development on inappropriate sites.  the result is that there are too many developments on inappropriate sites  causing tensions and difficulties for both the neighbouring communities and the gypsies and travellers.  that is why we are consulting on a new obligation on local authorities to identify more appropriate sites  as well as new powers to take immediate action if the development is in the wrong place and cannot be tolerated in even the short-term because of risk to local amenity and the environment.  under the new regulations  expected to be in force in the spring  officials will be able to serve  temporary stop notices  aimed at preventing works on a site before a council has had chance to obtain a full legal ban. many mps with rural constituencies  particularly in eastern england  have been pressing the government to create stronger enforcement powers  saying villagers are suffering because of the legal delays in removing illegal encampments.  andrew ryder  of the traveller law reform coalition  said:  we welcome talk about an obligation on councils to identify land for gypsies and travellers  so long as it is a real obligation as opposed to a recommendation which could be and was easily ignored.  new accommodation proposals for travellers need to be backed up with decent funding and intervention by the government when councils attempt to dodge their responsibilities towards travellers  as they often do.  living on the side of the road or being worn down by planning appeals  legal action and eviction is no one s idea of fun.  in their november report  mps from the committee scrutinising the office for the deputy prime minister  responsible for housing  said most illegal traveller encampments were caused by a lack of places to stop. numerous communities and councils were paying for lengthy and expensive evictions against travelling communities  said the mps. in turn  the problems had worsened because councils were reluctant to voluntarily provide sites because of resistance from residents. two of the most controversial traveller sites - cottenham in cambridgeshire and minety in wiltshire - remain embroiled in an ongoing legal battle.,council must find gypsi site minist tell council find site travel amid continu row concern string unauthoris encamp council also give strong power move illeg settlement gypsi commun rural land money give council develop offici caravan park say hous minist yvett cooper novemb mp urg minist make council creat site travel place stop m cooper say annual scheme refurbish exist travel site would extend consid council bid new stop place scheme paid £m four year £m avail two major problem plan system moment concern gypsi travel site say m cooper firstli local author identifi enough appropri locat either privat public site secondli enough power deal swiftli develop inappropri site result mani develop inappropri site caus tension difficulti neighbour commun gypsi travel consult new oblig local author identifi appropri site well new power take immedi action develop wrong place toler even shortterm risk local amen environ new regul expect forc spring offici abl serv temporari stop notic aim prevent work site council chanc obtain full legal ban mani mp rural constitu particularli eastern england press govern creat strong enforc power say villag suffer legal delay remov illeg encamp andrew ryder travel law reform coalit say welcom talk oblig council identifi land gypsi travel long real oblig oppos recommend could easili ignor new accommod propos travel need back decent fund intervent govern council attempt dodg respons toward travel often live side road worn plan appeal legal action evict one idea fun novemb report mp committe scrutinis offic deputi prime minist respons hous say illeg travel encamp caus lack place stop numer commun council pay lengthi expens evict travel commun say mp turn problem worsen council reluct voluntarili provid site resist resid two controversi travel site cottenham cambridgeshir mineti wiltshir remain embroil ongo legal battl

367,436,mac mini heralds mini revolution the mac mini was launched amid much fanfare by apple and great excitement by apple watchers last month. but does the latest macintosh justify the hype  let us get a few things dealt with at the outset - yes  the mac mini is really  really small  and yes  it is another piece of inspired apple design. there is more to be said on the computer s size and design but it is worth highlighting that the mac mini is a just a computer. inside that small box there is a g4 processor  a cd/dvd player  a hard drive  some other technical bits and bobs and an operating system. a dvd burner  wireless and bluetooth technologies can be bought at extra cost. and if you do not have a monitor  keyboard or mouse then you will need to purchase those also.  it is not the fastest computer for the money but for under £400 you are getting something more interesting than mere technical specifications - apple software. the mac mini comes bundled with mac os x  the operating system  as well as ilife 05  a suite of software which includes itunes  web browser safari  iphoto  garage band and idvd. i doubt many pc lovers would seriously argue that windows xp comes with a better suite of programs than mac os x.  of course  users of open source operating system linux draw up their own menu of programs. for people who want to do interesting things with their music  photos and home movies then a mac mini is an ideal first computer or companion to a main computer.  it s a good little machine with a reasonable amount of power and just perfect for the average computer user who wants to leave the tyranny of window and viruses   said mark sparrow  technical and reviews editor at mac format magazine. he added:  in essence  it s a laptop in a biscuit tin  minus the screen and the keyboard.  the software bundle that comes with the mini makes your average budget pc look a bit sick.  the relatively low price of the machine has also encouraged the more technically-savvy to experiment with their macs. one user has already created a  dock  to enable him to plug in and out his mac mini in his car.  the small size of the machine makes it a practical solution for in-car entertainment - playing movies and music - as well as navigation. another user has mounted his mac mini to the back of his large plasma screen and then controls the computer via a wireless keyboard and mouse. when it was first announced some pundits thought the mini was designed as a sort of stealth media centre - ie the machine would be used to serve tv programmes  music  films and photos - partly due to its small  living room friendly design. but there are obvious reasons why this is not the case - at least not in the here and now the hard drive - at 80gb for the larger model - is too small to be realistically used as media centre.  while commercial personal video recorders are on the market with smaller than 80gb hard drives it is worth remembering that they only store tv content. a media centre computer has to store music  files and photos and as such 80gb just seems too small. most pcs running windows media center have at least 120gb hard disks. coupled with the lack of a tv tuner card  a digital audio out and any kind of media centre software bundled with the machine then the mac mini should be judged on what it is  not what it is not. but that has not stopped more enterprising users from adapting the mac mini to media centre uses. so - is the mac mini just another computer or a revolution in computing  graham barlow  editor of mac format  understandably has a rather partisan viewpoint.  it s just a mac  but we should be very excited - it s revolutionary in its size (smaller than pcs)  looks (looks better than pcs)  and the fact that it s the first mac designed to really go for the low-cost pc market.  the design of the mac mini is further evidence of a future when pcs are more than just bland  bulky boxes. there are a number of companies who already produce miniature pcs based on mini-itx motherboards. but at the moment these pcs tend to be either for the home-build enthusiast or expensive pre-built options based around microsoft s media center software. but for the value the mac mini offers  bringing some of the best software packages within reach of more consumers than ever before  apple is to be congratulated. let us say then that if the mac mini is not a fully fledged revolution -

370,435,s korean lender faces liquidation creditors of south korea s top credit card firm have said they will put the company into liquidation if its ex-parent firm fails to back a bail-out.  lg card s creditors have given lg group until wednesday to sign up to a $1.1bn rescue package. the firm avoided bankruptcy thanks to a $4.5bn bail-out in january 2004  which gave control to the creditors. lg group has said any package should reflect the firm s new ownership  and it will not accept an unfair burden. at least seven million people in south korea use lg card s plastic for purchases.  lg card s creditors have threatened parent group lg group with penalties if it fails to respond to their demands.   creditors would seek strong financial sanctions against lg group if lg card is liquidated   said yoo ji-chang  governor of korean development bank (kdb) - one of the card firm s major creditors. lg group has said providing further help to the credit card issuer could hurt its corporate credibility and could spark shareholder lawsuits. it says it wants  fair and reasonable guidelines  on splitting the financial burden with the creditors  who now own 99.3% of lg card. the creditors have asked the government to mediate to avoid any risk to the stability of financial markets  kdb said. analysts believe a compromise is likely.  lg group knows the impact on consumer demand and the national economy from a liquidation of lg card   said kim yungmin  an equity strategist at dongwon investment trust management.  lg card almost collapsed in 2003 due to an increase in overdue credit card bills after the bursting of a credit bubble. the firm returned to profit in september 2004  but now needs a capital injection to avoid being delisted from the korea stock exchange. the exchange can delist a company if its debt exceeds its assets for two years running. lg card s creditors fear that such a move would triggered massive debt redemption requests that could bankrupt the firm  which owes about $12.05bn.  eventually  lg group will have to participate  but they have been stalling to try to earn better concessions   said mr kim.,korean lender face liquid creditor south korea top credit card firm say put compani liquid expar firm fail back bailout lg card creditor give lg group wednesday sign bn rescu packag firm avoid bankruptci thank bn bailout januari give control creditor lg group say packag reflect firm new ownership accept unfair burden least seven million peopl south korea use lg card plastic purchas lg card creditor threaten parent group lg group penalti fail respond demand creditor would seek strong financi sanction lg group lg card liquid say yoo jichang governor korean develop bank kdb one card firm major creditor lg group say provid help credit card issuer could hurt corpor credibl could spark sharehold lawsuit say want fair reason guidelin split financi burden creditor lg card creditor ask govern mediat avoid risk stabil financi market kdb say analyst believ compromis like lg group know impact consum demand nation economi liquid lg card say kim yungmin equiti strategist dongwon invest trust manag lg card almost collaps due increas overdu credit card bill burst credit bubbl firm return profit septemb need capit inject avoid delist korea stock exchang exchang delist compani debt exce asset two year run lg card creditor fear move would trigger massiv debt redempt request could bankrupt firm owe bn eventu lg group particip stall tri earn well concess say mr kim

375,1811,yukos unit fetches $9bn at auction a little-known russian company has bought the main production unit of oil giant yukos at auction in moscow.  baikal finance group outbid favourite gazprom  the state-controlled gas monopoly  to buy yuganskneftegas. baikal paid 260.75bn roubles ($9.37bn: £4.8bn) for yugansk - nowhere near the $27bn russia says yukos owes in taxes. yukos reacted immediately by repeating its view that the auction was illegal in international and russian law  and said baikal had bought itself trouble.   the company considers that the victor of today s auction has bought itself a serious $9bn headache   said yukos spokesman alexander shadrin. he said the company would continue to make  every lawful move  to protect tens of thousands of shareholders in yukos from  this forcible and illegitimate removal of their property . meanwhile  tim osborne  head of yukos main shareholders  group menatep  said that yukos may have to declare itself bankrupt  and that legal action would be taken  outside russia  against the auction winners. reports from russia say baikal has paid a deposit of nearly $1.7bn from a sberbank (savings bank) account to the russian federal property fund  for yugansk.  the sale came despite a restraining order issued by a us court dealing with the firm s bankruptcy application for chapter 11 protection. yukos has always insisted the auction was state-sponsored theft but russian authorities argued they were imposing the law  trying to recover billions in unpaid taxes. there were originally four registered bidders  and with its close ties to the kremlin  state-backed gas monopoly gazprom had been seen as favourite. but just two companies turned up for the auction  gazprom and the unknown baikal finance group  named after a large freshwater lake in siberia. and  according to tass news agency  gazprom did not make a single bid  leaving the way open for baikal  which paid above the auction start price of 246.75bn roubles.  mystery firm baikal finance group is officially registered in the central russian region of tver  but many analysts believe it may be linked to gazprom. kaha kiknavelidze  analyst at troika dialog  said:  i think a decision that yugansk should end up with gazprom was taken a long time ago. so the main question was how to structure this transaction.   i would not exclude that the structure of the deal has slightly changed and gazprom now has a partner.  i would also not exclude that baikal will decline to pay in 14 days  that are given by law  and gazprom is then recognised as the winner. this would give gazprom an extra 14 days to accumulate the needed funds.  another surprise was that the winner paid a significant premium above the starting price.  however  gazprom has announced it is not linked to baikal in any way. and paul collison  chief analyst at brunswick ubs  said:  i see no plausible explanation for the theory that baikal was representing competing interests.  yugansk will most likely end up with gazprom but could still end up with the government. there is still potential for surprises.  yugansk is at the heart of yukos - pumping close to a million barrels of oil a day. the unit was seized by the government which claims the oil giant owes more than $27bn in taxes and fines. yukos says those tax demands are exorbitant  and had sought refuge in us courts.  the us bankruptcy court s initial order on thursday - to temporarily block the sale - in response to yukos filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection  was upheld in a second ruling on saturday. the protection  if recognised by the russian authorities  would have allowed yukos  current management to retain control of the business and block the sale of any company assets. yukos has said the sale amounts to expropriation - punishment for the political ambitions of its founder  mikhail khodorkovsky. mr khodorkovsky is now in jail  on separate fraud charges. but president vladimir putin has described the affair as a crackdown on corruption - and the bbc s sarah rainsford in moscow says most russians believe the destruction of yukos is now inevitable. hours before the auction lawyers for menatep  a group through which mr khodorkovsky and his associates control yukos  said they would take legal action in other countries. menatep lawyers  who were excluded from observing the auction  said they would retaliate by seeking injunctions in foreign courts to impound russian oil and gas exports.,yuko unit fetch bn auction littleknown russian compani bought main product unit oil giant yuko auction moscow baikal financ group outbid favourit gazprom statecontrol ga monopoli buy yuganskneftega baikal paid bn roubl bn £bn yugansk nowher near bn russia say yuko owe tax yuko react immedi repeat view auction illeg intern russian law say baikal bought troubl compani consid victor today auction bought seriou bn headach say yuko spokesman alexand shadrin say compani would continu make everi law move protect ten thousand sharehold yuko forcibl illegitim remov properti meanwhil tim osborn head yuko main sharehold group menatep say yuko may declar bankrupt legal action would take outsid russia auction winner report russia say baikal paid deposit nearli bn sberbank save bank account russian feder properti fund yugansk sale come despit restrain order issu u court deal firm bankruptci applic chapter protect yuko alway insist auction statesponsor theft russian author argu impos law tri recov billion unpaid tax origin four regist bidder close tie kremlin stateback ga monopoli gazprom see favourit two compani turn auction gazprom unknown baikal financ group name larg freshwat lake siberia accord ta news agenc gazprom make singl bid leav way open baikal paid auction start price bn roubl mysteri firm baikal financ group offici regist central russian region tver mani analyst believ may link gazprom kaha kiknavelidz analyst troika dialog say think decis yugansk end gazprom take long time ago main question structur transact would exclud structur deal slightli chang gazprom partner would also exclud baikal declin pay day give law gazprom recognis winner would give gazprom extra day accumul need fund anoth surpris winner paid signific premium start price howev gazprom announc link baikal way paul collison chief analyst brunswick ub say see plausibl explan theori baikal repres compet interest yugansk like end gazprom could still end govern still potenti surpris yugansk heart yuko pump close million barrel oil day unit seiz govern claim oil giant owe bn tax fine yuko say tax demand exorbit sought refug u court u bankruptci court initi order thursday temporarili block sale respons yuko file chapter bankruptci protect upheld second rule saturday protect recognis russian author would allow yuko current manag retain control busi block sale compani asset yuko say sale amount expropri punish polit ambit founder mikhail khodorkovski mr khodorkovski jail separ fraud charg presid vladimir putin describ affair crackdown corrupt bbc sarah rainsford moscow say russian believ destruct yuko inevit hour auction lawyer menatep group mr khodorkovski associ control yuko say would take legal action countri menatep lawyer exclud observ auction say would retali seek injunct foreign court impound russian oil ga export

378,682,winter freeze keeps oil above $50 oil prices carried on rising on wednesday after cold weather on both sides of the north atlantic pushed us crude prices to four-month highs.  freezing temperatures and heavy snowfalls took crude oil prices past $50 a barrel on tuesday for the first time since november. declines in the dollar have also contributed to the rising oil price. us crude was trading at $51.39 at 0710 gmt in asian electronic trade on wednesday. a barrel of us crude oil closed up $2.80 at $51.15 in new york on tuesday. opec members said on tuesday that  given such high prices  the cartel saw no reason to cut its output.  although below last year s peak of $55.67 a barrel  which was reached in october  prices are now well above 2004 s average of $41.48. brent crude also rose in london trading  adding $1.89 to $48.62 at the close.  much of western europe and the north east of america has been shivering under unseasonably low temperatures in recent days. the decline in the us dollar to a five-week low against the euro has also served to inflate prices.  the primary factor is the weak dollar   said victor shum  a singapore-based analyst with purvin and gertz. expectations that a rebound in the dollar would halt the oil price rise were not immediately borne out on wednesday morning  as oil prices carried on upwards as the dollar strengthened against the euro  the pound and the yen.  several opec members said on tuesday that a cut in production was unlikely  citing rising prices and strong demand for oil from asia.  i agree that we do not need to cut supply if the prices are as much as this   fathi bin shatwan  libya s oil minister  told reuters.  i do not think we need to cut unless the prices are falling below $35 a barrel   he added.,winter freez keep oil oil price carri rise wednesday cold weather side north atlant push u crude price fourmonth high freez temperatur heavi snowfal take crude oil price past barrel tuesday first time sinc novemb declin dollar also contribut rise oil price u crude trade gmt asian electron trade wednesday barrel u crude oil close new york tuesday opec member say tuesday give high price cartel saw reason cut output although last year peak barrel reach octob price well averag brent crude also rise london trade ad close much western europ north east america shiver unseason low temperatur recent day declin u dollar fiveweek low euro also serv inflat price primari factor weak dollar say victor shum singaporebas analyst purvin gertz expect rebound dollar would halt oil price rise immedi born wednesday morn oil price carri upward dollar strengthen euro pound yen sever opec member say tuesday cut product unlik cite rise price strong demand oil asia agre need cut suppli price much fathi bin shatwan libya oil minist told reuter think need cut unless price fall barrel ad

380,797,uk broadband gets speed injection broadband s rapid rise continues apace as speeds gear up a notch.  an eight megabit service has been launched by internet service provider uk online. it is 16 times faster than the average broadband package on the market and will pave the way for services such as video-on-demand and broadband tv. the service is possible due to a new regime which allows other operators to use bt s exchanges and will initially only be available in towns.  it represents a  big leap forward  for broadband  said chris stening  uk online general manager.  the service comes with a hefty £39.99 monthly price tag but will mean users can download mp3s in seconds and offers tv-quality video streaming. the service includes wifi as standard  meaning users can connect multiple pcs  laptops and game consoles from any room in the house. not everybody will be able to take advantage of the service  as it will be restricted to metropolitan areas. the service will initially be available to users within 2km radius of 230 telephone exchanges in areas such as london  birmingham  glasgow and cambridge. that represents about 4.4 million households. the service is possible due to a decision to loosen bt s strangle-hold on telephone exchanges.  the process  known as local loop unbundling  was put in motion by the now defunct telecoms watchdog oftel but has only proved popular in recent months due to falling costs. uk online is looking at the possibility of bundling services such as cheap net telephone calls  video-on-demand and tv by 2005 if the service proves popular.  the service is twice as fast as any other service on offer in the uk and 16 times faster than most broadband services   said mr stening.  it takes a big leap for broadband and we are very excited about it   he said. countries such as south korea and france have found the advantage of upping the speeds of broadband. in south korea  video-on-demand over the net is cheaper than renting a dvd and online gaming is huge. mr stening believes the service will appeal to people in multi-occupancy buildings as well as easing family arguments.  a typical family with two adults and two children is currently sharing a 512 kilobit service. this will basically give them 2 megabits each   he said.,uk broadband get speed inject broadband rapid rise continu apac speed gear notch eight megabit servic launch internet servic provid uk onlin time faster averag broadband packag market pave way servic videoondemand broadband tv servic possibl due new regim allow oper use bt exchang initi avail town repres big leap forward broadband say chri stene uk onlin gener manag servic come hefti £ monthli price tag mean user download mp second offer tvqualiti video stream servic includ wifi standard mean user connect multipl pc laptop game consol room hous everybodi abl take advantag servic restrict metropolitan area servic initi avail user within km radiu telephon exchang area london birmingham glasgow cambridg repres million household servic possibl due decis loosen bt stranglehold telephon exchang process know local loop unbundl put motion defunct telecom watchdog oftel prove popular recent month due fall cost uk onlin look possibl bundl servic cheap net telephon call videoondemand tv servic prove popular servic twice fast servic offer uk time faster broadband servic say mr stene take big leap broadband excit say countri south korea franc found advantag up speed broadband south korea videoondemand net cheaper rent dvd onlin game huge mr stene believ servic appeal peopl multioccup build well ea famili argument typic famili two adult two child current share kilobit servic basic give megabit say

382,778,eu fraud clampdown urged eu member states are failing to report fraud and irregularities in eu funds on a consistent basis  the uk s public spending watchdog has said.  the national audit office said although the latest figures showed reported fraud was falling  the eu still had no common definition of fraud. it also expressed concern that  for the 10th year  the european court of auditors had qualified the eu accounts. the nao urged the government to push for improvements in reporting fraud. it said member states needed to be more accountable on how money was spent. the report said:  member states still do not report fraud and other irregularities to the european anti-fraud office on a consistent basis.   as the court has now qualified its opinion on the community accounts for a decade  it is essential for all the authorities involved to contribute to the strengthening of the audit of eu revenue and expenditure and improving accountability for the financial management and use of eu resources.  it said there were 922 cases of reported fraud or irregularities in eu funds in the uk in 2003  worth £38.5m (52m euros)  up from 831 cases worth £35.7m in 2002. at the same time  reported fraud throughout the eu dropped from 10 276 cases worth £808m to 8 177 cases worth £644m. edward leigh  chairman of the commons public accounts committee  said britain had to set an example when it assumed the eu presidency.   any fraud in other member states is potentially fraud against the uk taxpayer  given that we are the second largest net contributor to the community   he said.  departments responsible for administering eu funds need to make sure that they re doing everything possible to weed out improper spending.  the government must take the opportunity afforded by the uk presidency of the eu to press the commission and other member states to take an equally robust stance against fraud and irregularity  and raise overall standards of financial management.  a spokesman for the european anti-fraud office said the organisation agreed with the nao s assessment of fraud reporting.  the quality of reporting does differ from member state to member state  and there is room for improvement   spokesman jorg wojahn said. he added that there is generally good co-operation with member states and the anti-fraud office on specific cases of fraud  with the statistics studied by nao providing a  good overview for planning strategic ways of detecting fraud .,eu fraud clampdown urg eu member state fail report fraud irregular eu fund consist basi uk public spend watchdog say nation audit offic say although late figur show report fraud fall eu still common definit fraud also express concern th year european court auditor qualifi eu account nao urg govern push improv report fraud say member state need account money spent report say member state still report fraud irregular european antifraud offic consist basi court qualifi opinion commun account decad essenti author involv contribut strengthen audit eu revenu expenditur improv account financi manag use eu resourc say case report fraud irregular eu fund uk worth £m m euro case worth £m time report fraud throughout eu drop case worth £m case worth £m edward leigh chairman common public account committe say britain set exampl assum eu presid fraud member state potenti fraud uk taxpay give second large net contributor commun say depart respons administ eu fund need make sure everyth possibl weed improp spend govern must take opportun afford uk presid eu press commiss member state take equal robust stanc fraud irregular rais overal standard financi manag spokesman european antifraud offic say organis agre nao ass fraud report qualiti report differ member state member state room improv spokesman jorg wojahn say ad gener good cooper member state antifraud offic specif case fraud statist studi nao provid good overview plan strateg way detect fraud

384,2032,hi-tech posters guide commuters interactive posters are helping londoners get around the city during the festive season.  when interrogated with a mobile phone  the posters pass on a number that people can call to get information about the safest route home. sited at busy underground stations  the posters are fitted with an infra-red port that can beam information directly to a handset. the posters are part of transport for london s safe travel at night campaign.  the campaign is intended to help londoners  especially women  avoid trouble on the way home. in particular it aims to cut the number of sexual assaults by drivers of unlicensed minicabs. nigel marson  head of group marketing at transport for london (tfl)  said the posters were useful because they work outside the mobile phone networks.  they can work in previously inaccessible areas such as underground stations which is obviously a huge advantage in a campaign of this sort   he said.  the posters will automatically beam information to any phone equipped with an ir port that is held close to the glowing red icon on the poster.  we started with infra-red because there are a huge number ir phones out there   said rachel harker  spokeswoman for hypertag which makes the technology fitted to the posters.  it s a well established technology.  hypertag is also now making a poster that uses short-range bluetooth radio technology to swap data. although the hypertags in the posters only pass on a phone number  ms harker said they can pass on almost any form of data including images  ring tones and video clips. she said that there are no figures for how many people are using the posters but a previous campaign run for a cosmetics firm racked up 12 500 interactions.  before we ran a campaign there was a big question mark of:  if we build it will they come    she said.  now we know that  yes  they will.  the tfl campaign using the posters will run until boxing day.,hitech poster guid commut interact poster help london get around citi festiv season interrog mobil phone poster pas number peopl call get inform safest rout home site busi underground station poster fit infrar port beam inform directli handset poster part transport london safe travel night campaign campaign intend help london especi woman avoid troubl way home particular aim cut number sexual assault driver unlicens minicab nigel marson head group market transport london tfl say poster use work outsid mobil phone network work previous inaccess area underground station obvious huge advantag campaign sort say poster automat beam inform phone equip ir port held close glow red icon poster start infrar huge number ir phone say rachel harker spokeswoman hypertag make technolog fit poster well establish technolog hypertag also make poster use shortrang bluetooth radio technolog swap data although hypertag poster pas phone number m harker say pas almost form data includ imag ring tone video clip say figur mani peopl use poster previou campaign run cosmet firm rack interact ran campaign big question mark build come say know ye tfl campaign use poster run box day
385,2144,camera phones are  must-haves  four times more mobiles with cameras in them will be sold in europe by the end of 2004 than last year  says a report from analysts gartner.  globally  the number sold will reach 159 million  an increase of 104%. the report predicts that nearly 70% of all mobile phones sold will have a built-in camera by 2008. improving imaging technology in mobiles is making them an increasingly  must-have  buy. in europe  cameras on mobiles can take 1.3 megapixel images. but in japan and asia pacific  where camera phone technology is much more advanced  mobiles have already been released which can take 3.2 megapixel images. japan still dominates mobile phone technology  and the uptake there is huge. by 2008  according to gartner  95% of all mobiles sold there will have cameras on them.  camera phones had some teething problems when they were first launched as people struggled with poor quality images and uses for them  as well as the complexity and expense of sending them via mms (multimedia messaging services). this has changed in the last 18 months. handset makers have concentrated on trying to make phones easier to use. realising that people like to use their camera phones in different ways  they have introduced more design features  like rotating screens and viewfinders  removable memory cards and easier controls to send picture messages.  mobile companies have introduced more ways for people to share photos with other people. these have included giving people easier ways to publish them on websites  or mobile blogs - moblogs. but the report suggests that until image quality increases more  people will not be interested in printing out pictures at kiosks. image sensor technology inside cameras phones is improving. the gartner report suggests that by mid-2005  it is likely that the image resolution of most camera phones will be more than two megapixels. consumer digital cameras images range from two to four megapixels in quality  and up to six megapixels on a high-end camera. but a lot of work is being done to make camera phones more like digital cameras. some handsets already feature limited zoom capability  and manufacturers are looking into technological improvements that will let people take more photos in poorly-lit conditions  like nightclubs. other developments include wide-angle modes  basic editing features  and better sensors and processors for recording film clips.  images from camera phones have even made it into the art world. an exhibition next month in aid of the charity mencap  will feature snaps taken from the camera phones of top artists.  the exhibition  fonetography  will feature images taken by photographers david bailey  rankin and nan goldin  and artists sir peter blake  tracey emin and jack vettriano. but some uses for them have worried many organisations. intel  samsung  the uk s foreign office and lawrence livermore national laboratories in the us  have decided to ban camera phones from their buildings for fear of sensitive information being snapped and leaked. many schools  fitness centres and local councils have also banned them over fears about privacy and misuse. italy s information commissioner has also voiced concern and has issued guidelines on where and how the phones can be used. but camera phone fears have not dampened the manufacturers  profits. according to recent figures  sony ericsson s profits tripled in the third-quarter because of new camera phones. over 60% of mobiles sold during the three months through to september featured integrated cameras  it said.,camera phone musthav four time mobil camera sell europ end last year say report analyst gartner global number sell reach million increas report predict nearli mobil phone sell builtin camera improv imag technolog mobil make increasingli musthav buy europ camera mobil take megapixel imag japan asia pacif camera phone technolog much advanc mobil alreadi releas take megapixel imag japan still domin mobil phone technolog uptak huge accord gartner mobil sell camera camera phone teeth problem first launch peopl struggl poor qualiti imag use well complex expens send via mm multimedia messag servic chang last month handset maker concentr tri make phone easy use realis peopl like use camera phone differ way introduc design featur like rotat screen viewfind remov memori card easy control send pictur messag mobil compani introduc way peopl share photo peopl includ give peopl easy way publish websit mobil blog moblog report suggest imag qualiti increas peopl interest print pictur kiosk imag sensor technolog insid camera phone improv gartner report suggest mid like imag resolut camera phone two megapixel consum digit camera imag rang two four megapixel qualiti six megapixel highend camera lot work do make camera phone like digit camera handset alreadi featur limit zoom capabl manufactur look technolog improv let peopl take photo poorlylit condit like nightclub develop includ wideangl mode basic edit featur well sensor processor record film clip imag camera phone even make art world exhibit next month aid chariti mencap featur snap take camera phone top artist exhibit fonetographi featur imag take photograph david bailey rankin nan goldin artist sir peter blake tracey emin jack vettriano use worri mani organis intel samsung uk foreign offic lawrenc livermor nation laboratori u decid ban camera phone build fear sensit inform snap leak mani school fit centr local council also ban fear privaci misus itali inform commission also voic concern issu guidelin phone use camera phone fear dampen manufactur profit accord recent figur soni ericsson profit tripl thirdquart new camera phone mobil sell three month septemb featur integr camera say
386,1544,best person  for top legal job the  best person for the job  should be appointed lord chancellor  and not necessarily a lawyer or mp  the courts minister has told mps.  under reforms  the post of lord chancellor is to be stripped of its judicial functions.  the lord chancellor...no more needs to be a lawyer than the secretary of health needs to be a doctor   said courts minister christopher leslie. the constitutional reform bill was entering its second reading on monday. mr leslie said:  the prime minister should be able to appoint the best person for the job whether they sit in the house of lords or the house of commons.  under the reforms  the law lords will also be replaced as the uk s highest legal authority by a supreme court and judges will be appointed by an independent panel rather than ministers.  in december the lords rejected a plea by current lord chancellor lord falconer that the holder of the job should not necessarily be a lawyer or a peer. the peers voted by 229 to 206 to say in law that lord chancellors must also be peers. the debate was carried over from the last parliamentary session  but with an impending general election time is crucial for the government to get the bill passed. mr leslie said it was irrelevant whether the post was called secretary of state for constitutional affairs or lord chancellor. he said:  what matters most is...whether it is reformed so that the post holder no longer has those conflicting duties.  it is no longer appropriate for a government minister to have such unfettered discretion in the appointment of judges.   shadow attorney general dominic grieve criticised the government on its plans to change what he said was an  exceptional institution   providing a  champion of the independence of the judiciary . the government had initially proposed to take this institution and  smash it to pieces   mr grieve said. convention should be  nurtured and celebrated   but the government distrusted and disliked it instead. he warned that unless ministers backed down over the lord chancellor remaining a member of the house of lords  the government would have  great difficulty  in getting the bill through parliament. former cabinet minister douglas hogg  whose father and grandfather served as lord chancellor  said the bill was  largely unnecessary  bureaucratic and expensive . but the tory mp for sleaford and north hykeham admitted the lord chancellor s role and office  cannot be frozen in aspic .,best person top legal job best person job appoint lord chancellor necessarili lawyer mp court minist told mp reform post lord chancellor strip judici function lord chancellorno need lawyer secretari health need doctor say court minist christoph lesli constitut reform bill enter second read monday mr lesli say prime minist abl appoint best person job whether sit hous lord hous common reform law lord also replac uk high legal author suprem court judg appoint independ panel rather minist decemb lord reject plea current lord chancellor lord falcon holder job necessarili lawyer peer peer vote say law lord chancellor must also peer debat carri last parliamentari session impend gener elect time crucial govern get bill pas mr lesli say irrelev whether post call secretari state constitut affair lord chancellor say matter iswheth reform post holder longer conflict duti longer appropri govern minist unfett discret appoint judg shadow attorney gener domin griev criticis govern plan chang say except institut provid champion independ judiciari govern initi propos take institut smash piec mr griev say convent nurtur celebr govern distrust dislik instead warn unless minist back lord chancellor remain member hous lord govern would great difficulti get bill parliament former cabinet minist dougla hogg whose father grandfath serv lord chancellor say bill larg unnecessari bureaucrat expens torus mp sleaford north hykeham admit lord chancellor role offic frozen aspic
387,207,lib dems highlight problem debt people vulnerable to problem debts should be afforded greater protection from banks aggressively promoting financial products  the lib dems say.  vincent cable says one in eight households already struggle with debt and that will worsen if there is a hike in interest rates or unemployment. the lib dems  treasury spokesman is unveiling a policy aimed at the issue. he wants to see  proper health checks  when loans are marketed so people know to take out payment protection.   were economic conditions to deteriorate at all  large numbers of people could be affected because they have borrowed to the limit   mr cable told bbc news.  banks are very aggressively promoting debt in many cases there is a bigger problem ahead.  mr cable said the government s consumer credit bill would target some of the  extreme problems  such as loan sharking  but ministers had been  a bit complacent  about the wider issue of debt levels. he said much of the payment protection currently available was  extremely expensive  and there were  lots of exclusions .  mr cable added that the office of fair trading should investigate the market. lib dem leader charles kennedy meanwhile is in the middle of a tour of the uk aimed at persuading voters his is the  real opposition . mr kennedy is visiting a mixture of rural seats  where his party is hoping to make gains from the conservatives  and urban areas traditionally associated with labour. labour say a lib dem vote could  let the tories in   while the tories say the lib dems would mean  higher taxes  soft crime laws  more power to europe . mr kennedy s tour comes as he  labour leader tony blair and conservative leader michael howard all step up campaigning ahead of the next general election  widely expected to be held on 5 may.  the liberal democrats say in the northern cities  the race is between them and labour  while in southern seats - particularly the south west - it is between them and the tories. speaking to the bbc s westminster hour on sunday  mr kennedy said the upcoming general election - widely tipped for 5 may - would be much more unpredictable than any others in  recent experience . and he brushed off labour suggestions a vote for his party would mean letting the tories in  by the back door .  if you look at the four previous parliamentary by-elections  the liberal democrats have demonstrated that  not only can we leapfrog the conservatives where we start in a third place position  but we can go on to defeat the government.  that s going to be the story  i think  of this coming general election.,lib dem highlight problem debt peopl vulner problem debt afford great protect bank aggress promot financi product lib dem say vincent cabl say one eight household alreadi struggl debt worsen hike interest rate unemploy lib dem treasuri spokesman unveil polici aim issu want see proper health check loan market peopl know take payment protect econom condit deterior larg number peopl could affect borrow limit mr cabl told bbc news bank aggress promot debt mani case big problem ahead mr cabl say govern consum credit bill would target extrem problem loan shark minist bit complac wider issu debt level say much payment protect current avail extrem expens lot exclus mr cabl ad offic fair trade investig market lib dem leader charl kennedi meanwhil middl tour uk aim persuad voter real opposit mr kennedi visit mixtur rural seat parti hope make gain conserv urban area tradit associ labour labour say lib dem vote could let torus torus say lib dem would mean high tax soft crime law power europ mr kennedi tour come labour leader toni blair conserv leader michael howard step campaign ahead next gener elect wide expect held may liber democrat say northern citi race labour southern seat particularli south west torus speak bbc westminst hour sunday mr kennedi say upcom gener elect wide tip may would much unpredict other recent experi brush labour suggest vote parti would mean let torus back door look four previou parliamentari byelect liber democrat demonstr leapfrog conserv start third place posit go defeat govern go stori think come gener elect

389,818,no more concessions  on terror charles clarke says he has  no desire  to offer more concessions on his controversial anti-terror plans to get them on to the statute book.  mps voted in favour of the prevention of terrorism bill after mr clarke agreed to key changes - but labour s majority was reduced to 14. the bill now faces opposition from peers angry at house arrest proposals. lord strathclyde  tory leader in the lords  said ministers should expect it to be  substantially re-written .  the bill proposes  control orders   which as well as house arrest could impose curfews  tagging or bans on telephone and internet use. they would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial  which the law lords have ruled against.  on monday  mps voted 272-219 in favour of the bill after key concessions from mr clarke. the government earlier saw its 161-strong majority cut to just 14 as a cross-party amendment was narrowly rejected by the commons despite the support of 62 labour rebels. mr clarke won over critics by announcing he would introduce an amendment in the lords to ensure the most controversial control order  amounting to house arrest  would be imposed by judges and not politicians. lord strathclyde warned ministers that they should  prepare themselves for substantial rewriting of various aspects of the bill .  they should consider far more seriously the use of intercept evidence in any trial and i think they should drop the most objectionable proposals  which are for house arrest.   but mr clarke told bbc radio 4 s today programme he believed the changes he had made to the bill to win over critics in the commons should be sufficient to satisfy colleagues in the lords.  no bill goes through parliament without detailed consideration being made  but i believe that what i announced yesterday will be sufficient to secure the agreement of the house of lords   he said.   i have no desire to make further so-called concessions on the bill.  mr clarke s proposed amendment will be debated by the lords on tuesday without having been considered by mps. the debate is unlikely to result in a vote. speaking after the commons debate  shadow home secretary david davies said the bill had been  clearly very badly drawn-up  and that the government was trying to rush it through too quickly. he said it would be possible to  rescue  the government and make the law  tolerable  by amending it in the lords.  the scope for miscarriages of justice is enormous   he told bbc news.  mark oaten  for the liberal democrats  said monday night s vote showed the government had  lost the confidence of all sides of the house . he said:  they need to rethink the bill  and extend the power of a judge to decide on all control orders  build safeguards on evidence and create charges against suspects.  unless there is a major movement  this bill is doomed to fail.   bbc news political editor andrew marr said:  i think that this is a bill in deep trouble. it s been unravelling in the house of commons - it may unravel further.  the government wants the new bill to pass into law by 14 march  when the current powers expire.,concess terror charl clark say desir offer concess controversi antiterror plan get statut book mp vote favour prevent terror bill mr clark agre key chang labour major reduc bill face opposit peer angri hous arrest propos lord strathclyd torus leader lord say minist expect substanti rewrite bill propos control order well hous arrest could impos curfew tag ban telephon internet use would replac current power detain foreign terror suspect without trial law lord rule monday mp vote favour bill key concess mr clark govern earlier saw strong major cut crossparti amend narrowli reject common despit support labour rebel mr clark critic announc would introduc amend lord ensur controversi control order amount hous arrest would impos judg politician lord strathclyd warn minist prepar substanti rewrit variou aspect bill consid far serious use intercept evid trial think drop objection propos hous arrest mr clark told bbc radio today programm believ chang make bill win critic common suffici satisfi colleagu lord bill goe parliament without detail consider make believ announc yesterday suffici secur agreement hous lord say desir make socal concess bill mr clark propos amend debat lord tuesday without consid mp debat unlik result vote speak common debat shadow home secretari david davi say bill clearli badli drawnup govern tri rush quickli say would possibl rescu govern make law toler amend lord scope miscarriag justic enorm told bbc news mark oaten liber democrat say monday night vote show govern lose confid side hous say need rethink bill extend power judg decid control order build safeguard evid creat charg suspect unless major movement bill doom fail bbc news polit editor andrew marr say think bill deep troubl unravel hous common may unravel govern want new bill pas law march current power expir

394,888,minister defends hunting ban law the law banning hunting with dogs in england and wales is enforceable and  very clear   alun michael has said.  the rural affairs minister said it would become obvious if people flouted the law  which came into force on friday  and pretended they were not. some 270 hunts met legally on saturday killing a total of 91 foxes - only four were accidentally killed by hounds. but anti-hunt campaigners said there had been widespread intimidation of activists monitoring hunts. countryside alliance chairman john jackson said that saturday had been a  massive demonstration by the rural community of support for hunting . people had turned out  to show en masse that the hunting act was a bad law   he said adding that foxes and other animals had been killed  legally  as far as he was aware.  although hunting with dogs is now a criminal offence  exercising hounds  chasing a scent trail and flushing out foxes to be shot are still legal. addressing claims that the new law was unenforceable  mr michael told bbc radio 4 s today programme:  there has been a lot of spin about this by those that support hunting.  the reality is that the law is very clear. you can t chase wild mammals with a pack of dogs  whether the wild mammal is a fox or a deer.  if people do so and pretend they re not it s going to become very clear. you can t hunt accidentally.  mr michael also denied the hunting ban had led to a breakdown of trust between the government and rural communities. he said most people living in the countryside were more concerned with issues like the economy  the health service and their children s future than hunting.  but the league against cruel sports claimed the new act had been broken even though the numbers of foxes killed had fallen. thousands of hunt supporters turned out at 270 hunts across england and wales on the first day of the ban  with anti-hunt groups sending out 100 monitors to check the law was not being broken. there were only four arrests - over alleged hunting of hares in wiltshire - although it was not clear whether they were made under the hunting act.  they have been released on bail but police say they may face prosecution under new poaching laws. but penny little  who monitored the bicester hunt in oxfordshire  said she had witnessed  gratuitous  spiteful killing of foxes . if people tried to  run circles around this law  the only outcome would be that it was tightened up  she said. mike hobday  from the league against cruel sports  said video evidence of the law being broken would be passed onto police. he said intimidation seemed to have been widespread and called on hunts to do more to stop their supporters intimidating anti-hunt activists videoing hunts. but mr jackson  who had been at the bicester hunt in oxfordshire  denied there was any intimidation.,minist defend hunt ban law law ban hunt dog england wale enforc clear alun michael say rural affair minist say would becom obviou peopl flout law come forc friday pretend hunt met legal saturday kill total fox four accident kill hound antihunt campaign say widespread intimid activist monitor hunt countrysid allianc chairman john jackson say saturday massiv demonstr rural commun support hunt peopl turn show en mass hunt act bad law say ad fox anim kill legal far awar although hunt dog crimin offenc exercis hound chase scent trail flush fox shot still legal address claim new law unenforc mr michael told bbc radio today programm lot spin support hunt realiti law clear chase wild mammal pack dog whether wild mammal fox deer peopl pretend go becom clear hunt accident mr michael also deni hunt ban lead breakdown trust govern rural commun say peopl live countrysid concern issu like economi health servic child futur hunt leagu cruel sport claim new act broken even though number fox kill fall thousand hunt support turn hunt across england wale first day ban antihunt group send monitor check law broken four arrest alleg hunt hare wiltshir although clear whether make hunt act releas bail polic say may face prosecut new poach law penni littl monitor bicest hunt oxfordshir say wit gratuit spite kill fox peopl tri run circl around law outcom would tighten say mike hobday leagu cruel sport say video evid law broken would pas onto polic say intimid seem widespread call hunt stop support intimid antihunt activist video hunt mr jackson bicest hunt oxfordshir deni intimid
395,202,profits stall at china s lenovo profits at chinese computer firm lenovo have stood still amid slowing demand at home and stiffening competition.  the firm is in the international spotlight after last year signing a deal to buy the pc division of personal computer pioneer ibm. lenovo s profit for the three months to december was hk$327m (us$42m; £22m)  less than 1% up on the year before. chinese pc sales have risen by a fifth in each of the past two years  but are now growing more slowly. the company is still by far the biggest player in china  with more than a quarter of the market. but western firms such as dell and hewlett-packard are also mounting a more solid fight for market share in china  and lenovo s sales were down 3.7% by revenue to hk$6.31bn.  if the $1.75bn agreement lenovo signed with ibm on 8 december goes through  it will mark the end of an era. ibm pioneered the desktop pc market in the early 1980s  although strategic mis-steps helped lose it its early dominance. in any case  margins in pc market are now wafer thin  and profits have been hard to come by for most vendors except direct-sales giant dell. but investors have been less than impressed with lenovo s move  designed to take it out of china and further onto the world stage. its shares are down 20% since the announcement two months ago  largely because of the unprofitability of the unit it is buying. there have been rumours that the deal could be in trouble because us government agencies fear it could offer china opportunities for industrial espionage. the reports of the possibility of an investigation into the risk sent lenovo s shares up 6% in late january.,profit stall china lenovo profit chine comput firm lenovo stood still amid slow demand home stiffen competit firm intern spotlight last year sign deal buy pc divis person comput pioneer ibm lenovo profit three month decemb hkm usm £m less year chine pc sale risen fifth past two year grow slowli compani still far big player china quarter market western firm dell hewlettpackard also mount solid fight market share china lenovo sale revenu hkbn bn agreement lenovo sign ibm decemb goe mark end era ibm pioneer desktop pc market earli s although strateg misstep help lose earli domin case margin pc market wafer thin profit hard come vendor except directsal giant dell investor less impress lenovo move design take china onto world stage share sinc announc two month ago larg unprofit unit buy rumour deal could troubl u govern agenc fear could offer china opportun industri espionag report possibl investig risk sent lenovo share late januari
396,1452,egypt to sell off state-owned bank the egyptian government is reportedly planning to privatise one of the country s big public banks.  an investment ministry official has told the reuters news agency that the bank of alexandria will be sold sometime in 2005. the move is seen as evidence of a new commitment by the government to reduce the size of public sector. the official said the government has not yet decided whether the sale will take the form of a public flotation.  the most important thing to decide now is the method - whether by selling shares to the public or to a strategic investor from abroad   he said.  analysts say the public-sector banks have suited the government s monetary  credit and exchange policies. nevertheless  the egyptian government has spoken for years about privatising one of the big four state banks - banque misr  national bank of egypt  banque du caire and bank of alexandria. it had been expected one of the smallest of the four big public banks - bank of alexandria or banque du caire - would be sold first. the announcement reinforces the hopes of investors and international financial bodies for a revival of egypt s privatisation programme. about 190 state-run companies and facilities were sold off from the early 1990s to 1997. the appointment of mahmoud mohieldin  a reform-minded technocrat  to the new post of investment minister in july was taken as a sign that more sell-offs were on the way. both the imf and world bank have urged egypt to remove obstacles to the development of the private sector which they say has a vital role to play in reducing poverty by expanding the economy.,egypt sell stateown bank egyptian govern reportedli plan privatis one countri big public bank invest ministri offici told reuter news agenc bank alexandria sell sometim move see evid new commit govern reduc size public sector offici say govern yet decid whether sale take form public flotat import thing decid method whether sell share public strateg investor abroad say analyst say publicsector bank suit govern monetari credit exchang polici nevertheless egyptian govern spoken year privatis one big four state bank banqu misr nation bank egypt banqu du cair bank alexandria expect one small four big public bank bank alexandria banqu du cair would sell first announc reinforc hope investor intern financi bodi reviv egypt privatis programm staterun compani facil sell earli s appoint mahmoud mohieldin reformmind technocrat new post invest minist juli take sign selloff way imf world bank urg egypt remov obstacl develop privat sector say vital role play reduc poverti expand economi

399,1368,howard denies split over id cards michael howard has denied his shadow cabinet was split over its decision to back controversial labour plans to introduce id cards.  the tory leader said his front bench team had reached a  collective view  after holding a  good discussion   but admitted it was  not an easy issue . he had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror  crime and illegal immigration. the lib dems have pledged to oppose the bill when it is debated next monday.  tory sources say senior party figures had argued vociferously against the id card scheme. among those reported to have serious reservations over the strategy were senior shadow cabinet members david davis  oliver letwin and tim yeo. but mr howard denied mr yeo  his transport and environment spokesman  said the plans  stink . he also said he was confident shadow home secretary mr davis would  set out the position very clearly  when he stands up to debate the matter next week. mr howard said the police had said id cards could  help them foil a terror bomb plot in which people could lose their lives . he added:  when the police say that you have to take them seriously .  he acknowledged there were  good libertarian arguments  against the cards  but said the shadow cabinet had weighed up all the  conflicting interests  before reaching its decision.  i don t pretend that it is an easy decision but at the end of the day a decision has to be taken.  he also denied he was afraid of looking  soft  on the issue  compared to labour. the conservatives announced their support for the government plans on monday evening.  sources within the party told the bbc mr howard had always been in favour of id cards  and tried to introduce them when he was home secretary. but the tories insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme.  they said they would also press labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the home office would be able to deliver them. and they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of id cards and whether people s privacy would be properly protected.  it is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect   a spokesman said. lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten has branded the id scheme a waste of money and  deeply flawed . he said:  this has all the signs of michael howard overruling colleagues  concerns over id cards.   the chairman of the bar council  guy mansfield qc warned there was a real risk that people on the  margins of society  would be driven into the hands of extremists.  what is going to happen to young asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere  they are going to be stopped. if they haven t [id cards] they are going to be detained.  tory ex-minister douglas hogg said he opposed the plans for id cards branding them a  regressive  step which would intrude into the lives of ordinary citizens without any counterbalancing benefits. he predicted ultimately carrying the cards would become compulsory and that would lead to large numbers of britain s ethnic minorities being stopped by police.,howard deni

408,1354,jowell confirms casino climbdown tessa jowell has announced plans to limit the number of new casinos in the uk to 24  in a move branded a  humiliating retreat  by the tories.  it puts an end to plans for up to 40 super casinos  originally outlined in the government s gambling bill. instead there will be a cap of eight new casinos in each size category - small  medium and large. the culture secretary said the move showed she listened to critics who feared an explosion in gambling.  but conservative shadow culture secretary john whittingdale said the way the government had handled the bill was a  shambles .  this announcement is a further humiliating retreat by the government.  instead of the initial intention of the gambling bill  to liberalise the rules governing gambling  the bill now imposes a more restrictive regime than exists at present.  shares in british casino operators london clubs international  rank group and stanley leisure  who had been hoping the bill would pave the way for a big expansion in smaller casinos  fell by between 10 and 25% following the announcement. ms jowell s deputy  richard caborn  said the government had adopted a cautious approach to the issue  and responded to the concerns raised.  limiting the number of regional casinos to eight in the first phase is a cautious move that will allow us to test the impact of a new kind of casino on the levels of problem gambling   he said.  we also believe it s right to apply this same level of caution to small and large casinos.   he added that local authorities would still be able to stop new casinos coming to their areas. church groups welcomed the limit on the number of casinos. salvation army spokesman jonathan lomax said:  the proliferation of these casinos on high streets across the country was a real concern and the [three year] trial period  which we think should last at least five years  will enable research into the potentially severe social consequences of an increase in hard and addictive forms of gambling.  but british british casino association chairman penny cobham said her members were  outraged  by the decision  which followed a campaign in the daily mail newspaper.  there was never going to be a massive explosion of casinos. talk of a casino on every high street was just a scaring tactic.,jowel confirm casino climbdown tessa jowel announc plan limit number new casino uk move brand humili retreat torus put end plan super casino origin outlin govern gambl bill instead cap eight new casino size categori small medium larg cultur secretari say move show listen critic fear explos gambl conserv shadow cultur secretari john whittingdal say way govern handl bill shambl announc humili retreat govern instead initi intent gambl bill liberalis rule govern gambl bill impos restrict regim exist present share british casino oper london club intern rank group stanley leisur hope bill would pave way big expans small casino fell follow announc m jowel deputi richard caborn say govern adopt cautiou approach issu respond concern rais limit number region casino eight first phase cautiou move allow u test impact new kind casino level problem gambl say also believ right appli level caution small larg casino ad local author would still abl stop new casino come area church group welcom limit number casino salvat armi spokesman jonathan lomax say prolifer casino high street across countri real concern three year trial period think last least five year enabl research potenti sever social consequ increas hard addict form gambl british british casino associ chairman penni cobham say member outrag decis follow campaign daili mail newspap never go massiv explos casino talk casino everi high street scare tactic
409,520,no to royal succession shake-up a labour peer has withdrawn proposals to give female members of the royal family the same rights as males.  the legislation would have ended the right of male heirs with older sisters to succeed to the crown. it would also have torn up ancient legislation banning heirs to the throne marrying roman catholics. but the government refused to back lord dubs  succession to the crown bill  saying it was too complex and raised too many constitutional issues.  the lord chancellor  lord falconer  agreed the 1701 act of settlement  which governs the succession  was discriminatory but added that  for all practical purposes its effects are limited .  the changes proposed by lord dubs were a  complex and controversial undertaking raising major constitutional issues   he said. lord falconer said there were 22 members of the royal family in the line of succession after the prince of wales - all of who were eligible to succeed and had been unaffected by the act.  it is not a simple matter that can be tinkered with lightly. while we wish to remove all forms of discrimination... this isn t the proper form   he added.  he did not rule out change in the future but said if lord dubs  private member s bill was passed by peers  he would urge mps to oppose it in the commons. lord dubs agreed to withdraw his bill after its second reading in the house of lords  but urged the government to think again at a later stage.  we cannot forever say we don t want to change things because it is too difficult   he told peers. during the debate  the labour peer and former minister said:  the monarchy should symbolise the values of this country.  what we don t want is a situation where the values of the country have moved on and the monarchy is centuries behind the times.  we are surely all opposed to discrimination on the grounds of gender and we are surely also opposed to discrimination against catholics.  but opponents of the bill  including tory lord campbell of alloway and the bishop of winchester  the rt rev michael scott-joynt  said it would separate the state from both the church of england and the christian faith. such a  secular  state would be markedly  less tolerant   rt rev scott-joynt argued.,royal success shakeup labour peer withdrawn propos give femal member royal famili right male legisl would end right male heir old sister succeed crown would also torn ancient legisl ban heir throne marri roman cathol govern refus back lord dub success crown bill say complex rais mani constitut issu lord chancellor lord falcon agre act settlement govern success discriminatori ad practic purpos effect limit chang propos lord dub complex controversi undertak rais major constitut issu say lord falcon say member royal famili line success princ wale elig succeed unaffect act simpl matter tinker lightli wish remov form discrimin proper form ad rule chang futur say lord dub privat member bill pas peer would urg mp oppos common lord dub agre withdraw bill second read hous lord urg govern think later stage forev say want chang thing difficult told peer debat labour peer former minist say monarchi symbolis valu countri want situat valu countri move monarchi centuri behind time sure oppos discrimin ground gender sure also oppos discrimin cathol oppon bill includ torus lord campbel alloway bishop winchest rt rev michael scottjoynt say would separ state church england christian faith secular state would markedli less toler rt rev scottjoynt argu
410,802,ireland 19-13 england ireland consigned england to their third straight six nations defeat with a stirring victory at lansdowne road.  a second-half try from captain brian o driscoll and 14 points from ronan o gara kept ireland on track for their first grand slam since 1948. england scored first through martin corry but had  tries  from mark cueto and josh lewsey disallowed. andy robinson s men have now lost nine of their last 14 matches since the 2003 world cup final. the defeat also heralded england s worst run in the championship since 1987. ireland last won the title  then the five nations  in 1985  but 20 years on they share top spot in the table on maximum points with wales. and eddie o sullivan s side banished the ghosts of 2003 when england were rampant 42-6 victors in claiming the grand slam at lansdowne road. in front of a supercharged home crowd on a dry but blustery day in dublin  ireland tore into the white-shirted visitors from the kick-off and made their intentions clear when o gara landed a fourth-minute drop-goal.  england took their time to settle but their first real venture into ireland s half produced a simple score for corry. the number eight picked up the ball from the back of a ruck and found an absence of green jerseys between himself and the irish line  racing 25 yards to touch down. england fly-half charlie hodgson nailed the conversion from out on the left  but almost immediately o gara  winning his 50th cap  answered with two penalties in quick succession. england were awarded a penalty of their own on the halfway line after 20 minutes  and hodgson  the villain at twickenham  coolly bisected the posts. the first quarter was marked by periods of tactical kicking  but it was ireland who were showing more willingness to spread the ball wide to their eager and inventive backs. a series of probes led by the talismanic o driscoll  back from hamstring injury  resulted in a penalty but ireland chose to kick for touch.  from the line-out  the ball was recycled back to o gara  who stroked his second drop-goal  this time off the right upright. as the interval approached  wing josh lewsey was the catalyst for england s most promising attack. the wasps star raced up his touchline and hodgson s cross-kick put in mark cueto for an apparent score  but the sale wing was ruled to have started in front of the kicker. england began the second half well and had ireland pinned in their own half. but another english indiscretion on a rare irish break-out awarded o gara a kick at goal  which he missed. england s pressure continued  and a wave of attacks saw centre jamie noon dragged down yards from the line before hodgson landed a drop-goal.  the lead was shortlived  however. ireland raced upfield  deft handling from the backs  including a clever dummy from geordan murphy on hodgson  ending with o driscoll going over in the right corner and touching down close to the posts. o gara missed a penalty which would have put ireland nine points clear  and the home crowd breathed a sigh of relief when hodgson s cross-kick was fumbled by lock ben kay near the line. anticipation of a home win sent the noise level sky-high  but o gara missed another chance to seal the game with a wayward drop-goal attempt. inside the last 10 minutes  england poured forward  spurred on by scrum-half matt dawson  who replaced leicester s harry ellis. but despite one near miss with the pack over the line - not checked on the tv replay by referee jonathan kaplan - england were unable to pull off a face-saving win. ireland next face france at lansdowne road in two weeks  time before the potential title decider against wales in cardiff. england are still to meet italy at twickenham  in what is now a wooden spoon decider  and scotland.  g murphy;

411,1715,ultra fast wi-fi nears completion ultra high speed wi-fi connections moved closer to reality on thursday when intel said it would list standards for the technology later this year.  intel is developing ultra-wideband technology (uwb) which would allow fast data transfer but with low power needs. uwb is tipped to be used for wireless transfer of video in the home or office and for use in wireless usb devices which need low power consumption. a rival uwb standard is being developed by motorola and chip firm freescale. at the mobile phone conference 3gsm in cannes last month samsung demonstrated a phone using uwb technology from freescale.  at a press conference on thursday intel announced that two uwb groups  wimedia alliance and multi-band ofdm alliance had merged to support the technology. uwb makes it possible to stream huge amounts of data through the air over short distances. one of the more likely uses of uwb is to make it possible to send dvd quality video images wirelessly to tv screens or to let people beam music to media players around their home.  the technology has the potential to transmit hundreds of megabits of data per second.  consumer electronics companies want uwb to replace cables and simplify set-up   jeff ravencraft  technology strategist at intel and chairman of the wireless usb promoter group  told technology site zdnet.  thirty percent of consumer electronics returns are because the consumer couldn t set up the equipment.  the first products using uwb technology from intel are due to hit the market later this year. initially they will be products using wireless usb 2.0 connections. uwb could also be used to create so-called personal area networks that let a person s gadgets quickly and easily swap data amongst themselves. the technology works over a range up to 10 metres and uses billions of short radio pulses every second to carry data. intel says the benefit of uwb is that it does not interfere with other wi-fi technologies already in use such as wi-fi  wimax and mobile phone networks.,ultra fast wifi near complet ultra high speed wifi connect move closer realiti thursday intel say would list standard technolog later year intel develop ultrawideband technolog uwb would allow fast data transfer low power need uwb tip use wireless transfer video home offic use wireless usb devic need low power consumpt rival uwb standard develop motorola chip firm freescal mobil phone confer gsm cann last month samsung demonstr phone use uwb technolog freescal press confer thursday intel announc two uwb group wimedia allianc multiband ofdm allianc merg support technolog uwb make possibl stream huge amount data air short distanc one like use uwb make possibl send dvd qualiti video imag wirelessli tv screen let peopl beam music medium player around home technolog potenti transmit hundr megabit data per second consum electron compani want uwb replac cabl simplifi setup jeff ravencraft technolog strategist intel chairman wireless usb promot group told technolog site zdnet thirti percent consum electron return consum set equip first product use uwb technolog intel due hit market later year initi product use wireless usb connect uwb could also use creat socal person area network let person gadget quickli easili swap data amongst technolog work rang metr use billion short radio pul everi second carri data intel say benefit uwb interfer wifi technolog alreadi use wifi wimax mobil phone network
412,1381,world leaders gather to face uncertainty more than 2 000 business and political leaders from around the globe are arriving in the swiss mountain resort davos for the annual world economic forum (wef). for five days  they will discuss issues ranging from china s economic power to iraq s future after this sunday s elections. uk prime minister tony blair and south african president thabo mbeki are among the more than 20 government leaders and heads of state leaders attending the meeting. unlike previous years  protests against the wef are expected to be muted. anti-globalisation campaigners have called off a demonstration planned for the weekend.  the brazilian city of porto alegre will host the rival world social forum  timed to run in parallel with the wef s ritzier event in davos.  the organisers of the brazilian gathering  which brings together thousands of campaigners against globalisation  for fair trade  and many other causes  have promised to set an alternative agenda to that of the swiss summit. however  many of the issues discussed in porto alegre are davos talking points as well.  global warming  features particularly high. wef participants are being asked to offset the carbon emissions they cause by travelling to the event. davos itself is in deep frost. the snow is piled high across the mountain village  and at night the wind chill takes temperatures down to minus 20c and less.  ultimately  the forum will be dominated by business issues - from outsourcing to corporate leadership - with bosses of more than a fifth of the world s 500 largest companies scheduled to attend.  but much of the media focus will be on the political leaders coming to davos  not least because the agenda of this year s forum seems to lack an overarching theme.  taking responsibility for tough choices  is this year s official talking point  hinting at a welter of knotty problems. one thing seems sure  though: transatlantic disagreements over how to deal with iran  iraq and china are set to dominate discussions. pointedly  only one senior official from president bush s new administration is scheduled to attend. the us government may still make a conciliatory gesture  just as happened a year ago when vice president dick cheney made a surprise appearance in davos.  ukraine s new president  viktor yushchenko  is to speak  just days after his inauguration  an event that crowned the civil protests against the rigged first election that had tried to keep him from power.  the european union s top leaders  among them german chancellor gerhard schroeder and european commission president manuel barosso  will be here too. mr blair will formally open the proceedings  although his speech will be pre-empted by french president jacques chirac  who announced his attendance at the last minute and secured a slot for a  special message  two hours before mr blair speaks. the organisers also hope that the new palestinian leader  mahmoud abbas  will use the opportunity for talks with at least one of the three israeli deputy prime ministers coming to the event  a list that includes shimon peres. davos fans still hark back to 1994  when talks between yassir arafat and mr peres came close to a peace deal. mr blair s appearance will be keenly watched too  as political observers in the uk claim it is a calculated snub against political rival chancellor gordon brown  who was supposed to lead the uk government delegation.  microsoft founder bill gates  the world s richest man and a regular at davos  will focus on campaigning for good causes  though business interests will not be wholly absent either. having already donated billions of dollars to the fight against aids and malaria  mr gates will call on world leaders to support a global vaccination campaign to protect children in developing countries from easily preventable diseases. on tuesday  mr gates pledged $750m (£400m) of his own money to support the cause. mr gates  company  software giant microsoft  also hopes to use davos to shore up its defences against open source software like linux  which threaten microsoft s near monopoly on computer desktops. mr gates is said to be trying to arrange a meeting with brazil s president lula da silva. the brazilian government has plans to switch all government computers from microsoft to linux. at davos  global problem solving

422,513,digital guru floats sub-$100 pc nicholas negroponte  chairman and founder of mit s media labs  says he is developing a laptop pc that will go on sale for less than $100 (£53).  he told the bbc world service programme go digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries. he said one laptop per child could be   very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family  village and neighbourhood . he said the child could use the laptop like a text book. he described the device as a stripped down laptop  which would run a linux-based operating system   we have to get the display down to below $20  to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel.   the second trick is to get rid of the fat   if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory.  the device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down. mr negroponte said this was a not for profit venture  though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money. in 1995 mr negroponte published the bestselling being digital  now widely seen as predicting the digital age. the concept is based on experiments in the us state of maine  where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on.  while the idea was popular amongst the children  it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken. however  mr negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops.  we put in 25 laptops three years ago   only one has been broken  the kids cherish these things  it s also a tv a telephone and a games machine  not just a textbook.  mr negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious.  nokia make 200 million cell phones a year  so for us to claim we re going to make 200 million laptops is a big number  but we re not talking about doing it in three or five years  we re talking about months.  he plans to be distributing them by the end of 2006 and is already in discussion with the chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order.  in china they spend $17 per child per year on textbooks. that s for five or six years  so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education that s cheaper and the marketing overheads go away.,digit guru float sub pc nichola negropont chairman founder mit medium lab say develop laptop pc go sale less £ told bbc world servic programm go digit hope would becom educ tool develop countri say one laptop per child could import develop child whole famili villag neighbourhood say child could use laptop like text book describ devic strip laptop would run linuxbas oper system get display need rear project imag rather use ordinari flat panel second trick get rid fat skinni gain speed abil use small processor slow memori devic probabl export kit part assembl local keep cost mr negropont say profit ventur though recognis manufactur compon would make money mr negropont publish bestsel digit wide see predict digit age concept base experi u state main child give laptop comput take home work idea popular amongst child initi receiv resist teacher problem laptop get broken howev mr negropont adapt idea work cambodia set two school togeth wife give child laptop put laptop three year ago one broken kid cherish thing also tv telephon game machin textbook mr negropont want laptop becom common mobil phone conced ambiti nokia make million cell phone year u claim go make million laptop big number talk three five year talk month plan distribut end alreadi discus chine educ ministri expect make larg order china spend per child per year textbook five six year distribut sell laptop quantiti one million ministri educ cheaper market overhead go away
423,1639,a november to remember last saturday  one newspaper proclaimed that england were still the number one side in the world.  that statement was made to look a little foolish by events later that afternoon at twickenham. but it illustrated the wonderful unpredictability of test rugby at the highest level  at the end of a richly entertaining autumn series. the final weekend threw the world pecking order into renewed confusion  with australia s triumph in london followed by france s capitulation to new zealand.  clearly  there is no number one side in the world at the moment   declared wallabies coach eddie jones on arrival back in sydney.  there are four  five or probably six sides all competing at the same level and on any given day the difference between one side and another is only about 1%.   while that bodes well for rugby as a whole  it also sharpens the sense of excitement ahead of what could be the most open six nations championship for a decade. while the wallabies  all blacks and springboks hit the beach before turning their attention to super 12 matters in the new year  europe s finest have less than 10 weeks before they return to the international fray. and for the first time in more than a decade  it will not simply be a straightforward choice between england and france for the six nations title.  that owes much to ireland s continued progress and the belief that wales are on the verge of delivering a major scalp to cement the promise of their autumn displays.    who secured a first triple crown in 19 years last season  could go one better and win their first five/six nations title since 1985. they start with away games against italy and scotland  before england and france come to lansdowne road.  their momentous victory over the springboks can only bolster ireland s self-belief  while ronan o gara s late drop goal to deliver victory over argentina was further proof that eddie o sullivan s side can now close out tight games. not that england or france  who have won nine of the last 10 six nations titles between them  will lay down quietly.  dismantling of the springboks suggested that even after the loss of such influential figures as martin johnson and lawrence dallaglio  they still have the personnel to prosper.  the narrow defeat to australia was a timely reminder that not everything is blooming in the red rose garden  but the fresh shoots of post-world cup recovery have been sown by new head coach andy robinson. a fresh desire to regain former heights is evident  and if england emerge triumphant from an opening six nations engagement in cardiff  a fourth title in six years is within reach.  are in familiar revival territory  but this time it appears there is substance behind the rediscovered style.  while south africa s over-confidence in cardiff made for a closer scoreline than expected  wales could legitimately claim to have had victory within their grasp against the all blacks in one of the best tests in recent memory. if mike ruddock can coax a reliable set-piece platform from his pack  there is no reason why victories should not ensue come february. the last fortnight has left  in a state of bewilderment after an autumn series that began with a superb victory over australia. a stunning defeat to argentina  their first loss since the world cup  could have been attributed to trademark french inconsistency.  but the manner of new zealand s 45-6 demolition job in paris has coach bernard laporte bemoaning a lack of young talent coming through to replace the old guard. fortunately for the french  the opening match of the six nations sees them entertaining  in paris. after two reasonable performances against australia  the scots  humbling by the springboks forced coach matt williams to reassess his belief that a win over one of the major nations was imminent. while individuals such as chris cusiter and ali hogg enhanced their reputations  a lack of top-class players will continue to undermine their best efforts.    who start with home games against ireland and wales before travelling to scotland  are also hopeful of registering more than one victory for the first time in the championship. as autumn gives way to winter and the heineken cup prepares to resume centre stage meantime  the joy of six will keep the home fires burning until february.,novemb rememb last saturday

424,1897,turkey turns on the economic charm three years after a gruelling economic crisis  turkey has dressed its economy to impress.  as part of a charm offensive - ahead of 17 december  when the european union will decide whether to start entry talks - turkey s economic leaders have been banging the drum to draw attention to recent achievements. the economy is growing fast  they insist. education levels among its young and large population are rising. unemployment levels  in percentage terms  are heading fast towards single digits. inflation is under control. a new law to govern its turbulent banking system is on the cards. the tourism industry is booming and revenues from visitors should more than double to $21bn (£10.8bn) in three years.  moreover  government spending is set to be frozen and a burdensome social security deficit is being tackled. income and corporate taxes will be cut next year in order to attract $15bn of foreign investment over the next three years. a loan restructuring deal with the international monetary fund (imf) is pretty much in the can. and following recent macroeconomic restructuring efforts  its currency is floating freely and its central bank is independent.  the point of all this has been to convince europe s decision makers that rather than being a phenomenally costly exercise for the eu  allowing turkey in would in fact bring masses of economic benefits.   the cake will be bigger for everybody   said deputy prime minister abdullatif sener earlier this month.  turkey will not be a burden for the eu budget.  if admitted into the eu  turkey would contribute almost 6bn euros ($8bn; £6bn) to its budget by 2014  according to a recent impact study by the country s state planning organisation. as turkey s gross domestic output (gdp) is set to grow by 6% per year on average  its contribution would rise from less than 5bn euros in 2014 to almost 9bn euros by 2020. turkey could also help alleviate a labour shortage in  old europe  once its population comes of age. by 2014  one in four turks - or about 18 million people - will be aged 14 or less.  a literate and qualified turkish population   insisted mr sener   will make a positive impact on the eu.   this runs contrary to the popular view that turkey is getting ready to dig deep into eu taxpayers  wallets. however  turkey s assertions are confirmed by brussels  own impact studies  which indeed say that turkish membership would be good news for the eu economy. but only over time. costs are projected to be vast during the early years of turkey s membership  with subsidies alone estimated to exceed 16.5bn euros and  according to some predictions  balloon to 33.5bn euros. this would include vast agricultural subsidies and regional aid  though such payments should decline as the country s farm sector  which currently employs one in three turks  would employ just one in five by 2020.  such high initial expenses would be coupled with risks that the benefits flagged up by turkey s government would never be delivered  say those who feel the turkish project should be shunned.  some fear that rather than providing an educated  sophisticated labour force for europe at large  the people who will leave turkey to seek work abroad will be poor  uneducated - and plentiful. more recently  less palatable concerns - at least in liberal european circles - have been voiced  with senior eu or member state officials talking darkly of a  river of islam   an  oriental  culture and a threat to europe s  cultural richness . of course  many opponents are politically motivated - their views ranging from xenophobic prejudices about the country s muslim traditions to well-documented concerns about the government s human rights record. yet their economic arguments should not be dismissed out of hand.  critics insist that much of the optimism about turkey s economic roadmap has been over-egged - an argument amplified by a 134% rise in the country s current account deficit to $10.7bn during the first 10 months of this year.  the country s massive debt - which includes $23bn owed to the imf and billions borrowed via the international bond markets - also remains a major obstacle to its ambition of joining the eu.  in the new member states of the european union  gross public debt is typically about 40% of gross domestic product   says reza moghadam  assistant director of the imf s european department.  at about 80% of gdp  turkey s gross debt is double that figure.  turkey s debts have largely arisen from its efforts to push through banking reform after a run on the banks in 2001 caused the country s devastating recession.  there is no question that although turkey is doing much better than in the past  it remains quite vulnerable   says michael deppler  director of the imf s european department.  its debt is far too high for an emerging economy.  a key factor for eu decision makers should be whether or not turkey has met its economic criteria. but economics is not a science. and although the state of turkey s economy is important  as is its pace of reform  the final decision on 17 december will be taken by politicians who will  of course  be guided by their political instincts.,turkey turn econom charm three year gruell econom crisi turkey dress economi impress part charm offens ahead decemb european union decid whether start entri talk turkey econom leader bang drum draw attent recent achiev economi grow fast insist educ level among young larg popul rise unemploy level percentag term head fast toward singl digit inflat control new law govern turbul bank system card tourism industri boom revenu visitor doubl bn £bn three year moreov govern spend set frozen burdensom social secur deficit tackl incom corpor tax cut next year order attract bn foreign invest next three year loan restructur deal intern monetari fund imf pretti much follow recent macroeconom restructur effort currenc float freeli central bank independ point convinc europ decis maker rather phenomen costli exercis eu allow turkey would fact bring mass econom benefit cake big everybodi say deputi prime minist abdullatif sener earlier month turkey burden eu budget admit eu turkey would contribut almost bn euro bn £bn budget accord recent impact studi countri state plan organis turkey gross domest output gdp set grow per year averag contribut would rise less bn euro almost bn euro turkey could also help allevi labour shortag old europ popul come age one four turk million peopl age less liter qualifi turkish popul insist mr sener make posit impact eu run contrari popular view turkey get readi dig deep eu taxpay wallet howev turkey assert confirm brussel impact studi inde say turkish membership would good news eu economi time cost project vast earli year turkey membership subsidi alon estim exceed bn euro accord predict balloon bn euro would includ vast agricultur subsidi region aid though payment declin countri farm sector current employ one three turk would employ one five high initi expens would coupl risk benefit flag turkey govern would never deliv say feel turkish project shun fear rather provid educ sophist labour forc europ larg peopl leav turkey seek work abroad poor uneduc plenti recent less palat concern least liber european circl voic senior eu member state offici talk darkli river islam orient cultur threat europ cultur rich cours mani oppon polit motiv view rang xenophob prejudic countri muslim tradit welldocu concern govern human right record yet econom argument dismiss hand critic insist much optim turkey econom roadmap overeg argument amplifi rise countri current account deficit bn first month year countri massiv debt includ bn owe imf billion borrow via intern bond market also remain major obstacl ambit join eu new member state european union gross public debt typic gross domest product say reza moghadam assist director imf european depart gdp turkey gross debt doubl figur turkey debt larg arisen effort push bank reform run bank caus countri devast recess question although turkey much well past remain quit vulner say michael deppler director imf european depart debt far high emerg economi key factor eu decis maker whether turkey met econom criterion econom scienc although state turkey economi import pace reform final decis decemb take politician cours guid polit instinct

429,360,baa support ahead of court battle uk airport operator baa has reiterated its support for the government s aviation expansion plans to airports throughout the country.  the comments come a day ahead of a high court challenge by residents  groups and local councils to the government s white paper. the judicial review will centre on government plans for expansion at heathrow  stansted and luton airports. baa  which operates all three  said it was consulting with local communities.  we are...consulting on voluntary compensation schemes which go beyond our statutory obligations   a baa spokesman said.  groups challenging the plans include stop stansted expansion  heathrow anti-noise campaigners hacan clearskies and the london boroughs of hillingdon and wandsworth. at heathrow  gatwick  edinburgh and glasgow airports  baa launched a series of consultations on blight to properties from the proposed expansion in september 2004  which will close next week. the company is also offering to buy noise-hit properties for an index-linked  unblighted price. among other measures  baa has set up a homeowner support scheme for people living near stansted  and has launched a special scheme for those close to the airport but far enough away not to be covered by the homeowner scheme. at heathrow  baa said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental  air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met.  at gatwick  the company has written to homes and business likely to be affected by any extra runway. stop stansted expansion said the white paper  published in december 2003  was  fundamentally flawed  and did not follow the proper consultation process.  we do not underestimate the scale of the challenge before us because the courts have never before overturned a government white paper   said stop stansted expansion chairman peter sanders said. hacan chairman john stewart said:  almost exactly a year ago the government published its 30-year aviation white paper with much fanfare.  it hoped that would be the end of the debate and it could proceed with its plans for a massive expansion of aviation.  yet  a year later the protesters are still here  and stronger than ever.   a judgement from mr justice sullivan is expected early in february.,baa support ahead court battl uk airport oper baa reiter support govern aviat expans plan airport throughout countri comment come day ahead high court challeng resid group local council govern white paper judici review centr govern plan expans heathrow stanst luton airport baa oper three say consult local commun areconsult voluntari compens scheme go beyond statutori oblig baa spokesman say group challeng plan includ stop stanst expans heathrow antinois campaign hacan clearski london borough hillingdon wandsworth heathrow gatwick edinburgh glasgow airport baa launch seri consult blight properti propos expans septemb close next week compani also offer buy noisehit properti indexlink unblight price among measur baa set homeown support scheme peopl live near stanst launch special scheme close airport far enough away cover homeown scheme heathrow baa say work close interest parti see strict environment air qualiti nois target third runway met gatwick compani write home busi like affect extra runway stop stanst expans say white paper publish decemb fundament flaw follow proper consult process underestim scale challeng u court never overturn govern white paper say stop stanst expans chairman peter sander say hacan chairman john stewart say almost exactli year ago govern publish year aviat white paper much fanfar hope would end debat could proceed plan massiv expans aviat yet year later protest still strong ever judgement mr justic sullivan expect earli februari
430,384,brando  rejected godfather role  late film star marlon brando is said to have repeatedly turned down his oscar-winning role in the godfather.  the actor s friend budd schulberg told vanity fair magazine that brando s assistant suggested he read the novel. the actor repeatedly refused  throwing the book at her and saying:  for the last time  i won t glorify the mafia . but brando  who died last july at the age of 80  eventually took the role of don corleone  winning him an oscar in 1973 which he notoriously refused. the actor sent a young woman dressed in native american costume to refuse the award on his behalf and to draw attention to the plight of native americans.  schulberg told the magazine that brando s assistant realised the film star had warmed to the idea of the godfather role when he sported a drawn-on pencil moustache and asked:  how do i look   his assistant  alice marchak  said that he looked like george raft  an actor famed for playing gangsters on the silver screen. every time she went to see brando from then on  she added  he was wearing a different gangster-style moustache. brando was asked to screen test for the role in the godfather  as studio executives were said to be reluctant for the actor to play the part following problems on the set of brando s previous film mutiny on the bounty . in fact brando s academy award triumph revived his career. the actor was nominated for an oscar the following year for his role in bernardo bertolucci s last tango in paris. before his death  brando granted gaming company electronic arts the rights to use his voice and image in a video game based on the godfather film and book and recorded voice-overs which closely resembled his role as don corleone. brando s co-stars from the godfather  james caan and robert duvall  will also reprise their roles for the video game  it was confirmed on wednesday.,brando reject godfath role late film star marlon brando say repeatedli turn oscarwin role godfath actor friend budd schulberg told vaniti fair magazin brando assist suggest read novel actor repeatedli refus throw book say last time glorifi mafia brando die last juli age eventu take role corleon win oscar notori refus actor sent young woman dress nativ american costum refus award behalf draw attent plight nativ american schulberg told magazin brando assist realis film star warm idea godfath role sport drawnon pencil moustach ask look assist alic marchak say look like georg raft actor fame play gangster silver screen everi time go see brando ad wear differ gangsterstyl moustach brando ask screen test role godfath studio execut say reluct actor play part follow problem set brando previou film mutini bounti fact brando academi award triumph reviv career actor nomin oscar follow year role bernardo bertolucci last tango pari death brando grant game compani electron art right use voic imag video game base godfath film book record voiceov close resembl role corleon brando costar godfath jame caan robert duval also repris role video game confirm wednesday
431,1844,ministers deny care sums  wrong  ministers have insisted they are committed to free personal care for the elderly despite research suggesting the cost of the policy was under-estimated.  a report by the fraser of allander institute says the decision to push ahead with the flagship policy was based on flawed research. deputy health minister rhona brankin has pledged to study the research. snp holyrood leader nicola sturgeon said the public needed reassurance that the care programme was secure.  the rise in costs stems from a series of mistakes in the research used by the  care development group  of scottish executive experts who prepared the original costings  according to findings published in the quarterly economic commentary of strathclyde university s fraser of allander institute.  dubious  assumptions about improving health expectancy could drive the cost of the policy up by another £130m by 2022  the report warned.  it was carried out by husband and wife economist team jim and margaret cuthbert. but ms brankin told bbc radio scotland:  we don t think we got our sums wrong.  obviously we will examine the findings of this new report  along with figures from our own research that we have already commissioned.  we will look in great detail at any contribution to this  because we need to be sure we can provide free personal care and nursing care for our older people into the future.  and we are absolutely committed to doing that.   but the scottish national party called on ministers to reassure people that enough funding is in place to support the free personal care policy. ms sturgeon said that while she had no reason to doubt the executive s support for the policy  there were questions which needed to be answered and  if necessary  sums redone. she said:  serious concerns have been raised and there are questions which need to be answered by the scottish executive.  we need to know that the money is there  not just for this year or next year  but into the future so that older people  and those who are looking forward to older age  can rest assured that their personal care needs will be met.,minist deni care sum wrong minist insist commit free person care elderli despit research suggest cost polici underestim report fraser alland institut say decis push ahead flagship polici base flaw research deputi health minist rhona brankin pledg studi research snp holyrood leader nicola sturgeon say public need reassur care programm secur rise cost stem seri mistak research use care develop group scottish execut expert prepar origin cost accord find publish quarterli econom commentari strathclyd univers fraser alland institut dubiou assumpt improv health expect could drive cost polici anoth £m report warn carri husband wife economist team jim margaret cuthbert m brankin told bbc radio scotland think get sum wrong obvious examin find new report along figur research alreadi commiss look great detail contribut need sure provid free person care nurs care old peopl futur absolut commit scottish nation parti call minist reassur peopl enough fund place support free person care polici m sturgeon say reason doubt execut support polici question need answer necessari sum redon say seriou concern rais question need answer scottish execut need know money year next year futur old peopl look forward old age rest assur person care need met
432,2169,mci shareholder sues to stop bid a shareholder in us phone firm mci has taken legal action to halt a $6.75bn (£3.6bn) buyout by telecoms giant verizon  hoping to get a better deal.  the lawsuit was filed on friday after qwest communications  which had an earlier offer for mci rejected  said it would submit an improved bid. mci s directors have backed verizon  despite it tabling less money. they are accused of breaching their fiduciary duties by depriving mci shareholders  of maximum value .  according the legal papers filed in a delaware court  verizon is set to pay an   unconscionable  unfair and grossly inadequate  sum for mci  which was formerly known as worldcom. qwest said on wednesday that mci had rejected a deal worth $8bn. a number of large mci shareholders expressed unhappiness at the decision  saying that verizon s offer  made up of cash  shares and dividends  undervalued the company. friday s lawsuit argues that the verizon offer makes no provision for future growth prospects and that consolidation in the us phone industry will put a premium on mci s network  assets and clients. mci s directors have argued that verizon is bigger than qwest  has fewer debts and has built a successful mobile division. chief executive michael capellas spent last week meeting with shareholders in an effort to win their backing.  in 2002  investors in the then-named worldcom lost millions when the company filed for bankruptcy following an accounting scandal. however  the firm - now renamed mci - has put its operations in order and emerged from bankruptcy protection last april. it is a long-distance and corporate phone firm  and would provide the buyer with access to a global telecommunications network and a large number of business-based subscribers. mci shares jumped on friday  hitting their highest level since april 2004 amid speculation that it would be the focus of a bidding war. a takeover of mci would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since october as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases. earlier this month  sbc communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone pioneer at&t for about $16bn.,mci sharehold sue stop bid sharehold u phone firm mci take legal action halt bn £bn buyout telecom giant verizon hope get well deal lawsuit file friday qwest commun earlier offer mci reject say would submit improv bid mci director back verizon despit tabl less money accus breach fiduciari duti depriv mci sharehold maximum valu accord legal paper file delawar court verizon set pay unconscion unfair grossli inadequ sum mci formerli know worldcom qwest say wednesday mci reject deal worth bn number larg mci sharehold express unhappi decis say verizon offer make cash share dividend undervalu compani friday lawsuit argu verizon offer make provis futur growth prospect consolid u phone industri put premium mci network asset client mci director argu verizon big qwest few debt built success mobil divis chief execut michael capella spent last week meet sharehold effort win back investor thennam worldcom lose million compani file bankruptci follow account scandal howev firm renam mci put oper order emerg bankruptci protect last april longdist corpor phone firm would provid buyer access global telecommun network larg number businessbas subscrib mci share jump friday hit high level sinc april amid specul would focu bid war takeov mci would fifth billiondollar telecom deal sinc octob compani look cut cost boost client base earlier month sbc commun agre buy former parent phone pioneer att bn
433,1982,minister hits out at yukos sale russia s renationalisation of its energy industry needs to be reversed  a senior government figure has warned.  economy minister german gref told the kommersant newspaper that direct state involvement in oil was  unjustified . his comments follow the sale of much of oil giant yukos to cover back taxes - a deal which effectively took most of the firm s assets into public ownership. on 28 december  another senior economic adviser called the sale  the swindle of the century . yuganskneftegaz  the unit which produced 60% of yukos  output  had been seized and sold in december for less than $10bn to a previously unknown firm called baikal.  baikal promptly passed into the hands of state-controlled firm rosneft  itself shortly to merge with state gas giant gazprom.  we used to see street hustlers do this kind of thing   andrei illarionov - then economic adviser to president vladimir putin - told a press conference.  now officials are doing it.  within days  he was stripped of most of his responsibilities.  mr gref  a well-known opponent of nationalisation in competitive parts of the market  was keen to distance himself from mr iliaronov s comments. the privatisation of companies such as yukos in the 1990s had been badly handled  he said. but he stressed that the government needed to get out of oil.  i think that rosneft and yuganskneftegaz  should it become a state-owned company  must be privatized   he said.   today our government is ineffective and state companies  as a result  are for the overwhelming part ineffective as well.  and he warned that using back taxes to deal with firms like yukos - a technique now being applied by the kremlin to several other firms - was a mistake.  if we follow that logic  we should nationalise all businesses   he said. many large russian companies  particularly in the energy sector  use complex webs of offshore companies to avoid taxes.  mr gref also poured cold water on president putin s promises of doubled economic growth within a decade. the assault on yukos  assets has been widely blamed for a slowdown in economic growth in recent months.  the task is not simply to double gdp; instead it is to use gdp to qualitatively improve people s lives   mr gref told kommersant.  we don t need simply to increase gdp  but to improve its structure.  instead of focusing on headline growth figures  russia needed to focus on better institutions  such as a more efficient - and less corrupt - court system.,minist hit yuko sale russia renationalis energi industri need revers senior govern figur warn economi minist german gref told kommers newspap direct state involv oil unjustifi comment follow sale much oil giant yuko cover back tax deal effect take firm asset public ownership decemb anoth senior econom advis call sale swindl centuri yuganskneftegaz unit produc yuko output seiz sell decemb less bn previous unknown firm call baikal baikal promptli pas hand statecontrol firm rosneft shortli merg state ga giant gazprom use see street hustler kind thing andrei illarionov econom advis presid vladimir putin told press confer offici within day strip respons mr gref wellknown oppon nationalis competit part market keen distanc mr iliaronov comment privatis compani yuko s badli handl say stress govern need get oil think rosneft yuganskneftegaz becom stateown compani must privat say today govern ineffect state compani result overwhelm part ineffect well warn use back tax deal firm like yuko techniqu appli kremlin sever firm mistak follow logic nationalis busi say mani larg russian compani particularli energi sector use complex web offshor compani avoid tax mr gref also pour cold water presid putin promis doubl econom growth within decad assault yuko asset wide blame slowdown econom growth recent month task simpli doubl gdp instead use gdp qualit improv peopl live mr gref told kommers need simpli increas gdp improv structur instead focus headlin growth figur russia need focu well institut effici less corrupt court system

435,944,krispy kreme shares hit shares in krispy kreme doughnuts have taken a dunking on wall street after the firm revealed it would have to restate its 2004 financial reports.  the company warned the move would cut its profits by $3.8m to $4.9m (£2m to £2.6m) - or between 6.6% and 8.6%. krispy kreme said accounting errors had forced the move  adding that its board of directors made the decision to restate its accounts on 28 december. however  the company was unavailable to comment on why it had delayed the news.  it also warned it might have to further restate results for 2004 and 2005.  shares in krispy kreme sank 14.87% - or $1.83 - to close at $10.48 on the news. the revelation comes just a month after the firm warned earnings would be cut by as much as 7.6% as a result of accounting errors. krispy kreme said the latest adjustments involved the way it accounted for the repurchase of three franchise restaurants. it added it would now be reviewing how it accounts for its leases. in a further blow  the firm said it had been advised that some of its franchise owners were not in compliance with their loan agreements  and warned it might need to borrow extra money if it was required to honour agreements on franchisee debts or operating leases.  krispy kreme added that it had enough cash to fund its current operations  but it could not borrow any more under its existing agreements.  there are many more questions than answers  especially given increased concerns regarding company liquidity   jp morgan securities analyst john ivankoe said in a research note on the firm. the announcement is the latest blow for the one-time darling of wall street  which has lost 80% of its stock value in just over a year. the firm is currently facing securities and exchange commission investigation of its accounts. shareholders have also launched lawsuits against the group  claiming it made false statements and inflated sales.,krispi kreme share hit share krispi kreme doughnut take dunk wall street firm reveal would restat financi report compani warn move would cut profit m m £m £m krispi kreme say account error forc move ad board director make decis restat account decemb howev compani unavail comment delay news also warn might restat result share krispi kreme sank close news revel come month firm warn earn would cut much result account error krispi kreme say late adjust involv way account repurchas three franchis restaur ad would review account lea blow firm say advis franchis owner complianc loan agreement warn might need borrow extra money requir honour agreement franchise debt oper lea krispi kreme ad enough cash fund current oper could borrow exist agreement mani question answer especi give increas concern regard compani liquid jp morgan secur analyst john ivanko say research note firm announc late blow onetim darl wall street lose stock valu year firm current face secur exchang commiss investig account sharehold also launch lawsuit group claim make fals statement inflat sale

437,392,industrial revival hope for japan japanese industry is growing faster than expected  boosting hopes that the country s retreat back into recession is over.  industrial output rose 2.1% - adjusted for the time of year - in january from a month earlier. at the same time  retail sales picked up faster than at any time since 1997. the news sent tokyo shares to an eight-month high  as investors hoped for a recovery from the three quarters of contraction seen from april 2004 on. the nikkei 225 index ended the day up 0.7% at 11 740.60 points  with the yen strengthening 0.7% against the dollar to 104.53 yen. weaker exports  normally the engine for japan s economy in the face of weak domestic demand  had helped trigger a 0.1% contraction in the final three months of last year after two previous quarters of shrinking gdp. only an exceptionally strong performance in the early months of 2004 kept the year as a whole from showing a decline. the output figures brought a cautiously optimistic response from economic officials.  overall i see a low risk of the economy falling into serious recession   said bank of japan chief toshihiko fukui  despite warning that other indicators - such as the growth numbers - had been worrying.  within the overall industrial output figure  there were signs of a pullback from the export slowdown. among the best-performing sectors were key overseas sales areas such as cars  chemicals and electronic goods. with us growth doing better than expected the picture for exports in early 2005 could also be one of sustained demand. electronics were also one of the keys to the improved domestic market  with products such as flat-screen tvs in high demand during january.,industri reviv hope japan japanes industri grow faster expect boost hope countri retreat back recess industri output rise adjust time year januari month earlier time retail sale pick faster time sinc news sent tokyo share eightmonth high investor hope recoveri three quarter contract see april nikkei index end day point yen strengthen dollar yen weaker export normal engin japan economi face weak domest demand help trigger contract final three month last year two previou quarter shrink gdp except strong perform earli month kept year whole show declin output figur brought cautious optimist respons econom offici overal see low risk economi fall seriou recess say bank japan chief toshihiko fukui despit warn indic growth number worri within overal industri output figur sign pullback export slowdown among bestperform sector key oversea sale area car chemic electron good u growth well expect pictur export earli could also one sustain demand electron also one key improv domest market product flatscreen tv high demand januari

439,283,consumers  snub portable video  consumers want music rather than movies while on the move  says a report.  produced by jupiter research the analysis of the portable media player market found only 13% of europeans want to watch video while out and about. by contrast  almost a third are interested in listening to music on a portable player such as an ipod. the firm said gadget makers should avoid hybrid devices and instead make sure music reproduction was as good as possible.  the report concluded that the driving force behind the growth of europe s portable player market was likely to be music  rather than films or any combination of the two. barely 5% of those questioned said they wanted a player that could play back both music and movies. only 7% wanted a player that could handle games and video.   dedicated music players are the only established digital media players in europe today despite their high prices   said ian fogg  jupiter analyst. mr fogg said although video players and smartphones were trying to cash in on this success they faced a tough job because of the compromises that had to be made when creating a dual-purpose device.  europeans care most about music playback   he said. the report showed that 27% of consumers asked are interested in portable music players. the research revealed that french  39%  and british  31%  consumers were most interested in music players. mr fogg said portable video players were likely to remain a niche product that would not be able to compete with devices dedicated to music playback.  a separate report by jupiter forecasts that the european digital music market will grow to 836m euros (£581m) by 2009. at the end of 2003  the market was worth 10.6m euros (£7.36m). digital music players will be behind this market growth said jupiter . apple s ipod was launched in october 2001  but the portable music player market has been growing steadily since the launch of the creative nomad jukebox in mid-2000. now consumers face an almost overwhelming choice of high-capacity portable music players that let them store every track on every cd that they own.,consum snub portabl video consum want music rather movi move say report produc jupit research analysi portabl medium player market found european want watch video contrast almost third interest listen music portabl player ipod firm say gadget maker avoid hybrid devic instead make sure music reproduct good possibl report conclud drive forc behind growth europ portabl player market like music rather film combin two bare question say want player could play back music movi want player could handl game video dedic music player establish digit medium player europ today despit high price say ian fogg jupit analyst mr fogg say although video player smartphon tri cash success face tough job compromis make creat dualpurpos devic european care music playback say report show consum ask interest portabl music player research reveal french british consum interest music player mr fogg say portabl video player like remain nich product would abl compet devic dedic music playback separ report jupit forecast european digit music market grow m euro £m end market worth m euro £m digit music player behind market growth say jupit appl ipod launch octob portabl music player market grow steadili sinc launch creativ nomad jukebox mid consum face almost overwhelm choic highcapac portabl music player let store everi track everi cd
440,2220,beijingers fume over parking fees choking traffic jams in beijing are prompting officials to look at reorganising car parking charges.  car ownership has risen fast in recent years  and there are now two and a half million cars on the city s roads. the trouble is that the high status of car ownership is matched by expensive fees at indoor car parks  making motorists reluctant to use them. instead roads are being clogged by drivers circling in search of a cheaper outdoor option.  the price differences between indoor and outdoor lots are unreasonable   said wang yan  an official from the beijing municipal commission for development and reform quoted in the state-run china daily newspaper. mr wang  who is in charge of collecting car parking fees  said his team would be looking at adjusting parking prices to close the gap. indoor parking bays can cost up to 250% more than outdoor ones.  sports fans who drive to matches may also find themselves the target of the commission s road rage. it wants them to use public transport  and is considering jacking up the prices of car parks near sports grounds. mr wang said his review team may scrap the relatively cheap hourly fee near such places and impose a higher flat rate during matches. indoor parking may be costly  but it is not always secure. mr wang s team are also going to look into complaints from residents about poor service received in exchange for compulsory monthly fees of up to 400 yuan ($48; £26). the beijing authorities decided two years ago that visiting foreign dignitaries  motorcades should not longer get motorcycle outriders as they blocked the traffic. unclogging beijing s increasingly impassable streets is a major concern for the chinese authorities  who are building dozens of new roads to create a showcase modern city ahead of the 2008 olympic games.,beijing fume park fee choke traffic jam beij prompt offici look reorganis car park charg car ownership risen fast recent year two half million car citi road troubl high statu car ownership match expens fee indoor car park make motorist reluct use instead road clog driver circl search cheaper outdoor option price differ indoor outdoor lot unreason say wang yan offici beij municip commiss develop reform quot staterun china daili newspap mr wang charg collect car park fee say team would look adjust park price close gap indoor park bay cost outdoor one sport fan drive match may also find target commiss road rage want use public transport consid jack price car park near sport ground mr wang say review team may scrap rel cheap hourli fee near place impos high flat rate match indoor park may costli alway secur mr wang team also go look complaint resid poor servic receiv exchang compulsori monthli fee yuan £ beij author decid two year ago visit foreign dignitari motorcad longer get motorcycl outrid block traffic unclog beij increasingli impass street major concern chine author build dozen new road creat showcas modern citi ahead olymp game
441,1244,bridge could miss rest of season chelsea left-back wayne bridge could miss the rest of the season with a suspected broken ankle.  the england international  24  was hurt in an innocuous challenge with alan shearer during the londoners  fa cup defeat at newcastle on sunday.  we think it s a big injury   said jose mourinho  whose chelsea team this week meet barcelona in the champions league and liverpool in the carling cup final. william gallas and damien duff could also miss the barcelona game. france defender gallas and ireland winger duff both picked up their injuries in the closing stages of chelsea s 1-0 defeat at st james  park.  with bridge having gone off after mourinho used all three substitutes  those knocks plus carlo cudicini s red card meant chelsea finished the game with seven able-bodied players. cudicini would not have played against barcelona  but had been promised a game in the carling cup final  although he will now miss the cardiff showpiece through suspension. the manager is not planning to add any new names to his squad ahead of the trip to barcelona  even though he has few options to replace bridge at left-back.  celestine babayaro left the club in january  ironically to join newcastle  and although gallas has deputised at left-back before  he is struggling to be fit himself. it could be that paulo ferreira  usually a right-back  is switched to left-back with glen johnson  who ended the newcastle game in goal  playing on the right. youngsters ben hudell  joe keenan and sam tillen would be options should mourinho decide to call up a replacement  but it is unlikely he would risk an untried prospect in a champions league tie. bridge s injury also means mourinho  who reportedly wants to sign ashley cole from arsenal  will not have a specialist  senior left-back for the run-in to the season.   he (bridge) has no chance of playing against barcelona  probably will not play against liverpool (in the carling cup final) and maybe not for the rest of the season   he said.  the medical department will try to do everything to recover gallas and duff. we will have to wait and see  but i won t cry about injuries because we will have 11 players to play on tuesday.  shearer said he was unsure what caused bridge s injury.  i don t know what happened.  he said.  it was just a shame. i don t think we even touched each other.  by all accounts it s pretty serious. i went into the dressing-room after the game and wished him all the best.  mourinho  whose team are chasing three trophies  has already lost winger arjen robben to a serious injury.,bridg could miss rest season chelsea leftback wayn bridg could miss rest season suspect broken ankl england intern hurt innocu challeng alan shearer london fa cup defeat newcastl sunday think big injuri say jose mourinho whose chelsea team week meet barcelona champion leagu liverpool carl cup final william galla damien duff could also miss barcelona game franc defend galla ireland winger duff pick injuri close stage chelsea defeat st jame park bridg go mourinho use three substitut knock plu carlo cudicini red card meant chelsea finish game seven ablebodi player cudicini would play barcelona promis game carl cup final although miss cardiff showpiec suspens manag plan add new name squad ahead trip barcelona even though option replac bridg leftback celestin babayaro left club januari iron join newcastl although galla deputis leftback struggl fit could paulo ferreira usual rightback switch leftback glen johnson end newcastl game goal play right youngster ben hudel joe keenan sam tillen would option mourinho decid call replac unlik would risk untri prospect champion leagu tie bridg injuri also mean mourinho reportedli want sign ashley cole arsen specialist senior leftback runin season bridg chanc play barcelona probabl play liverpool carl cup final mayb rest season say medic depart tri everyth recov galla duff wait see cri injuri player play tuesday shearer say unsur caus bridg injuri know happen say shame think even touch account pretti seriou go dressingroom game wish best mourinho whose team chase three trophi alreadi lose winger arjen robben seriou injuri
442,648,straw backs ending china embargo uk foreign secretary jack straw has defended plans to end the european union s arms embargo on china  despite opposition from the us and japan.  mr straw  visiting beijing  noted arms embargoes applied to china  burma and zimbabwe but not to north korea  which he said had a terrible rights record. the eu imposed its arms ban on china in 1989 after troops opened fire on protestors in tiananmen square. mr straw also signed a deal on china-uk tourism. it is expected this would increase the number of chinese tourists by 40 000 per year  providing $120m in revenue. china has in the past said it sees the weapons ban as politically driven  and does not want it lifted in order to buy more weapons. mr straw  speaking at a joint news conference with chinese foreign minister li zhaoxing  stressed this point.  the result of any decision [to lift the arms embargo] should not be an increase in arms exports from european union member states to china  either in quantitative or qualitative terms   mr straw said. earlier this week he said he expected the embargo to be lifted within six months.  but mr straw faces tough opposition to the move. tory foreign affairs spokesman michael ancram said lifting the arms embargo would be  irresponsible  and would damage britain s relations with the us. he said mr straw was  naive beyond belief  if he accepted china s claim it does not want the ban lifted in order to buy weapons. the french want the embargo lifted because they want to sell arms to china; the chinese want it lifted because they want to buy arms and battlefield technology from europe.  when he was in tokyo earlier this week  japanese foreign minister nobutaka machimura told the british minister that his plan to remove the embargo was   a worrying issue that concerns the security and environment of not only japan  but also east asia overall . washington argues that if the embargo is lifted  it could lead to a buying spree for arms that china could use to threaten its diplomatic rival taiwan. beijing says taiwan is part of chinese territory and wants to unite it with the mainland  by force if necessary. the us is bound by law to help taiwan defend itself. washington has also voiced concern that the human rights conditions in china have not improved enough to merit an end to the embargo. it is an issue raised by human rights groups too. brad adams  from the uk s human rights watch  said:  this is a huge political signal from europe that they are willing to forget about tiananmen square.  but mr straw insisted the eu s code of conduct on arms exports meant tough criteria on human rights still had to be met if the embargo was lifted.,straw back end china embargo uk foreign secretari jack straw defend plan end european union arm embargo china despit opposit u japan mr straw visit beij note arm embargo appli china burma zimbabw north korea say terribl right record eu impos arm ban china troop open fire protestor tiananmen squar mr straw also sign deal chinauk tourism expect would increas number chine tourist per year provid m revenu china past say see weapon ban polit driven want lift order buy weapon mr straw speak joint news confer chine foreign minist li zhaox stress point result decis lift arm embargo increas arm export european union member state china either quantit qualit term mr straw say earlier week say expect embargo lift within six month mr straw face tough opposit move torus foreign affair spokesman michael ancram say lift arm embargo would irrespons would damag britain relat u say mr straw naiv beyond belief accept china claim want ban lift order buy weapon french want embargo lift want sell arm china chine want lift want buy arm battlefield technolog europ tokyo earlier week japanes foreign minist nobutaka machimura told british minist plan remov embargo worri issu concern secur environ japan also east asia overal washington argu embargo lift could lead buy spree arm china could use threaten diplomat rival taiwan beij say taiwan part chine territori want unit mainland forc necessari u bound law help taiwan defend washington also voic concern human right condit china improv enough merit end embargo issu rais human right group brad adam uk human right watch say huge polit signal europ will forget tiananmen squar mr straw insist eu code conduct arm export meant tough criterion human right still met embargo lift

446,1289,howard unveils election platform the conservatives would stand up for the  forgotten majority   michael howard pledged as he unveiled the first part of the tory election manifesto.  the tory leader argued there was a mass of people whom he says feel let down by tony blair and who share tory values. in the foreword to the manifesto  he promises to focus on restoring order  trying to lower taxes and giving power back to the people. labour says the document offers only a return to a  failed tory past . the liberal democrats say the conservatives cannot win what they predict will be a three-party contest.  campaigning activity is accelerating ahead of the general election  which is widely tipped for may but could be any time before june 2006. labour on monday postponed a launch of election posters because of the asian tsunami disaster. mr howard published the introduction to the tory manifesto. other chapters will follow in coming weeks.  in a speech in northamptonshire  he said the  forgotten majority  made up the backbone of britain. they were people who were saving for their first home or their retirement  working hard and accepting their responsibilities. he says in the manifesto foreword:  they have been forgotten  neglected and taken for granted by mr blair.   saying britain must change direction  mr howard argues government is too big and cannot continue  down the path of ever rising taxes . he promises to ensure frontline professionals  parents and patients make the key decisions rather than whitehall  bureaucrats . and he says the tories would get a grip on crime  immigration and disorder.  the decline of responsibility and the proliferation of so-called  human rights  have left us in a moral quagmire  unable to get a grip on rising crime and disorder   he says.  mr howard says he will produce a timetable for action so people can hold him to account but on issues like taxation he has so far only published options  not specific plans. mr howard told bbc news:  i m determined to lower taxes but i m also determined not to make any promises i can t keep.  the tories were unveiling material months ahead of the expected election because they needed time to make voters aware of their policies  he said. he was asked if tory support for the government on iraq and identity cards had given the lib dems the chance to portray themselves as the opposition to labour. mr howard argued the only test for his policies was whether they were best for britain. it had nothing to do with putting  clear blue water  between himself and his opponents.  labour s election slogan will be:  britain s working  don t let the tories wreck it again . campaign coordinator alan milburn accused the tories of  launching thatcherism in instalments  while labour helped the hard working majority of families. lib dem president simon hughes said his party had set out its election stance in september.  the liberal democrats will ask the british people for support this year as the party with the policies best able to deliver freedom and fairness and to restore trust   he said.,howard unveil elect platform conserv would stand forgotten major michael howard pledg unveil first part torus elect manifesto torus leader argu mass peopl say feel let toni blair share torus valu foreword manifesto promis focu restor order tri low tax give power back peopl labour say document offer return fail torus past liber democrat say conserv win predict threeparti contest campaign activ acceler ahead gener elect wide tip may could time june labour monday postpon launch elect poster asian tsunami disast mr howard publish introduct torus manifesto chapter follow come week speech northamptonshir say forgotten major make backbon britain peopl save first home retir work hard accept respons say manifesto foreword forgotten neglect take grant mr blair say britain must chang direct mr howard argu govern big continu path ever rise tax promis ensur frontlin profession parent patient make key decis rather whitehal bureaucrat say torus would get grip crime immigr disord declin respons prolifer socal human right left u moral quagmir unabl get grip rise crime disord say mr howard say produc timet action peopl hold account issu like taxat far publish option specif plan mr howard told bbc news determin low tax also determin make promis keep torus unveil materi month ahead expect elect need time make voter awar polici say ask torus support govern iraq ident card give lib dem chanc portray opposit labour mr howard argu test polici whether best britain noth put clear blue water oppon labour elect slogan britain work let torus wreck campaign coordin alan milburn accus torus launch thatcher instal labour help hard work major famili lib dem presid simon hugh say parti set elect stanc septemb liber democrat ask british peopl support year parti polici best abl deliv freedom fair restor trust say
447,1939,labour seeks to quell feud talk labour s leadership put on a show of unity at a campaign poster launch after mps criticised tony blair and gordon brown over reports of their rift.  mr brown was joined at the launch by john prescott and alan milburn  the man controversially put in charge of election planning by mr blair. a private meeting on monday saw normally loyal mps warn that feuding could jeopardise their election hopes. it follows a new book charting disputes between prime minister and chancellor.  the event was the first time mr milburn has shared a platform with the chancellor since taking mr brown s traditional poll planning role. but the pair chatted amicably and mr brown insisted he was happy with his current campaign task. asked about how he would deal with claims that he did not trust the prime minister  mr brown replied:  you can see that our record on the economy is about the british people trusting us to run the economy.   he refused to comment on the new book  saying nobody should be distracted from the business of government. mr brown later told reporters:  of course i trust the prime minister.  downing street cited that comment when reporters  suggested mr brown had pointedly failed to deny claims he had once told mr blair:  there is nothing you could ever say to me now that i could ever believe . labour s new posters say britain is enjoying the lowest inflation since the 1960s  lowest unemployment for 29 years and the lowest mortgage rates for 40 years. they urge voters not to let the tories take things backwards. mr milburn promised a poll campaign  which is upbeat  confident and above all else optimistic about the future of our country .  conservative co-chairman liam fox derided the photo call  saying:  the show of unity was the worst acting i have seen since prisoner cell block h.  labour had broken promises by raising taxes 66 times and brought the slowest economic growth in the english-speaking world  he said.  the prime minister and chancellor faced backbench discontent at monday s meeting of the parliamentary labour party over claims made in journalist robert peston s new book. mr blair told mps and peers:  i know from everyone here  in cabinet and government  nothing is going to get in the way of a unified labour party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need.  labour s paul flynn said the pair had had a  scorching  from mps.  on tuesday  deputy prime minister mr prescott told bbc news:  they told us very clearly  it was the troops telling the leaders: get in line.  the new book claims mr prescott hosted a dinner in november 2003 where the prime minister told mr brown he would stand down before the next election because he had lost trust over the iraq war. mr blair then changed his mind in june 2004  after cabinet allies intervened and amid suspicion the chancellor was manoeuvring against him  writes mr peston. mr prescott said there was a dinner but the discussions were confidential.  of course as a waiter for 10 years i have a professional ability here   he joked.,labour seek quell feud talk labour leadership put show uniti campaign poster launch mp

448,1366,j&j agrees $25bn guidant deal pharmaceutical giant johnson & johnson has agreed to buy medical technology firm guidant for $25.4bn (£13bn).  guidant is a key producer of equipment that combats heart problems such as implant defibrillators and pacemakers. analysts said that the deal is aimed at offsetting johnson & johnson s reliance on a slowing drug business. they also pointed out that more mergers are likely because the drug and healthcare industries are fragmented and are under pressure to cut costs. a number of johnson & johnson s products are facing patent expirations  while the company is also battling fierce competition from generic products. meanwhile  demand for defibrillators  which give the heart a small electric shock when an irregular heartbeat or rhythm is detected  is expected to increase  analysts said. the move by johnson & johnson has been widely expected and the firm will pay $76 for each guidant share  6% more than wednesday s closing price. analysts say that us antitrust regulators could force the firms to shed some overlapping stent operations. stents are tubes that are used to keep an artery open after it has been unblocked.,jj agre bn guidant deal pharmaceut giant johnson johnson agre buy medic technolog firm guidant bn £bn guidant key produc equip combat heart problem implant defibril pacemak analyst say deal aim offset johnson johnson relianc slow drug busi also point merger like drug healthcar industri fragment pressur cut cost number johnson johnson product face patent expir compani also battl fierc competit gener product meanwhil demand defibril give heart small electr shock irregular heartbeat rhythm detect expect increas analyst say move johnson johnson wide expect firm pay guidant share wednesday close price analyst say u antitrust regul could forc firm shed overlap stent oper stent tube use keep arteri open unblock

451,356,eu  too slow  on economic reforms most eu countries have failed to put in place policies aimed at making europe the world s most competitive economy by the end of the decade  a report says.  the study  undertaken by the european commission  sought to assess how far the eu has moved towards meeting its economic targets. in 2000  eu leaders at a summit in lisbon pledged the european economy would outstrip that of the us by 2010. their economic targets became known as the lisbon agenda. but the commission report says that  in most eu countries  the pace of economic reform has been too slow  and fulfilling the lisbon ambitions will be difficult - if not impossible.  only the uk  finland  belgium  denmark  ireland and the netherlands have actually followed up policy recommendations. among the biggest laggards  according to the report  are greece and italy. the lisbon agenda set out to increase the number of people employed in europe by encouraging more older people and women to stay in the workforce. it also set out to raise the amount the private sector spends on research and development  while bringing about greater discipline over public spending and debt levels. combined with high environmental standards and efforts to level the playing field for businesses throughout the eu  the plan was for europe to become the world s most dynamic economy by 2010. next week  the commission will present revised proposals to meet the lisbon goals. many people expect the 2010 target to be quietly dropped.,eu slow econom reform eu countri fail put place polici aim make europ world competit economi end decad report say studi undertaken european commiss sought ass far eu move toward meet econom target eu leader summit lisbon pledg european economi would outstrip u econom target becam know lisbon agenda commiss report say eu countri pace econom reform slow fulfil lisbon ambit difficult imposs uk finland belgium denmark ireland netherland actual follow polici recommend among big laggard accord report greec itali lisbon agenda set increas number peopl employ europ encourag old peopl woman stay workforc also set rais amount privat sector spend research develop bring great disciplin public spend debt level combin high environment standard effort level play field busi throughout eu plan europ becom world dynam economi next week commiss present revis propos meet lisbon goal mani peopl expect target quietli drop
452,2063,will the budget bring out smiling voters  as tory spokesman oliver letwin said - any chancellor would use his pre-election budget to offer some vote winning sweeteners  wouldn t he.  and everyone does  indeed  expect gordon brown to do just that in his last budget before the expected polling day of 5 may. there will be plenty of talk about taking no risks with the economy or handing out irresponsible giveaways. but mr brown will stun westminster and break just about every historical precedent if he fails to do something designed to put a smile on voters  faces and make them more inclined to back labour in the election. and there has already been speculation about possible tax reductions for the poorest and increasing the threshold on stamp duty in this week s budget. the aim of his package will be to keep any disillusioned core labour voters in the fold  while ensuring the middle england voters who gave tony blair two election victories don t desert him at the third poll.  and  needless to say  there will be plenty of analysis of what impact the budget will have on mr brown s own ambitions to replace mr blair as prime minister at some point after a third win. but there is a shadow hanging over this pre-election performance - in the shape of £11 billion or thereabouts. that is the size of the financial  black hole  the tories  backed by some independent forecasters  believe mr brown will have to fill with tax increases after the election.  the opening shot in that battle was fired at the weekend with claims a treasury leak suggested mr brown was ready to slap capital gains tax on home sales to raise some of that cash. it was immediately denied  but the tories remain suspicious  claiming that  as mr letwin said  if the money does not come from there  where will it come from.  mr brown will undoubtedly claim the forecasts are simply wrong and that he will have absolutely no need to raise taxes after the election  should labour win. previous gloomy forecasts proved wrong  he will argue  while suggesting that only by sticking with him can britain continue to have a sound economy  low unemployment and high public spending. the opposition will reject that by claiming they can keep the economy sound  increase spending and cut taxes at the same time.  the liberal democrats will also promise to run a sound economy  but based on increased taxes to fund spending and  amongst other things  abolishing the council tax in favour of a local income tax. and there will be prolonged argument over which of the parties can make the greatest savings in whitehall and beyond to fund their policies. but probably what that all boils down to is a simple question of which of the parties the voters most trust to keep the economy stable and avoid any unpleasant surprises in the coming years. and it is probably still the answer to that one question that will overwhelmingly decide the outcome of the general election.,budget bring smile voter torus spokesman oliv letwin say chancellor would use preelect budget offer vote win sweeten everyon inde expect gordon brown last budget expect poll day may plenti talk take risk economi hand irrespons giveaway mr brown stun westminst break everi histor preced fail someth design put smile voter face make inclin back labour elect alreadi specul possibl tax reduct poorest increas threshold stamp duti week budget aim packag keep disillus core labour voter fold ensur middl england voter give toni blair two elect victori desert third poll needle say plenti analysi impact budget mr brown ambit replac mr blair prime minist point third win shadow hang preelect perform shape £ billion thereabout size financi black hole torus back independ forecast believ mr brown fill tax increas elect open shot battl fire weekend claim treasuri leak suggest mr brown readi slap capit gain tax home sale rais cash immedi deni torus remain suspici claim mr letwin say money come come mr brown undoubtedli claim forecast simpli wrong absolut need rais tax elect labour win previou gloomi forecast prove wrong argu suggest stick britain continu sound economi low unemploy high public spend opposit reject claim keep economi sound increas spend cut tax time liber democrat also promis run sound economi base increas tax fund spend amongst thing abolish council tax favour local incom tax prolong argument parti make great save whitehal beyond fund polici probabl boil simpl question parti voter trust keep economi stabl avoid unpleas surpris come year probabl still answer one question overwhelmingli decid outcom gener elect

455,1398,parties warned over  grey vote  political parties cannot afford to take older uk voters for granted in the coming election  says age concern.  a survey for the charity suggests 69% of over-55s say they always vote in a general election compared with just 17% of 18 to 24 year olds. charity boss gordon lishman said if a  decisive blow  was struck at the election it would be by older voters who could be relied on to turn out. a total of 3 028 adults aged 18 or over were interviewed for the study. mr lishman urged the next government to boost state pension.  he also called for measures to combat ageism and build effective public services to  support us all in an ageing society .  older people want to see manifesto commitments that will make a difference to their lives   mr lishman said.  political parties must wake up to the fact that unless they address the demands and concerns of older people they will not keep or attract their vote.  in the survey carried out by icm research  14% of people aged between 18 and 34 said they never voted in general elections. among the over-65s  70% said they would be certain to vote in an immediate election  compared with 39% of people under 55. age concern says the over-55s are  united around  key areas of policy they want the government to focus on. for 57%  pensions and the nhs were key issues  while the economy was important for a third  and tax was a crucial area for 25%.  the report was welcomed by conservative shadow pensions secretary david willetts.  the pensioners  voice must certainly be heard in the next election as they have never fitted into blair s cool britannia   he said.  labour s continued refusal to admit the true extent of the pensions crisis will be one of the monumental failures of this government.  he pointed to tory plans to increase the basic state pension to reduce means testing  strengthen company pensions and encourage savings. a liberal democrat spokesman said the party took the issues raised in the report very seriously. he highlighted the party s promises to raise the basic state pension  provide free long-term care for the elderly and replace council tax  seen as a particular problem for pensioners on fixed incomes. labour has said it wants to use savings reforms to incapacity benefit to improve the basic state pension and has set up a review of the council tax system.,parti warn grey vote polit parti afford take old uk voter grant come elect say age concern survey chariti suggest over say alway vote gener elect compar year old chariti bos gordon lishman say decis blow struck elect would old voter could reli turn total adult age interview studi mr lishman urg next govern boost state pension also call measur combat ageism build effect public servic support u age societi old peopl want see manifesto commit make differ live mr lishman say polit parti must wake fact unless address demand concern old peopl keep attract vote survey carri icm research peopl age say never vote gener elect among over say would certain vote immedi elect compar peopl age concern say over unit around key area polici want govern focu pension nh key issu economi import third tax crucial area report welcom conserv shadow pension secretari david willett pension voic must certainli heard next elect never fit blair cool britannia say labour continu refus admit true extent pension crisi one monument failur govern point torus plan increas basic state pension reduc mean test strengthen compani pension encourag save liber democrat spokesman say parti take issu rais report serious highlight parti promis rais basic state pension provid free longterm care elderli replac council tax see particular problem pension fix incom labour say want use save reform incapac benefit improv basic state pension set review council tax system
456,855,q&a: malcolm glazer and man utd the battle for control of manchester united has taken another turn after the club confirmed it had received a fresh takeover approach from us business tycoon malcolm glazer.  no formal offer has been made yet  but manchester united have confirmed they have received a  detailed proposal  from the us entrepreneur which could lead to a bid. reports have put the offer at 300p per share  which would value manchester united at about £800m ($1.5bn). the approach by the 76-year-old owner of the tampa bay buccaneers american football team is reportedly being led by his two sons  avi and joel. a previous approach to the united board by mr glazer in october last year was turned down. however  the bbc has learnt that the club is unlikely to reject the latest plan out of hand.  mr glazer s previous offer involved borrowing large amounts of money to finance any takeover. that would have left the club with debt levels which were deemed  not... in the best interests of the company  by manchester united s board when they rejected his approach last year. however  mr glazer s latest offer is reported to have cut the amount of borrowing needed by £200m.  while united s board may be casting a serious eye over mr glazer s latest proposals  supporters remain fiercely opposed to any deal.  supporters  group shareholders united - which has proved adept in rallying opposition to mr glazer s campaign - said it would fight any move.  manchester united are a debt-free company. we don t want to fall into debt and we don t need to fall into debt   shareholders united s sean bones told the bbc. united s players also appear unhappy at the prospect of a takeover.  a lot of people want the club s interest to be with people who have grown up with the club and got its interests at heart   rio ferdinand told bbc radio five live.  no-one knows what this guy will be bringing to the table.   the key to any successful bid will be attracting the support of united s largest shareholders  the irish horse racing tycoons john magnier and jp mcmanus. through their cubic expression vehicle they own 28.9% of the club. mr glazer owns 28.1%. joe mclean  a football specialist at accountancy firm grant thornton  said the support of mr magnier and mr mcmanus was  utterly crucial .  mr glazer s bid will not proceed without their support and they have previously indicated that they are holding their stake as an investment.  if that s the case  the shares will therefore need a price attachment of about 300 pence  maybe 305.  if that s the case then mr glazer might well secure their support - if he does  this bid could well go ahead.   indeed it is. malcolm glazer was little-known in the uk until he started to build up his stake in manchester united in late 2003. in february 2004 he said he was  considering  whether to bid for the club. no bid emerged  but mr glazer continued to increase his holding in the club. in october 2004  manchester united said they had received a  preliminary approach   which turned out to have come from mr glazer. however  the board rejected the move because of the amount of debt it would involve. at the club s annual general meeting in november  mr glazer took revenge by using his hefty stake in the club to oust three directors from the board. legal adviser maurice watkins  commercial director andy anson and non-executive director philip yea were voted out  against the wishes of chief executive david gill. but the move led to bankers jp morgan and public relations firm brunswick withdrawing from the glazer bid team.,qa malcolm glazer man utd battl control manchest unit take anoth turn club confirm receiv fresh takeov approach u busi tycoon malcolm glazer formal offer make yet manchest unit confirm receiv detail propos u entrepreneur could lead bid report put offer p per share would valu manchest unit £m bn approach yearold owner tampa bay buccan american footbal team reportedli lead two son avi joel previou approach unit board mr glazer octob last year turn howev bbc learnt club unlik reject late plan hand mr glazer previou offer involv borrow larg amount money financ takeov would left club debt level deem best interest compani manchest unit board reject approach last year howev mr glazer late offer report cut amount borrow need £m unit board may cast seriou eye mr glazer late propos support remain fierc oppos deal support group sharehold unit prove adept ralli opposit mr glazer campaign say would fight move manchest unit debtfre compani want fall debt need fall debt sharehold unit sean bone told bbc unit player also appear unhappi prospect takeov lot peopl want club interest peopl grown club get interest heart rio ferdinand told bbc radio five live noon know guy bring tabl key success bid attract support unit large sharehold irish hors race tycoon john magnier jp mcmanu cubic express vehicl club mr glazer own joe mclean footbal specialist account firm grant thornton say support mr magnier mr mcmanu utterli crucial mr glazer bid proceed without support previous indic hold stake invest case share therefor need price attach penc mayb case mr glazer might well secur support bid could well go ahead inde malcolm glazer littleknown uk start build stake manchest unit late februari say consid whether bid club bid emerg mr glazer continu increas hold club octob manchest unit say receiv preliminari approach turn come mr glazer howev board reject move amount debt would involv club annual gener meet novemb mr glazer take reveng use hefti stake club oust three director board legal advis mauric watkin commerci director andi anson nonexecut director philip yea vote wish chief execut david gill move lead banker jp morgan public relat firm brunswick withdraw glazer bid team
457,1205,at a glance: tory health checks the uk  opposition conservatives have unveiled plans to introduce health checks for immigrants if they win the general election. here s a guide to the plan:  people coming to live and work in britain from outside the eu. if they plan to stay six months or more and are from a country with lots of tb  they would have to have a chest x-ray and further tests if appropriate. all people from outside the european union who want to stay a year or more will have to undergo a full medical.  tuberculosis  hepatitis b and hiv. a positive test for tb would automatically mean visa applications being turned down. all other conditions would be dealt with on a case by case basis.  people would have to prove they have an acceptable standard of health and are unlikely to be a danger to public health in the uk  or impose significant costs or demands on the nhs. they would also  if appropriate  have to be able to undertake the work or study they applied to come here for.  people coming to britain for less than six months would not be medically tested unless they intended to work in health care  childcare or teaching. children and pregnant women wanting to live in britain permanently would not have to have a chest x-ray for tb. under 16s would not face tests for hepatitis and hiv.  the tories say people fleeing persecution will not be denied sanctuary in britain because of poor health. however  they will undergo health checks to ensure they receive the right medical treatment and do not spread infectious diseases.  they claim government figures show that tb in england has increased by 25% over the last 10 years and that nearly two-thirds of people with the disease were born overseas. they also believe there should be stricter controls over who comes into britain to ensure they are not a public health risk. they say the plans will protect access to the nhs.  applicants will be tested in their home country. only asylum seekers will be tested in the uk once their refugee status is established.  home office minister des browne says the government already routinely checks people for tb if they come into the uk for six months or more from high-risk countries. recent medical checks were carried out on 175 000 people at heathrow airport and 10 000 at gatwick. from those tests  about 100 infectious cases of tb were found.  the tories say 47 other countries across the world impose requirements of this kind. the party has looked at the way the system is operated in australia  canada and new zealand. the tory proposals are  quite closely modelled  on the new zealand system.  labour claims the policy is little more than a  desperate attempt to catch up with labour s five-year plan  for immigration and asylum  which was published last week. this says health screening for tb will be targeted on applicants from high-risk areas before they are given entry clearance. those who are diagnosed with the disease would then need to seek treatment at home before being allowed to enter the uk. the liberal democrats have warned labour and the tories they were  in danger of pandering to prejudice rather than challenging it .,glanc torus health check uk opposit conserv unveil plan introduc health check immigr win gener elect guid plan peopl come live work britain outsid eu plan stay six month countri lot tb would chest xray test appropri peopl outsid european union want stay year undergo full medic tuberculosi hepat b hiv posit test tb would automat mean visa applic turn condit would dealt case case basi peopl would prove accept standard health unlik danger public health uk impos signific cost demand nh would also appropri abl undertak work studi appli come peopl come britain less six month would medic test unless intend work health care childcar teach child pregnant woman want live britain perman would chest xray tb s would face test hepat hiv torus say peopl flee persecut deni sanctuari britain poor health howev undergo health check ensur receiv right medic treatment spread infecti diseas claim govern figur show tb england increas last year nearli twothird peopl diseas born oversea also believ stricter control come britain ensur public health risk say plan protect access nh applic test home countri asylum seeker test uk refuge statu establish home offic minist de brown say govern alreadi routin check peopl tb come uk six month highrisk countri recent medic check carri peopl heathrow airport gatwick test infecti case tb found torus say countri across world impos requir kind parti look way system oper australia canada new zealand torus propos quit close model new zealand system labour claim polici littl desper attempt catch labour fiveyear plan immigr asylum publish last week say health screen tb target applic highrisk area give entri clearanc diagnos diseas would need seek treatment home allow enter uk liber democrat warn labour torus danger pander prejudic rather challeng
458,1739,golden economic period  to end ten years of  golden  economic performance may come to an end in 2005 with growth slowing markedly  city consultancy deloitte has warned.  the uk economy could suffer a backlash from the slowdown in the housing market  triggering a fall in consumer spending and a rise in unemployment. deloitte is forecasting economic growth of 2% this year  below chancellor gordon brown s forecast of 3% to 3.5%. it also believes that interest rates will fall to 4% by the end of the year.  in its quarterly economic review  deloitte said the uk economy had enjoyed a  golden period  during the past decade with unemployment falling to a near 30 year low and inflation at its lowest since the 1960s.  but it warned that this growth had been achieved at the expense of creating major  imbalances  in the economy. deloitte s chief economic advisor roger bootle said:  the biggest hit of all is set to come from the housing market which has already embarked on a major slowdown.  whereas the main driver of the economy in recent years has been robust household spending growth  this is likely to suffer as the housing market slowdown gathers pace.   economic growth is likely to be constrained during the next few years by increased pressure on household budgets and rising taxes  deloitte believes. gordon brown will need to raise about $10bn a year in order to sustain the public finances in the short term  the firm claims. this will result in a marked slowdown in growth in 2005 and 2006 compared to last year  when the economy expanded by 3.25%. however  deloitte stressed that the slowdown was unlikely to have any major impact on retail prices while it expected the bank of england to respond quickly to signs of the economy faltering. it expects a series of  aggressive  interest rate cuts over the next two years  with the cost of borrowing falling from its current 4.75% mark to 3.5% by the end of 2006.  although 2005 may not be the year when things go completely wrong  it will probably mark the start of a more difficult period for the uk economy   mr bootle.,golden econom period end ten year golden econom perform may come end growth slow markedli citi consult deloitt warn uk economi could suffer backlash slowdown hous market trigger fall consum spend rise unemploy deloitt forecast econom growth year chancellor gordon brown forecast also believ interest rate fall end year quarterli econom review deloitt say uk economi enjoy golden period past decad unemploy fall near year low inflat low sinc s warn growth achiev expens creat major imbal economi deloitt chief econom advisor roger bootl say big hit set come hous market alreadi embark major slowdown wherea main driver economi recent year robust household spend growth like suffer hous market slowdown gather pace econom growth like constrain next year increas pressur household budget rise tax deloitt believ gordon brown need rais bn year order sustain public financ short term firm claim result mark slowdown growth compar last year economi expand howev deloitt stress slowdown unlik major impact retail price expect bank england respond quickli sign economi falter expect seri aggress interest rate cut next two year cost borrow fall current mark end although may year thing go complet wrong probabl mark start difficult period uk economi mr bootl

464,1880,file-swappers ready new network legal attacks on websites that help people swap pirated films have forced the development of a system that could be harder to shut down.  one site behind the success of the bittorrent file-swapping system is producing its own software that avoids the pitfalls of the earlier program. a test version of the new exeem program will be released in late january. but doubts remain about the new networks ability to ensure files being swapped are  quality copies .  in late december movie studios launched a legal campaign against websites that helped people swap pirated movies using the bittorrent network. the legal campaign worked because of the way that bittorrent is organised. that file-sharing system relies on links called  trackers  that point users to others happy to share the file they are looking for. shutting down sites that listed trackers crippled the bittorrent network. one of the sites shut down by the legal campaign was suprnova.org which helped boost the popularity of the bittorrent system by checking that trackers led to the movies or tv programmes they claimed to.  now the man behind suprnova.org  who goes by the nickname sloncek  is preparing to release software for a new file-swapping network dubbed exeem. in an interview with novastream web radio  sloncek said exeem would combine ideas from the bittorrent and kazaa file-sharing systems. like bittorrent  exeem will have trackers that help point people toward the file they want. like kazaa these trackers will be held by everyone. there will be no centrally maintained list. this  said sloncek  should make the system less vulnerable to legal action aimed at stopping people swapping pirated movies and music. the exeem software has been under development for a few months and is currently being tested by a closed group of users. an early public version of the software should be available before february. sloncek said that currently only a windows version of the software was in development. there were no plans for a linux or mac version. he said that costs of writing the software will be paid for by adverts appearing in the finished version of the program. despite suprnova administrator sloncek s involvement with exeem  the basic technology appears to have been developed by a firm called swarm systems that is based on caribbean island saint kitts and nevis.  users of the exeem system will be able to rate files being swapped to help stop the spread of fake files  sloncek told novastream.  dr johan pouwelse  a researcher at the delft university of technology who studies peer-to-peer networks  said exeem was the next evolution in file-sharing systems. but  he said  it would struggle to be as popular as bittorrent and suprnova because early versions were not taking enough care to make sure good copies of files were being shared.  exeem cannot prevent pollution   he said.  the rating system in exeem seems flawed because it is easy to insert both fake files and fake ratings   he said. studies have shown that organisations working for record labels and movie studios have worked to undermine kazaa by putting in fakes. by contrast moderators on suprnova made sure files being shared were high quality.  the moderators are the difference between having a system that works and one that s full of crap like kazaa   he said.  there is a fundamental tension between distribution and integrity   he said. mr pouwelse said that future versions of file-sharing systems are likely to incorporate some kind of distributed reputation system that lets moderators prove who they are to the network and rate which files are worth downloading. when big files were being shared moderation systems were key  said mr pouwelse. he added that the legal attacks on bittorrent had driven people away from sites such as suprnova but many users had simply migrated to other tracker listing sites many of which have seen huge increases in traffic.  it s hard to compete with free   he said. no-one from the motion picture association of america was immediately available for comment on the file-sharing development.,fileswapp readi new network legal

467,1052,uk helps raped rwandan women britain is to give a £4m grant to help women survivors of the rwandan genocide who were raped and often deliberately infected with hiv/aids.  an estimated 25 000 girls and women were raped during the 1994 genocide. about 800 000 tutsis and moderate hutus were killed by hutu militias after the assassination of an ethnic hutu leader. the five-year department for international development funding will enable more survivors to have access to anti-retroviral treatment.  the plight of the infected women was overshadowed for a long time. it was overshadowed by rwanda s emergence from the 100 days of slaughter  during which time the mass killings took place  and the women s fate was largely a taboo subject. but many of the women were widowed and they now not only have their own children to care for but  in many cases  orphans too.  as the women die  the number of rwanda s orphans rises. until recently  very few of the women have had access to anti-retroviral treatment. that is now starting to change. this funding is intended to make anti-retrovirals and other care available for some 2 500 women. mary kayitesi blewitt  founder of the survivors fund (surf)  one of the organisations through which the funds are being channelled  said it was a recognition  before it was too late  that the survivors should be a priority for help.,uk help rape rwandan woman britain give £m grant help woman survivor rwandan genocid rape often deliber infect hivaid estim girl woman rape genocid tutsi moder hutu kill hutu militia assassin ethnic hutu leader fiveyear depart intern develop fund enabl survivor access antiretrovir treatment plight infect woman overshadow long time overshadow rwanda emerg day slaughter time mass kill take place woman fate larg taboo subject mani woman widow child care mani case orphan woman die number rwanda orphan rise recent woman access antiretrovir treatment start chang fund intend make antiretrovir care avail woman mari kayitesi blewitt founder survivor fund surf one organis fund channel say recognit late survivor prioriti help
468,433,england 17-18 france england suffered an eighth defeat in 11 tests as scrum-half dimitri yachvili booted france to victory at twickenham.  two converted tries from olly barkley and josh lewsey helped the world champions to a 17-6 half-time lead. but charlie hodgson and barkley missed six penalties between them  while yachvili landed six for france to put the visitors in front. england could have won the game with three minutes left  but hodgson pushed an easy drop goal opportunity wide. it was a dismal defeat for england  coming hard on the heels of an opening six nations loss in wales. they should have put the game well beyond france s reach  but remarkably remained scoreless for the entire second half. a scrappy opening quarter saw both sides betray the lack of confidence engendered by poor opening displays against wales and scotland respectively. hodgson had an early opportunity to settle english nerves but pushed a straightforward penalty attempt wide. but a probing kick from france centre damien traille saw mark cueto penalised for holding on to the ball in the tackle  yachvili giving france the lead with a kick from wide out.  france twice turned over england ball at the breakdown early on as the home side struggled to generate forward momentum  one ben kay charge apart. a spell of tit-for-tat kicking emphasised the caution on both sides  until england refused a possible three points to kick a penalty to the corner  only to botch the subsequent line-out. but england made the breakthrough after 19 minutes  when a faltering move off the back of a scrum led to the opening try. jamie noon took a short pass from barkley and ran a good angle to plough through yann delaigue s flimsy tackle before sending his centre partner through to score at the posts.  hodgson converted and added a penalty after one of several french infringements on the floor for a 10-3 lead. the fly-half failed to dispense punishment though with a scuffed attempt after france full-back pepito elhorga  scragged by lewsey  threw the ball into touch. barkley also missed two longer-range efforts as the first half drew to a close  but by then england had scored a second converted try. after a series of phases lock danny grewcock ran hard at the french defence and off-loaded out of sylvain marconnet s tackle to lewsey. the industrious wing cut back in on an angle and handed off hooker sebastien bruno to sprint over. after a dire opening to the second half  france threw on three forward replacements in an attempt to rectify the situation  wing jimmy marlu having already departed injured. yachvili nibbled away at the lead with a third penalty after 51 minutes.  and when lewis moody was twice penalised - for handling in a ruck and then straying offside - the scrum-half s unerring left boot cut the deficit to two points. barkley then missed his third long-range effort to increase the tension. and after seeing another attempt drop just short  yachvili put france ahead with his sixth penalty with 11 minutes left.  england sent on ben cohen and matt dawson  and after barkley s kick saw christophe dominici take the ball over his own line  the stage was set for a victory platform. but even after a poor scrummage  hodgson had the chance to seal victory but pushed his drop-goal attempt wide. england threw everything at the french in the final frantic moments  but the visitors held on for their first win at twickenham since 1997.  j robinson (capt);

469,248,steady job growth continues in us the us created fewer jobs than expected in december  but analysts said that the dip in hiring was not enough to derail the world s biggest economy.  according to labor department figures  157 000 new jobs were added last month. that took 2004 s total to 2.2 million  the best showing in five years. job creation was one of last year s main concerns for the us economy. while worries still remain  the conditions are set for steady growth in 2005  analysts said. the unemployment rate stayed at 5.4% in december  and about 200 000 jobs will need to be created each month if that figure is to drop.   it was a respectable report   said michael moran  analyst at daiwa securities.   payroll growth in december was a little lighter than the consensus forecast  but we had upward revisions to the prior two months and an increase in manufacturing employment.   manufacturing is a cyclical area of the economy and if it s showing job growth  it s a good indication that the economy is on a solid growth track.  that means that the federal reserve is likely to continue its policy of raising interest rates. the fed lifted borrowing costs five times last year to 2.25%  citing evidence the us economic recovery was becoming more robust.  job creation was one of last year s main concerns for the us economy  and proved to be a main topic of debate in the us presidential election. while demand for workers is far from booming  the conditions are set for steady growth.  overall  compared to the previous year it looks great  it just keeps going stronger and stronger and i expect that to be the case  in 2005  said kurt karl  economist at swiss re in new york. meanwhile  economists cautioned against reading too much into data from the federal reserve showing an unexpected $8.7bn drop in consumer debt in november. a fall in consumer spending  which makes up about two-thirds of all us economic activity  could help limit the extent of any future interest rate rises. but economists said there could be a number of reasons for a fall in the borrowing  which include credit cards and personal loans  while noting that such figures can vary on a month-to-month basis.,steadi job growth continu u u creat few job expect decemb analyst say dip hire enough derail world big economi accord labor depart figur new job ad last month take total million best show five year job creation one last year main concern u economi worri still remain condit set steadi growth analyst say unemploy rate stay decemb job need creat month figur drop respect report say michael moran analyst daiwa secur payrol growth decemb littl lighter consensu forecast upward revis prior two month increas manufactur employ manufactur cyclic area economi show job growth good indic economi solid growth track mean feder reserv like continu polici rais interest rate fed lift borrow cost five time last year cite evid u econom recoveri becom robust job creation one last year main concern u economi prove main topic debat u presidenti elect demand worker far boom condit set steadi growth overal compar previou year look great keep go strong strong expect case say kurt karl economist swiss new york meanwhil economist caution read much data feder reserv show unexpect bn drop consum debt novemb fall consum spend make twothird u econom activ could help limit extent futur interest rate rise economist say could number reason fall borrow includ credit card person loan note figur vari monthtomonth basi
470,240,concerns over windows atms cash machine networks could soon be more susceptible to computer viruses  a security firm has warned.  the warning is being issued because many banks are starting to use the windows operating system in machines. already there have been four incidents in which windows viruses have disrupted networks of cash machines running the microsoft operating system. but banking experts say the danger is being overplayed and that the risks of infection and disruption are small.  for many years the venerable ibm operating system  known as os/2  has been the staple software used to power many of the 1.4m cash machines in operation around the world. but ibm will end support for os/2 in 2006 which is forcing banks to look for alternatives. there are also other pressures making banks turn to windows said dominic hirsch  managing director of financial analysis firm retail banking research.  he said many cash machines will also have to be upgraded to make full use of the new europay  mastercard and visa credit cards that use computer chips instead of magnetic stripes to store data. us laws that demand disabled people get equal access to information will also force banks to make their cash machines more versatile and able to present information in different ways. todd thiemann  spokesman for anti-virus firm trend micro  said the move to windows in cash machines was not without risks. mr thiemann said research by the towergroup showed that 70% of new cash machines being installed were windows based.  already  he said  there have been four incidents in which cash machines have been unavailable for hours due to viruses affecting the network of the bank that owns them.  in january 2003 the slammer worm knocked out 13 000 cash machines of the bank of america and many of those operated by the canadian imperial bank of commerce. in august of the same year  cash machines of two un-named banks were put out of action for hours following an infection by the welchia worm. incidents like this happen  said mr thiemann  because when banks start using windows cash machines they also change the networking technology used to link the devices to their back office computers. this often means that all the cash machines and computers in a bank share the same data network.  this could mean that cash machines get caught up in the viruses that are going around because they have a common transmission system   he said.  banks need to consider protection as part of the investment to maintain the security of that network   mr thiemann told bbc news online.  but mr hirsch from retail banking research said the number of cash machines actually at risk was low because so few were upgraded every year.  currently  he said  a cash machine has a lifetime of up to 10 years which means that only about 10% of all atms get swapped for a newer model every year.  windows cash machines have been around for several years   he said.  most banks simply upgrade as part of their usual replacement cycle.   in theory there is a bigger threat with windows than os/2   he said   but i do not think that the banks are hugely concerned at the moment.   it s pretty unusual to hear about virus problems with atms   he said. the many different security systems built-in to cash machines meant there was no chance that a virus could cause them to start spitting out cash spontaneously  he said. banks were more likely to be worried about internal networks being overwhelmed by worms and viruses and customers not being able to get cash out at all  he added. a spokesman for the association of payment and clearing services (apacs) which represents the uk s payments industry said the risk from viruses was minimal.  there s no concern that there s going to be any type of virus hitting the uk networks   he said. risks of infection were small because the data networks that connect uk cash machines together and the operators of the atms themselves were a much smaller and tightly-knit community than in the us where viruses have struck.,concern window atm cash machin network could soon suscept comput virus secur firm warn warn issu mani bank start use window

471,364,nortel in $300m profit revision telecoms equipment maker nortel networks has sharply revised downwards its profits for the 2003 fiscal year.  in a long-awaited filing  nortel said it had made $434m (£231m)  compared to the previously reported $732m. but the figures - revised after an audit which led to the sacking of the canadian firm s chief - showed revenue was about 4% higher than first thought. nortel shares  which have lost nearly 50% of their value since last year  climbed 1.46% in toronto on tuesday. nortel s head frank dunn and two other executives were fired in january last year after the company announced it had conducted the internal audit. securities and police authorities in both the us and canada are still conducting inquiries into the accounts.  nortel also issued new figures for the 2001-2002 period  which they had previously indicated had understated losses.  with the completion of our restatements we have a solid foundation on which to move forward with our business   said nortel president and chief executive bill owens.  the restatement has been a monumental task  both complex and demanding.  the company also said 12 senior executives - none of whom were involved directly in the accounting of the revised figures - have voluntarily agreed to repay to bonuses awarded in 2003 totalling $8.6m. nortel added:  these members of the core executive team share the board s deep disappointment over the circumstances that led to the restatement.,nortel m profit revis telecom equip maker nortel network sharpli revis downward profit fiscal year longawait file nortel say make m £m compar previous report m figur revis audit lead sack canadian firm chief show revenu high first thought nortel share lose nearli valu sinc last year climb toronto tuesday nortel head frank dunn two execut fire januari last year compani announc conduct intern audit secur polic author u canada still conduct inquiri account nortel also issu new figur period previous indic underst loss complet restat solid foundat move forward busi say nortel presid chief execut bill owen restat monument task complex demand compani also say senior execut none involv directli account revis figur voluntarili agre repay bonus award total m nortel ad member core execut team share board deep disappoint circumst lead restat
472,1928,nadal puts spain 2-0 up result: nadal 6-7 (6/8) 6-2 7-6 (8/6) 6-2 roddick  spain s rafael nadal beats andy roddick of the usa in the second singles match rubber of the 2004 davis cup final in seville. spain lead 1-0 after carlos moya beat mardy fish in straight sets in the opening match of the tie.  nadal holds his nerve and the crowd goes wild as spain go 2-0 up in the tie.  roddick holds serve to force nadal to serve for the match but the american surely cannot turn things around now.  nadal works roddick around the court on two consecutive points to earn two break points. one is enough  the spaniard secures the double-break and roddick is now teetering on the edge.  roddick is trying to gee himself up but the clay surface is taking its toll on his game and he is looking tired. nadal wins the game to love.  nadal steps up the pressure to break and spain have the early initiative in the fourth set.  nadal also holds convincingly as both players feel their way into the fourth set.  roddick shrugs off the disappointment of losing the third-set tiebreak and breezes through his first service game of the fourth set.  nadal earns the first mini-break in the tiebreak as the match enters its fourth hour. a couple of stunning points follow  one where nadal chases down a roddick shot and turns into a passing winner. then roddick produces some amazing defence at the net to take the score to 4-4. roddick has two serves for the set but double-faults to take the score to 5-5. nadal saves a roddick set point then earns his own with a drive volley - and a crosscourt passing winner sends the crowd wild.  nadal tries to up his aggression and he passes roddick down the line to go 15-40 and two set points up. roddick saves the first with a desperate lunge volley and smacks a volley winner across the court to take the score back to deuce before securing the game. the set will go to another tiebreak.  nadal enjoys another straightforward hold and roddick must once again serve to stay in the set.  roddick again holds on  despite some brilliant shot-making from his opponent.  nadal races through his service game to put the pressure straight back onto roddick.  roddick hangs in on his serve to level matters but nadal is making him fight for every point.  nadal could be suffering a disappointment hangover from the previous game as he goes 0-30 down and then has to save a break point after a tremendous rally in which he is forced into some brilliant defence. but it pays off and the spaniard edges ahead in the set.  roddick s serve is not firing as ferociously as usual and has to rely on his sheer competitive determination to stay in the set. three times  nadal forces a break point and three times the world number two hangs in. and roddick s grit pays off as he manages to hold.  roddick still looks a bit sluggish but he attacks the net and is rewarded with a break point  which nadal saves with a good first serve and the spaniard goes on to hold.  there is a disruption in play as roddick is upset about something in the crowd. the spanish captain gets involved as does the match referee but it is unclear what the problem is. one thing for certain is that the crowd are roused into support of nadal and they go wild when roddick loses the next point and goes break point down. roddick saves the break point and then bangs down his ninth ace before clinching the game with a service winner.  the game passes the two-hour mark as nadal holds serve to edge ahead in the third set.  now roddick has to defend a break point and he produces a characteristic ace to save it. it is immediately followed by another and he holds with a little dinked half-volley winner.  roddick is looking a little leaden-footed but does carve out a break point for himself. but he plays it poorly and nadal avoids the danger.  roddick has gone off the boil and again struggles. he fails to get down properly for a low forehand volley and gives nadal three break points. the american blasts an ace to save one but follows up with a double fault and the rubber is level.  nadal edges towards taking the second set with a comfortable hold.  two good serves put roddick 30-0 up but he then makes a couple of errors to find himself 30-40 down. he saves the break point with an ace and then manages to hold.  roddick s level has dropped while nadal is on a hot streak. the spaniard includes a superb crosscourt winner off the back foot as he races through his service game without dropping a point.  roddick double-faults twice and nadal takes full advantage of the break point offered  powering a passing winner past roddick.  nadal wins another tight game. neither player has dipped from the high standard of play in the first set.  nadal puts the american under pressure and roddick saves a break point with a superb stop volley before going on to hold.  nadal puts the disappointment of losing the first-set tiebreak to claim the opening game in the second.  roddick double-faults to concede the first mini-break and then nadal loops a crosscourt winner to seize advantage in the tiebreak. he lets one slip but wins his next serve to earn three set points. but roddick saves them and then earns one himself. nadal comes up with a down-the-line winner but then nets tamely on roddick s next set point.  nadal s nerve is tested as he tries to force a tiebreak. both players come up with some scintillating tennis and the spaniard has several chances to clinch the game before finally doing so when roddick drives wide.  a pulsating game sees nadal racing round the court retrieving and refusing to give roddick any easy points. the point of the match so far involves roddick s slam-dunk smash being returned by nadal before roddick finally manages to end the rally. on the very next point  nadal blasts a forehand service return from right of court that passes roddick and even the american is forced to applaud. but roddick comes up with two big serves to polish off the game.  nadal outplays roddick to reach 40-0 but the american fights back to 40-30 before nadal s powerful crosscourt forehand winner secures the game.  the crowd are getting very involved  cheering between roddick s first and second serves. but the american comes through to hold and edge ahead in the set.  nadal manages to hold again despite roddick piling the pressure on his serve. the spaniard wins the game courtesy of another lucky net cord.  roddick double faults buts manages to keep his composure. a well-placed serve is unreturnable and roddick holds.  a powerful ace down the middle gives nadal a simple love service game - the first time he has held serve so far in the match. if roddick didn t know before  he knows now that he is in a real contest.  another superb game as nadal breaks to once again lift the roof. he produces some fine groundstrokes to leave roddick chasing shadows. four of the first five games have seen a break of serve.  despite the disappointment of losing his serve  roddick is not phased and storms into a 40-15 lead when the umpire leaves his seat to confirm a close line-call. nadal takes the next point but roddick breaks again with a sharp volley at the net.  roddick s advantage is short lived as nadal breaks back immediately. a fortunate net cord helps the spaniard on his way and when roddick fires a forehand cross court shot wide to lose his serve  nadal pumps his fist in celebration.  the american is pumped up for this clash and takes on nadal s serve from the start. nadal s drop shot is agonisingly called out and roddick claims the vital first break.  after moya s win in the opening rubber  a raucous seville crowd is buoyed by nadal s impressive start which sees him race into a 30-0 lead. however roddick fights back to hold his serve.,nadal put spain result nadal roddick spain rafael nadal beat andi roddick usa second singl match rubber davi cup final sevil spain lead carlo moya beat mardi fish

475,2015,desailly backs blues revenge trip marcel desailly insists there is no chance of history repeating itself when chelsea take on barcelona on wednesday.  the french star was part of the chelsea side crushed 5-1 at the nou camp in the champions league quarter-final second leg in 2000.  things will be totally different this time   he told bbc sport.  now everyone knows about chelsea and is a little bit afraid of them. they are one of the major clubs in europe and the pressure will be on barcelona.  chelsea have not played barcelona since that quarter-final tie five years ago. the blues had looked destined to progress after winning the first leg at stamford bridge 3-1  courtesy of two goals from tore andre flo and one by gianfranco zola. but they collapsed in the second leg  going down to strikes from rivaldo (2)  luis figo  dani and patrick kluivert.  former chelsea captain desailly  who is now playing for al-gharafa in qatar  says there is no comparison between that side and the current blues team  who are top of the premiership.  mentally they are much stronger  even though a lot of their players are young   the 36-year-old said.  we made some mistakes at the nou camp in 2000 - a lot of them were individual mistakes.  it would not happen now. this team has a new motivation and a different mentality.  world cup winner desailly saw huge changes during his time at stamford bridge. he was signed for £4.6m from ac milan in 1998 by ruud gullit and went on to play under gianluca vialli and claudio ranieri. but the biggest change occurred when billionaire roman abramovich bought the club in 2003. desailly says the russian s arrival helped to instil a winning mentality at the club as well as a demand for success.  the whole of chelsea is different now - the chairman  the manager and all the players   he said.   everything is new and there is a huge determination to win.  since that game in 2000  chelsea have gained more experience in europe and were very close to reaching the champions league final last season.  desailly is one of the most decorated players in the history of football. he won the 1998 world cup and 2000 european championship with france  the champions league in 1993 with marseilles and 1994 with ac milan  two serie a titles and the fa cup in 2000 with chelsea. he is now winding down his career in qatar  alongside the likes of frank lebeouf  josep guardiola  titi camara  gabriel batistuta and christophe dugarry. so he is full of admiration for two of his colleagues from the great milan side of the mid-90s who are likely to line up against manchester united on wednesday - paolo maldini and alessandro costacurta.  i m happy that they have managed to play so long at a high level   he said.  i made a vow to costacurta that as long as he plays  i will continue to play.  and it s amazing that paolo has managed to play at such a high level for such a long time.,desailli back blue reveng trip marcel desailli insist chanc histori repeat chelsea take barcelona wednesday french star part chelsea side crush nou camp champion leagu quarterfin second leg thing total differ time told bbc sport everyon know chelsea littl bit afraid one major club europ pressur barcelona chelsea play barcelona sinc quarterfin tie five year ago blue look destin progress win first leg stamford bridg courtesi two goal tore andr flo one gianfranco zola collaps second leg go strike rivaldo lui figo dani patrick kluivert former chelsea captain desailli play algharafa qatar say comparison side current blue team top premiership mental much strong even though lot player young yearold say make mistak nou camp lot individu mistak would happen team new motiv differ mental world cup winner desailli saw huge chang time stamford bridg sign £m ac milan ruud gullit go play gianluca vialli claudio ranieri big chang occur billionair roman abramovich bought club desailli say russian arriv help instil win mental club well demand success whole chelsea differ chairman manag player say everyth new huge determin win sinc game chelsea gain experi europ close reach champion leagu final last season desailli one decor player histori footbal world cup european championship franc champion leagu marseil ac milan two seri titl fa cup chelsea wind career qatar alongsid like frank lebeouf josep guardiola titi camara gabriel batistuta christoph dugarri full admir two colleagu great milan side mid like line manchest unit wednesday paolo maldini alessandro costacurta happi manag play long high level say make vow costacurta long play continu play amaz paolo manag play high level long time
476,1718,borders rail link campaign rally campaigners are to stage a rally calling for a borders rail link which was closed in 1969 to be reopened.  they will mark the 36th anniversary of the line closure  which ran from edinburgh through the borders and on to carlisle  with a walk at tweedbank. anne borthwick  of campaign for borders rail  said reopening the waverley line would restore the area s prosperity. msps are considering the reintroduction of passenger rail services through midlothian to the borders. campaigners have said that reopening the waverley line  which could cost up to £100m  would be a huge economic boost for the borders.  in 2000  borders council said the area s economy had suffered since the closure. ms borthwick said the lobby group was determined to keep the pressure on the scottish executive.  we are hoping that many people will join us in a march to mark the 36th anniversary of the closure of the waverley line   she said.  campaign for borders rail is the biggest independent lobby group in scotland and we have been lobbying tirelessly for the reinstatement of rail services to the borders and eventually to carlisle.   we believe that it is time for the scottish executive to commit to the first phase of the project by pledging to fund the line between edinburgh and tweedbank in the first instance and then investigate extending the line in the future.  ms borthwick said reopening the line would be a prosperous move and protect the character of the scottish borders. a study in 2000  which was commissioned by the executive  scottish borders council  midlothian council and scottish borders enterprise  found that a half-hourly service from tweedbank to edinburgh could cover its operating costs. it also found that a half-hourly service from gorebridge to edinburgh could cover operating costs and that a freight railway joining the west coast main line at longtown could also be reinstated.,border rail link campaign ralli campaign stage ralli call border rail link close reopen mark th anniversari line closur ran edinburgh border carlisl walk tweedbank ann borthwick campaign border rail say reopen waverley line would restor area prosper msp consid reintroduct passeng rail servic midlothian border campaign say reopen waverley line could cost £m would huge econom boost border border council say area economi suffer sinc closur m borthwick say lobbi group determin keep pressur scottish execut hope mani peopl join u march mark th anniversari closur waverley line say campaign border rail big independ lobbi group scotland lobbi tirelessli reinstat rail servic border eventu carlisl believ time scottish execut commit first phase project pledg fund line edinburgh tweedbank first instanc investig extend line futur m borthwick say reopen line would prosper move protect charact scottish border studi commiss execut scottish border council midlothian council scottish border enterpris found halfhourli servic tweedbank edinburgh could cover oper cost also found halfhourli servic gorebridg edinburgh could cover oper cost freight railway join west coast main line longtown could also reinstat
477,93,goldsmith:  i was not leant on  the attorney general has again denied being  leant on  by downing street to make the legal case for invading iraq.  claims a written answer on the legality of the war was drafted by downing street were  wholly unfounded   he insisted during stormy lords exchanges. lord goldsmith said the answer represented his  genuinely held independent view  the war was legal. the text was released on the eve of a crucial commons vote in which mps backed the invasion of iraq. many labour mps have since indicated that the attorney general s answer played a pivotal role in their willingness to back the conflict. the government has resisted calls to publish the full advice  saying such papers are always kept confidential. in the house of lords  the attorney general faced a call by former tory lord chancellor lord mackay to now publish the  full text  of the advice - the suggestion was rejected. another peer meanwhile  lord skidelsky  said not to publish the full legal opinion would  strengthen the suspicion that the the original text was doctored for public consumption  in exactly the same way as the notorious intelligence dossier on weapons of mass destruction .  last week lord goldsmith said in a statement:  i was fully involved throughout the drafting process and personally finalised  and of course approved  the answer.  he said the answer had been prepared in his office with the involvement of solicitor general harriet harman  two of his own officials  three foreign office officials  a qc  christopher greenwood and the then lord chancellor  lord irvine of lairg.  no other minister or official was involved in any way.   as i have always made clear  i set out in the answer my own genuinely held  independent view that military action was lawful under the existing (un) security council resolutions   he said.  the answer did not purport to be a summary of my confidential legal advice to government.  former foreign secretary robin cook said lord goldsmith s admission that his parliamentary answer was not a summary of his legal opinion suggested parliament may have been misled.  the attorney general may never have presented his answer as a summary  but others certainly did   he said.  what is clear from his statement today is that he does not believe that it was a full  accurate summary of his formal opinion.   tony blair has dismissed questions about the attorney general s advice  and said his parliamentary statement had been a  fair summary  of his opinion.  that s what he [lord goldsmith] said and that s what i say. he has dealt with this time and time and time again   mr blair told his monthly news conference in downing street. he refused to answer further questions on the issue. on the question of whether such papers have always been kept confidential  tory mp michael mates  who is a member of the commons intelligence and security committee and was part of the butler inquiry  told the bbc:  that  as a general rule  is right  but it s not an absolute rule.  he said there had been other occasions when advice had been published  most recently regarding prince charles s marriage plans. the government could not pick and choose when to use the convention  he said. mr mates added:  this may be one of those special occasions... when it would be in the public interest to see the advice which the attorney general gave to the prime minister.  a book published by philippe sands qc  a member of cherie blair s matrix chambers says lord goldsmith warned tony blair on 7 march 2003 that the iraq war could be illegal without a second un resolution sanctioning military action. a short statement about lord goldsmith s position presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 march 2003 - just before a crucial commons vote on the military action - did not suggest this.,goldsmith leant attorney gener deni leant down street make legal case invad iraq claim write answer legal war draft down street wholli unfound insist stormi lord exchang lord goldsmith say answer repres genuin held independ view war legal text releas eve crucial common vote mp back invas iraq mani labour mp sinc indic attorney gener answer play pivot role willing back conflict govern resist call publish full advic say paper alway kept confidenti hous lord attorney gener face call former torus lord chancellor lord mackay publish full text advic suggest reject anoth peer meanwhil lord skidelski say publish full legal opinion would strengthen suspicion origin text doctor public consumpt exactli way notori intellig dossier weapon mass destruct last week lord goldsmith say statement fulli involv throughout draft process person finalis cours approv answer say answer prepar offic involv solicitor gener harriet harman two offici three foreign offic offici qc christoph greenwood lord chancellor lord irvin lairg minist offici involv way alway make clear set answer genuin held independ view militari action law exist un secur council resolut say answer purport summari confidenti legal advic govern former foreign secretari robin cook say lord goldsmith admiss parliamentari answer summari legal opinion suggest parliament may misl attorney gener may never present answer summari other certainli say clear statement today believ full accur summari formal opinion toni blair dismiss question attorney gener advic say parliamentari statement fair summari opinion lord goldsmith say say dealt time time time mr blair told monthli news confer down street refus answer question issu question whether paper alway kept confidenti torus mp michael mate member common intellig secur committe part butler inquiri told bbc gener rule right absolut rule say occas advic publish recent regard princ charl marriag plan govern could pick choos use convent say mr mate ad may one special occas would public interest see advic attorney gener give prime minist book publish philipp sand qc member cheri blair matrix chamber say lord goldsmith warn toni blair march iraq war could illeg without second un resolut sanction militari action short statement lord goldsmith posit present write parliamentari answer march crucial common vote militari action suggest
478,2115,how the academy awards flourished the 77th annual academy awards are taking place on 27 february with the stars of the movie-making world once again holding their breath to discover who will be showered with the honours this year. but from humble beginnings  how did the modern day extravaganza become the behemoth it is today   how it all started the first academy awards were handed out in 1929 at a comparatively low-key dinner held at the hollywood roosevelt hotel - just over the road from their modern day home.  just 250 guests attended with ticket prices at $5.  the first film to win was wings  which starred clara bow in the only silent movie to win the big award. for the first 10 years or so  the winners list was handed to the newspapers so they could publish them at 11pm  but in 1940 the winners were published in the los angeles times at 8.45pm meaning guests entering the ceremony knew already knew the results. as a result the sealed envelope system was introduced  leading to the secrecy and suspense-filled night that happens today. when and where the tradition of holding the awards at a banquet continued until 1942 but with increasing interest came a growing guest list and it became impractical to host it as a dinner.  the ceremonies were then transferred to theatres with the famous grauman s chinese theatre the first to host the expanded event. other venues included the dorothy chandler pavilion and the shrine auditorium. they are now held at the kodak theatre  which opened in 2002 just across the road from its original home and holds 6 000 people. until 1954 they were held on a thursday  then swapped around from monday to wednesday before sunday night was settled on  although the month swapped from may to april to march and now its current month of february. the first televised ceremony was in 1953  with bob hope as the mc. who was oscar  there is no solid evidence as to how the trophy became to be known as oscar.  one popular story is that academy librarian margaret herrick said the statue looked like her uncle oscar. a journalist apparently overheard this conversation and used the phrase in an article.  the first time it is thought to have been used in print was when columnist sidney skolsky used it to describe katherine hepburn s first best actress win in 1934. the academy officially adopted the nickname in 1939. the trophy was designed by mgm art director cedric gibbons. since its inception 2 530 oscars have been handed out. in support of the war effort  the academy handed out plaster oscar statuettes during wwii. after the war  winners exchanged the plaster awards for the real thing. fifty-five statues were stolen in en route to the awards in 2000  52 were recovered nine days later. winners were unaffected as a new batch was rushed out. who sits in judgement  the academy was set up in 1927 as a non-profit organisation with 36 members from different film disciplines. douglas fairbanks sr was the first president and oversaw the first awards. there are now 5 700 members of the academy - with membership by invitation only to those who are seen to have achieved distinction in the movies and are therefore seen as fit to judge their peers. some of the criteria for admittance includes: film credits that reflect the high standards of the academy  receipt of an academy award nomination  achievement of unique distinction  earning of special merit  or making an outstanding contribution to film. the stars who left empty-handed while many of the biggest films and movie-makers have been honoured by the academy  there is still surprise at those that did not receive any nominations that later went on to become classics.  among the overlooked films were hobson s choice  dirty harry  the 39 steps  the searchers and king kong. actors that failed to win for their iconic roles included al jolson in the jazz singer (1927)  humphrey bogart in casablanca (1944)  gene kelly in singing in the rain (1952) and henry fonda in 12 angry men (1957). alfred hitchcock also failed to win an award despite five nominations. his enduring influence on the horror genre was finally recognised with an honorary gong in 1968. the show always goes on not even war has halted the glittering hollywood event. there were calls for it to be cancelled in 2003 during the war in iraq  but as it didn t stop during world war ii or the vietnam war.  documentary winner michael moore ensured nobody forgot about the iraq war though and used his acceptance speech to criticise the american invasion. the ceremony was muted with the glitz turned down and many female stars opting for demure dark dresses. the ceremony has been postponed on three occasions. los angeles floods in 1938 saw it put back a week. the death of martin luther king saw it postponed for two days in 1968 as a mark of respect and there was a 24-hour delay following the assassination attempt on president ronald reagan. controversies and other gaffes three people have refused oscars  including actor george c scott who said the whole thing was  demeaning . writer dudley nichols refused his academy award in 1935 for his screenplay for the insider because the writers  guild was striking at the time. marlon brando turned down his best actor oscar for the godfather in 1973 in protest as hollywood s apparent discrimination against native american people. he sent along a woman called sacheen littlefeather to collect his award. she was later revealed to be native american actress maria cruz.  the following year robert opal interrupted proceedings when he streaked  flashing a peace sign as well as everything else. the tv network managed to pan away and avoid too much nudity. opal was murdered in 1979. frank capra was the butt of one major gaffe in 1934 when the host opened out best picture envelope and declared  come on up and get it  frank  to which frank capra bounded up to the stage before realising that he had meant frank lloyd had won for cavalcade.  capra vowed he would never to go the awards again but went the following year to collect his award for it happened one night.,academi award flourish th annual academi award take place

480,1465,bmw cash to fuel mini production less than four years after the new mini was launched  german car maker bmw has announced £100m of new investment.  some 200 new jobs are to be created at the oxford factory  including modernised machinery and a new body shell production building. the result of the investment could be to raise output to more than 200 000 cars from 2007. the rise  from 189 000 last year  is a response to rapidly-rising demand and could help wipe out waiting lists. before wednesday s announcement  bmw had invested some £280m in mini production.  since its launch during summer 2001  the new mini has gone from strength to strength.  last year  almost one in six cars sold by the bmw group was a mini. the company admits that the success of the brand came despite scepticism from many in the industry.  our decision to produce a new mini was not received well right away   said norbert reithofer  a member of the bmw management board. initially  bmw said it would produce 100 000 mini models a year at its vast cowley factory on the outskirts of oxford  but the target was quickly reached  then raised  time and time again. not everyone is convinced that the boom can continue.  the risk is that after they ve invested massively in the brand  demand tapers off like it did with the new vw beetle   said brad wernle  from automotive news europe.  the price of the car has also gone up. when it was launched  the cheapest mini cost just more than £10 000. these days  buyers will have to fork out almost £11 500 to own a new mini one  or even more for the cooper s which costs up to £17 730. the mini convertible  which was launched last spring  costs up to £15 690 for the top model  and there is even a waiting list. second-hand minis are not cheap either. a mini one bought when the model was launched should still fetch at least £8 000 for the cheapest model  while a used cooper s is likely to be priced from £12 556  according to the-car buying website parker s. the consumers  association which operates with slightly different numbers  yet it confirms that the mini cooper 1.6 depreciates slower than any other car  other than the mercedes benz c180 se and the bmw 1 series 116i se.  the cowley factory  which initially seemed far too large a production plant for just 100 000 minis  is increasingly being put to good use.  there are plans to tear down old buildings and build new ones and there are rumours that a new paint shop could be included in the plans. bmw s mini adventure has made good much of what went wrong during its stewardship of the uk car maker rover which it sold for £10 five years ago to the phoenix consortium. in 1999  when bmw still owned rover  the oxford factory was producing the award-winning rover 75. during that year  3 500 people produced 56 000 cars. last year  in the same factory  almost four times as many vehicles were produced by just 4 500 mini-workers. the mini factory s current output is equally impressive when compared with the main rover factory in longbridge  which in 1999 produced 180 000 rover cars. last year  mg rover  which employs more than 6 000 people  produced just 110 000 cars  though it hopes to land a deal with shanghai automotive industry corporation (saic) that could help double the number of cars produced at longbridge. indeed  mini is not only producing more cars than mg rover does; it remains ahead even when the current sales of land rovers and range rovers (which are made by the former rover unit that bmw sold to ford) are taken into account.,bmw cash fuel mini product less four year new mini launch german car maker bmw announc £m new invest new job creat oxford factori includ modernis machineri new bodi shell product build result invest could rais output car rise last year respons rapidlyris demand could help wipe wait list wednesday announc bmw invest £m mini product sinc launch summer new mini go strength strength last year almost one six car sell bmw group mini compani admit success brand come despit sceptic mani industri decis produc new mini receiv well right away say norbert reithof member bmw manag board initi bmw say would produc mini model year vast cowley factori outskirt oxford target quickli reach rais time time everyon convinc boom continu risk invest massiv brand demand taper like new vw beetl say brad wernl automot news europ price car also go launch cheapest mini cost £ day buyer fork almost £ new mini one even cooper cost £ mini convert launch last spring cost £ top model even wait list secondhand mini cheap either mini one bought model launch still fetch least £ cheapest model use cooper like price £ accord thecar buy websit parker consum associ oper slightli differ number yet confirm mini cooper depreci slow car merced benz c se bmw seri i se cowley factori initi seem far larg product plant mini increasingli put good use plan tear old build build new one rumour new paint shop could includ plan bmw mini adventur make good much go wrong stewardship uk car maker rover sell £ five year ago phoenix consortium bmw still own rover oxford factori produc awardwin rover year peopl produc car last year factori almost four time mani vehicl produc miniwork mini factori current output equal impress compar main rover factori longbridg produc rover car last year mg rover employ peopl produc car though hope land deal shanghai automot industri corpor saic could help doubl number car produc longbridg inde mini produc car mg rover remain ahead even current sale land rover rang rover make former rover unit bmw sell ford take account

482,1623,uk  world s biggest music buyer  uk consumers are the biggest music buyers in the world  according to new figures released on tuesday by the british phonographic industry (bpi).  but global sales of recorded music were flat in 2004  with growing sales in dvd music videos offset by online and physical piracy in major markets. the uk music industry recorded an overall 3% increase in volume sales  mostly due to its robust albums market. however  world music sales declined by 1.3% to $33.6 billion (£17.7 billion). the uk cd albums market grew by 4.5% in 2004 with a record 174.6 million units sold. on average every briton buys 3.2 cds per person per year.  around 26 000 albums are released in the uk each year  making britain second only to the us in terms of the number of releases. overall sales were driven by new uk-signed artists such as keane  katie melua and scissor sisters  whose debut album sold almost 1.6 million copies in the uk.  a slew of great new british artists have met uk music fans  demand for great music   said bpi chairman peter jameson. the best-selling album globally was usher s confessions - one of eight albums to sell more than five million copies in 2004.  the growth in the dvd market and a sharp increase in sales of digital music ensured a strong market in the us. the total number of tracks downloaded last year were up more than tenfold on 2003. digital sales in the us in the first two months of 2005 are already more than double that of the same period in 2004.  however  some markets in continental europe and asia - notably sweden  finland  france  spain and south korea - have been drastically hit by internet piracy. australia  italy and the netherlands also saw a decline.  on the positive side digital sales are booming   said john kennedy  chief executive of the international federation of phonographic industries (ifpi).  however  commercial piracy and illegal file-sharing are continuing to depress our markets.  the priority in the coming year is to step up the advance of legitimate digital sales and sustain our anti-piracy efforts.   the main choice today s music fan now has to make is whether to get music legally or illegally   added mr jameson.,uk world big music buyer uk consum big music buyer world accord new figur releas tuesday british phonograph industri bpi global sale record music flat grow sale dvd music video offset onlin physic piraci major market uk music industri record overal increas volum sale mostli due robust album market howev world music sale declin billion £ billion uk cd album market grow record million unit sell averag everi briton buy cd per person per year around album releas uk year make britain second u term number releas overal sale driven new uksign artist kean kati melua scissor sister whose debut album sell almost million copi uk slew great new british artist met uk music fan demand great music say bpi chairman peter jameson bestsel album global usher confess one eight album sell five million copi growth dvd market sharp increas sale digit music ensur strong market u total number track download last year tenfold digit sale u first two month alreadi doubl period howev market continent europ asia notabl sweden finland franc spain south korea drastic hit internet piraci australia itali netherland also saw declin posit side digit sale boom say john kennedi chief execut intern feder phonograph industri ifpi howev commerci piraci illeg fileshar continu depress market prioriti come year step advanc legitim digit sale sustain antipiraci effort main choic today music fan make whether get music legal illeg ad mr jameson
483,1881,doors open at biggest gadget fair thousands of technology lovers and industry experts have gathered in las vegas for the annual consumer electronics show (ces).  the fair showcases the latest technologies and gadgets that will hit the shops in the next year. about 50 000 new products will be unveiled as the show unfolds. microsoft chief bill gates is to make a pre-show keynote speech on wednesday when he is expected to announce details of the next generation xbox.  the thrust of this year s show will be on technologies which put people in charge of multimedia content so they can store  listen to  and watch what they want on devices any time  anywhere. about 120 000 people are expected to attend the trade show which stretches over more than 1.5 million square feet. highlights will include the latest trends in digital imaging  storage technologies  thinner flat screen and high-definition tvs  wireless and portable technologies  gaming  and broadband technologies. the show also includes several speeches from key technology companies such as intel  microsoft  and hewlett packard among others.  the story this year remains all about digital and how that is completely transforming and revolutionising products and the way people interact with them   jeff joseph  from the consumer electronics association (cea) told the bbc news website.  it is about personalisation - taking your mp3 player and creating your own playlist  taking your digital video recorder and watch what you want to watch when - you are no longer at the whim of the broadcasters.   consumer electronics and gadgets had a phenomenal year in 2004  according to figures released by ces organisers  the cea  on tuesday. the gadget explosion signalled the strongest growth yet in the us in 2004. shipments of consumer electronics rose by almost 11% between 2003 and 2004. that trend is predicted to continue  according to cea analysts  with wholesale shipments of consumer technologies expected to grow by 11% again in 2005. the fastest-growing technologies in 2004 included blank dvd media  liquid crystal display (lcd) tvs  digital video recorders (dvrs)  and portable music players.  this year we will really begin to see that come to life in what we call place shifting -

484,2045,kennedy begins pre-election tour liberal democrat leader charles kennedy has begun a week-long tour to persuade voters they are the  real opposition .  mr kennedy is visiting constituencies in somerset and hampshire on monday - rural seats where his party is hoping to make gains from the conservatives. later he will visit places  such as liverpool  where labour is targeted. labour say a lib dem vote could  let the tories in   while the tories say the lib dems would mean  higher taxes  soft crime laws  more power to europe . mr kennedy s tour comes as he  labour leader tony blair and conservative leader michael howard all step up campaigning ahead of the next general election  widely expected to be held on 5 may. on tuesday mr kennedy will visit leicester south  where lib dem mp parmjit singh gill overturned a big labour majority to win the seat in last year s by-election.  stops in shrewsbury  north dorset  liverpool  manchester  basingstoke and west london are planned for later in the week. the liberal democrats say in the northern cities  the race is between them and labour  while in southern seats - particularly the south west - it is between them and the tories. speaking to the bbc s westminster hour on sunday  mr kennedy said the upcoming general election - widely tipped for 5 may - would be much more unpredictable than any others in  recent experience . asked whether it was realistic to assume the liberal democrats could win the general election  he said:  there s no limit to the ambitions we have as a party.  but we have got to be responsible  we have got to be credible  we have got to demonstrate to people that we are up to that task.   mr kennedy said the british public felt let down by labour on issues from iraq to top-up fees and the conservatives were not  asking the critical questions . and he said people were  highly sceptical  about labour and conservative promises on tax. but he brushed off labour suggestions a vote for his party would mean letting the tories in  by the back door .  if you look at the four previous parliamentary by-elections  the liberal democrats have demonstrated that  not only can we leapfrog the conservatives where we start in a third place position  but we can go on to defeat the government.  that s going to be the story  i think  of this coming general election.,kennedi begin preelect tour liber democrat leader charl kennedi begin weeklong tour persuad voter real opposit mr kennedi visit constitu somerset hampshir monday rural seat parti hope make gain conserv later visit place liverpool labour target labour say lib dem vote could let torus torus say lib dem would mean high tax soft crime law power europ mr kennedi tour come labour leader toni blair conserv leader michael howard step campaign ahead next gener elect wide expect held may tuesday mr kennedi visit leicest south lib dem mp parmjit singh gill overturn big labour major win seat last year byelect stop shrewsburi north dorset liverpool manchest basingstok west london plan later week liber democrat say northern citi race labour southern seat particularli south west torus speak bbc westminst hour sunday mr kennedi say upcom gener elect wide tip may would much unpredict other recent experi ask whether realist assum liber democrat could win gener elect say limit ambit parti get respons get credibl get demonstr peopl task mr kennedi say british public felt let labour issu iraq topup fee conserv ask critic question say peopl highli sceptic labour conserv promis tax brush labour suggest vote parti would mean let torus back door look four previou parliamentari byelect liber democrat demonstr leapfrog conserv start third place posit go defeat govern go stori think come gener elect

488,677,ukraine steel sell-off  illegal  the controversial sell-off of a ukrainian steel mill to a relative of the former president was illegal  a court has ruled.  the mill  krivorizhstal  was sold in june 2004 for $800m (£424m) - well below other offers. president viktor yushchenko  elected in december  is planning to revisit many of ukraine s recent privatisations. krivorizhstal is one of dozens of firms which he says were sold cheaply to friends of the previous administration.  on wednesday  prime minister yulia tymoshenko said as many as 3 000 firms could be included on the list of firms whose sale was being reviewed.  mr yushchenko had previously said the list would be limited to 30-40 enterprises. more than 90 000 businesses in all  from massive corporations to tiny shopfronts  have been sold off since 1992  as the command economy built up when ukraine was part of the soviet union was dismantled. analysts have suggested that the government needs to avoid the impression of an open-ended list  so as to preserve investor confidence.  thursday s ruling by a district court in perchesk overturned a previous decision in a lower court permitting the sale. the consortium which won the auction for the mill was created by viktor pinchuk  son-in-law of former-president leonid kuchma  and rinat akhmetov  the country s richest man. the next step is for the supreme court to annul the sale altogether  opening the way for krivorizhstal to be resold. mr yushchenko has suggested a fair valuation could be as much as $3bn. one of the foreign bidders who lost out  steel giant lnm  told bbc news that it would be interested in any renewed sale.,ukrain steel selloff illeg controversi selloff ukrainian steel mill rel former presid illeg court rule mill krivorizhst sell june m £m well offer presid viktor yushchenko elect decemb plan revisit mani ukrain recent privatis krivorizhst one dozen firm say sell cheapli friend previou administr wednesday prime minist yulia tymoshenko say mani firm could includ list firm whose sale review mr yushchenko previous say list would limit enterpris busi massiv corpor tini shopfront sell sinc command economi built ukrain part soviet union dismantl analyst suggest govern need avoid impress openend list preserv investor confid thursday rule district court perchesk overturn previou decis low court permit sale consortium auction mill creat viktor pinchuk soninlaw formerpresid leonid kuchma rinat akhmetov countri richest man next step suprem court annul sale altogeth open way krivorizhst resold mr yushchenko suggest fair valuat could much bn one foreign bidder lose steel giant lnm told bbc news would interest renew sale

491,644,rusedski angry over supplements greg rusedski has criticised the governing body of men s tennis for not releasing contamination-free supplements in time for the new season.  rusedski said:  i tried to order some but didn t receive any and i haven t got any yet.  you would think they would have been available in december as it can take two months for the body to respond.  this event comes in the hottest period of the year  so you would hope the stuff would be available for it.  the british number two escaped a possible ban last year when he persuaded a tribunal that a positive doping test was the result of contaminated atp supplements. in response  the atp struck a deal with pharmaceutical company glaxosmithkline to provide contamination-free drinks and nutritional bars for the men s tour.  david higdon  vice president of the atp  admitted:  i agree with greg.  i would have loved to have had these things available as soon as possible but it s a lot of work to make sure they have gone through rigorous testing.  the reality is though that the first two weeks of the tour are spread far and wide and part of the distribution agreement we had with gsk has an education component.  we weren t going to just drop these products out there without having a talk with the players about understanding how to use them.   the first chance we will get to do that is at the players meeting on the saturday before the australian open.  and rusedski  who takes on roger federer at the qatar open later on wednesday  conceded that the imminent changes will be beneficial.  the good thing is that there is now a 100% guarantee  so hopefully all this will never happen again   said rusedski.  hopefully after the australian open we won t have to discuss this any more.,rusedski angri supplement greg rusedski criticis govern bodi men tenni releas contaminationfre supplement time new season rusedski say tri order receiv get yet would think would avail decemb take two month bodi respond event come hottest period year would hope stuff would avail british number two escap possibl ban last year persuad tribun posit dope test result contamin atp supplement respons atp struck deal pharmaceut compani glaxosmithklin provid contaminationfre drink nutrit bar men tour david higdon vice presid atp admit agre greg would love thing avail soon possibl lot work make sure go rigor test realiti though first two week tour spread far wide part distribut agreement gsk educ compon go drop product without talk player understand use first chanc get player meet saturday australian open rusedski take roger feder qatar open later wednesday conced immin chang benefici good thing guarante hope never happen say rusedski hope australian open discus
492,1098,ask jeeves joins web log market ask jeeves has bought the bloglines website to improve the way it handles content from web journals or blogs.  the bloglines site has become hugely popular as it gives users one place in which to read  search and share all the blogs they are interested in. ask jeeves said it was not planning to change bloglines but would use the 300 million articles it has archived to round out its index of the web. how much ask jeeves paid for bloglines was not revealed.  bloglines has become popular because it lets users build a list of the blogs they want to follow without having to visit each journal site individually. to do this it makes use of a technology known as really simple syndication (rss) that many blogs have adopted to let other sites know when new entries are made on their journals. the acquisition follows similar moves by other search sites. google acquired pyra labs  makers of the blogger software  in 2003. in 2004 msn introduced its own blog system and yahoo has tweaked its technology to do a better job of handling blog entries. jim lanzone  vice president of search properties at ask jeeves in the us  said it did not acquire bloglines just to get a foothold in the blog publishing world. he said ask jeeves was much more interested in helping people find information they were looking for rather than helping them write it.   the universe of readers is vastly larger than the universe of writers   he said. mr lanzone said the acquisition would sit well with ask s my jeeves service which lets people customise their own web experience and build up a personal collection of useful links.  search engines are about discovering information for the first time and rss is the ideal way to keep track of and monitor those sites   he said. it would also help drive information and entries from blogs to the portals that ask jeeves operates. there would be no instant sweeping changes to bloglines  said mr lanzone.  our intent is to take our time to figure out the right business model not to try to monetise it right away   he said. though mr lanzone added that ask jeeves would be helping organise the database of 300m blog entries bloglines holds with its own net indexing technology.  being able to search the blogosphere as one corpus of information will be very useful in its own right   said mr lanzone. rumours about the acquisition were broken by the napsterization weblog which said it got the hint from ask jeeves insiders.,ask jeev join web log market ask jeev bought bloglin websit improv way handl content web journal blog bloglin site becom huge popular give user one place read search share blog interest ask jeev say plan chang bloglin would use million articl archiv round index web much ask jeev paid bloglin reveal bloglin becom popular let user build list blog want follow without visit journal site individu make use technolog know realli simpl syndic r mani blog adopt let site know new entri make journal acquisit follow similar move search site googl acquir pyra lab maker blogger softwar msn introduc blog system yahoo tweak technolog well job handl blog entri jim lanzon vice presid search properti ask jeev u say acquir bloglin get foothold blog publish world say ask jeev much interest help peopl find inform look rather help write univers reader vastli large univers writer say mr lanzon say acquisit would sit well ask jeev servic let peopl customis web experi build person collect use link search engin discov inform first time r ideal way keep track monitor site say would also help drive inform entri blog portal ask jeev oper would instant sweep chang bloglin say mr lanzon intent take time figur right busi model tri monetis right away say though mr lanzon ad ask jeev would help organis databas m blog entri bloglin hold net index technolog abl search blogospher one corpu inform use right say mr lanzon rumour acquisit broken napster weblog say get hint ask jeev insid

494,88,chinese dam firm  defies beijing  the china three gorges project corp is refusing to obey a government order to stop construction of one of its giant dams  the chinese state press has said.  the builder of the three gorges dam is continuing work on the sister xiluodu dam  said the beijing news. the xiluodu dam is one of 30 such large-scale construction projects called to a halt because of a lack of proper environmental checks. the beijing news said the company may instead choose to pay a fine. the firm has also ignored orders to stop construction at two of its other projects - the three gorges underground power plant and the three gorges project electrical power supply plant.  so far  only 22 of the 30 construction projects targeted by china s state environmental protection agency (sepa) for having not carried out mandatory environmental impact assessments have complied with its shutdown order. the china three gorges project corp could now face a fine up to 200 000 yuan ($24 000; £12 700). last week  it denied that its projects violated regulations.  the three gorges corporation has all along abided by the law and have built our projects in accordance with the law   it said.  the sepa order comes as the chinese government appears to be trying to cool the country s booming economy. previously it has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages  which forced many factories into part-time working last year. in 2004  china increased its generating capacity by 12.6% to 440 700 megawatts (mw). the xiluodu dam is designed to produce 12 600 mw of electricity  and is being built on the jinshajiang - or  river of golden sand  as the upper reaches of the yangtze are known. it is a sister project to the main three gorges dam downstream where more than half a million people have had to be relocated  drawing criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists.,chine dam firm defi beij china three gorg project corp refus obey govern order stop construct one giant dam chine state press say builder three gorg dam continu work sister xiluodu dam say beij news xiluodu dam one largescal construct project call halt lack proper environment check beij news say compani may instead choos pay fine firm also ignor order stop construct two project three gorg underground power plant three gorg project electr power suppli plant far construct project target china state environment protect agenc sepa carri mandatori environment impact ass compli shutdown order china three gorg project corp could face fine yuan £ last week deni project violat regul three gorg corpor along abid law built project accord law say sepa order come chine govern appear tri cool countri boom economi previous encourag construct new electr gener capac solv chronic energi shortag forc mani factori parttim work last year china increas gener capac megawatt mw xiluodu dam design produc mw electr built jinshajiang river golden sand upper reach yangtz know sister project main three gorg dam downstream half million peopl reloc draw critic environment group oversea human right activist

499,873,man utd through after exeter test manchester united avoided an fa cup upset by edging past exeter city in their third round replay.  cristiano ronaldo scored the opener  slipping the ball between paul jones  legs after just nine minutes. united wasted a host of chances to make it safe as jones made some great saves  but wayne rooney put the tie beyond doubt late on with a cool finish. exeter had chances of their own  sean devine twice volleying wide and andrew taylor forcing tim howard to save. united boss sir alex ferguson was taking few chances after their 0-0 draw in the first game and he handed starts to paul scholes and ryan as well as ronaldo and rooney. exeter began brightly with devine and steve flack seeing plenty of the ball  but it did not take united long to assert their authority and the hosts soon found themselves a goal down. scholes played a lovely pass in to ronaldo on the left-hand side of the six-yard box and the portuguese winger slid the ball between the legs of jones to open the scoring.  united sensed a chance to finish the tie as a contest early on and ronaldo blazed over before jones saved well from scholes and then rooney. the visitors  pressure by now was incessant and rooney had another shot blocked while ronaldo slammed well over the bar again from a good position. just before the break giggs had a golden chance to double the advantage  but the welshman dragged a left-foot effort badly wide from 10 yards. in stoppage time exeter created their best chance as alex jeannin swung in a cross from the left that devine managed to flick goalwards  but the ball flew wide of howard s goal. the grecians came out after the break in determined fashion and howard had to show safe hands to collect two searching crosses into the united box. rooney looked like he might have sealed the result with a turn and shot but the ball stuck in the st james park mud and jones raced back to gather on the goalline. moments later devine had the chance to make himself a hero  but he could only volley jeannin s brilliant cross wide of howard s goal after being left unmarked six yards out. after rooney had completely messed up a free-kick 20 yards out taylor showed him how it should be done  his stunning drive from distance forcing a flying stop from howard. the home crowd were baying for a goal and they did get the ball into the net only for devine s low effort to be ruled out for an obvious offside. the persistent rooney eventually rounded jones with three minutes to go and slotted into an empty net to book a home tie with middlesbrough in the fourth round.  jones  hiley  sawyer  gaia  jeannin  moxey  taylor (martin 89)  ampadu (afful 69)  clay  flack (edwards 74)  devine. subs not used: rice  todd.  ampadu  clay.  howard  phil neville  gary neville  o shea  fortune  giggs (saha 70)  miller (fletcher 66)  scholes  djemba-djemba (silvestre 80)  ronaldo  rooney. subs not used: ricardo  bellion.  ronaldo 9  rooney 87.  9 033.  p dowd (staffordshire).,man utd exet test manchest unit avoid fa cup upset edg past exet citi third round replay cristiano ronaldo score open slip ball paul jone leg nine minut unit wast host chanc make safe jone make great save wayn rooney put tie beyond doubt late cool finish exet chanc sean devin twice volley wide andrew taylor forc tim howard save unit bos sir alex ferguson take chanc draw first game hand start paul schole ryan well ronaldo rooney exet begin brightli devin steve flack see plenti ball take unit long assert author host soon found goal schole play love pas ronaldo lefthand side sixyard box portugues winger slid ball leg jone open score unit sen chanc finish tie contest earli ronaldo blaze jone save well schole rooney visitor pressur incess rooney anoth shot block ronaldo slam well bar good posit break gigg golden chanc doubl advantag welshman drag leftfoot effort badli wide yard stoppag time exet creat best chanc alex jeannin swung cross left devin manag flick goalward ball flew wide howard goal grecian come break determin fashion howard show safe hand collect two search cross unit box rooney look like might seal result turn shot ball stuck st jame park mud jone race back gather goallin moment later devin chanc make hero could volley jeannin brilliant cross wide howard goal left unmark six yard rooney complet mess freekick yard taylor show do stun drive distanc forc fli stop howard home crowd bay goal get ball net devin low effort rule obviou offsid persist rooney eventu round jone three minut go slot empti net book home tie middlesbrough fourth round jone hiley sawyer gaia jeannin moxey taylor martin ampadu af clay flack edward devin sub use rice todd ampadu clay howard phil nevil gari nevil shea fortun gigg saha miller fletcher schole djembadjemba silvestr ronaldo rooney sub use ricardo bellion ronaldo rooney p dowd staffordshir

504,2201,uk pioneers digital film network the world s first digital cinema network will be established in the uk over the next 18 months.  the uk film council has awarded a contract worth £11.5m to arts alliance digital cinema (aadc)  who will set up the network of up to 250 screens. aadc will oversee the selection of cinemas across the uk which will use the digital equipment. high definition projectors and computer servers will be installed to show mainly british and specialist films. most cinemas currently have mechanical projectors but the new network will see up to 250 screens in up to 150 cinemas fitted with digital projectors capable of displaying high definition images. the new network will double the world s total of digital screens. cinemas will be given the film on a portable hard drive and they will then copy the content to a computer server.  each film is about 100 gigabytes and has been compressed from an original one terabyte-size file. fiona deans  associate director of aadc  said the compression was visually lossless so no picture degradation will occur.  the film will all be encrypted to prevent piracy and each cinema will have an individual key which will unlock the movie.  people will see the picture quality is a bit clearer with no scratches.  the picture will look exactly the same as when the print was first made - there is no degradation in quality over time.   the key benefit of the digital network will be an increase in the distribution and screening of british films  documentaries and foreign language films.   access to specialised film is currently restricted across the uk   said pete buckingham  head of distribution and exhibition at the uk film council.  although a genuine variety of films is available in central london and a few other metropolitan areas  the choice for many outside these areas remains limited  and the digital screen network will improve access for audiences across the uk   digital prints costs less than a traditional 35mm print - giving distributors more flexibility in how they screen films  said ms deans.  it can cost up to £1 500 to make a copy of a print for specialist films.  in the digital world you can make prints for considerably less than that.  distributors can then send out prints to more cinemas and prints can stay in cinemas for much longer.  the uk digital network will be the first to employ 2k projectors - which are capable of showing films at resolutions of 2048 * 1080 pixels. a separate competitive process to determine which cinemas will receive the digital screening technology will conclude in may. the sheer cost of traditional prints means that some cinemas need to show them twice a day in order to recoup costs.  some films need word of mouth and time to build momentum - they don t need to be shown twice a day   explained ms deans.  a cinema will often book a 35mm print in for two weeks - even if the film is a roaring success they cannot hold on to the print because it will have to go to another cinema.  with digital prints  every cinema will have its own copy.,uk pioneer digit film network world first digit cinema network establish uk next month uk film council award contract worth £m art allianc digit cinema aadc set network screen aadc overse select cinema across uk use digit equip high definit projector comput server instal show mainli british specialist film cinema current mechan projector new network see screen cinema fit digit projector capabl display high definit imag new network doubl world total digit screen cinema give film portabl hard drive copi content comput server film gigabyt compress origin one terabyte file fiona dean associ director aadc say compress visual lossless pictur degrad occur film encrypt prevent piraci cinema individu key unlock movi peopl see pictur qualiti bit clearer scratch pictur look exactli print first make degrad qualiti time key benefit digit network increas distribut screen british film documentari foreign languag film access specialis film current restrict across uk say pete buckingham head distribut exhibit uk film council although genuin varieti film avail central london metropolitan area choic mani outsid area remain limit digit screen network improv access audienc across uk digit print cost less tradit mm print give distributor flexibl screen film say m dean cost £ make copi print specialist film digit world make print consider less distributor send print cinema print stay cinema much longer uk digit network first employ k projector capabl show film resolut pixel separ competit process determin cinema receiv digit screen technolog conclud may sheer cost tradit print mean cinema need show twice day order recoup cost film need word mouth time build momentum need show twice day explain m dean cinema often book mm print two week even film roar success hold print go anoth cinema digit print everi cinema copi
505,267,wolves appoint hoddle as manager glenn hoddle has been unveiled as the new wolves manager.  the ex-england coach has been given a six-month contract to succeed dave jones  who was sacked after the club s poor start to the season. wolves chairman rick hayward said:  we re delighted glenn is here. he has a six-month contract so we can test each other out and see if it works.  hoddle  who will work alongside stuart gray  has been out of the game since he was sacked by spurs in 2003. gray  who has been caretaker manager  was assistant boss when hoddle was manager at southampton.  i m delighted to be here   said hoddle.   i saw the massive potential that wolves have got and their desire and amibition to get back into the premiership parallels my ambitions.  stuart gray has done a fantastic job as caretaker manager. we ve worked together at southampton and i m delighted to be back with him.  wolves chief executive jez moxey defended the decision to give hoddle a short-term contract.  we hope it will work out for both parties and we extend it for the long term   he said.  most managers want a four-year contract and then expect it to be paid off if it doesn t work out.  for somebody of glenn s calibre to come in on a short-term contract and put his reputation on the line  it demonstrates his commitment and self-belief and the potential he thinks is here.  hayward revealed that hoddle was one of the first to be approached after jones  departure.  he was not available at the time because he was looking at various other things   he explained.  five weeks later we re back on track and this a tremendous opportunity for wolves.   hoddle began his managerial career as player-boss with swindon before moving on to chelsea and then taking up the england job. his spell in charge of the national side came to an end after the 1998 world cup when he made controversial remarks about the disabled in a newspaper interview. the 47-year-old later returned to management with southampton  where he again succeeded jones - as he has now done at wolves. he engineered an upturn in saints  fortunes before being lured to white hart lane by tottenham - the club where he made his name as a player. that relationship turned sour at the start of the last campaign and he left the london club early last season. since then he has applied unsuccessfully for the post of france manager and had also been linked with a return to southampton. wolves are currently 17th in the championship and have a home game against millwall on tuesday.,wolv appoint hoddl manag glenn hoddl unveil new wolv manag exengland coach give sixmonth contract succeed dave jone sack club poor start season wolv chairman rick hayward say delight glenn sixmonth contract test see work hoddl work alongsid stuart gray game sinc sack spur gray caretak manag assist bos hoddl manag southampton delight say hoddl saw massiv potenti wolv get desir amibit get back premiership parallel ambit stuart gray do fantast job caretak manag work togeth southampton delight back wolv chief execut jez moxey defend decis give hoddl shortterm contract hope work parti extend long term say manag want fouryear contract expect paid work somebodi glenn calibr come shortterm contract put reput line demonstr commit selfbelief potenti think hayward reveal hoddl one first approach jone departur avail time look variou thing explain five week later back track tremend opportun wolv hoddl begin manageri career playerboss swindon move chelsea take england job spell charg nation side come end world cup make controversi remark disabl newspap interview yearold later return manag southampton succeed jone do wolv engin upturn saint fortun lure white hart lane tottenham club make name player relationship turn sour start last campaign left london club earli last season sinc appli unsuccess post franc manag also link return southampton wolv current th championship home game millwal tuesday

509,2056,jobs growth still slow in the us the us created fewer jobs than expected in january  but a fall in jobseekers pushed the unemployment rate to its lowest level in three years.  according to labor department figures  us firms added only 146 000 jobs in january. the gain in non-farm payrolls was below market expectations of 190 000 new jobs. nevertheless it was enough to push down the unemployment rate to 5.2%  its lowest level since september 2001. the job gains mean that president bush can celebrate - albeit by a very fine margin - a net growth in jobs in the us economy in his first term in office. he presided over a net fall in jobs up to last november s presidential election - the first president to do so since herbert hoover. as a result  job creation became a key issue in last year s election. however  when adding december and january s figures  the administration s first term jobs record ended in positive territory.  the labor department also said it had revised down the jobs gains in december 2004  from 157 000 to 133 000.  analysts said the growth in new jobs was not as strong as could be expected given the favourable economic conditions.  it suggests that employment is continuing to expand at a moderate pace   said rick egelton  deputy chief economist at bmo financial group.  we are not getting the boost to employment that we would have got given the low value of the dollar and the still relatively low interest rate environment.   the economy is producing a moderate but not a satisfying amount of job growth   said ken mayland  president of clearview economics.  that means there are a limited number of new opportunities for workers.,job growth still slow u u creat few job expect januari fall jobseek push unemploy rate low level three year accord labor depart figur u firm ad job januari gain nonfarm payrol market expect new job nevertheless enough push unemploy rate low level sinc septemb job gain mean presid bush celebr albeit fine margin net growth job u economi first term offic presid net fall job last novemb presidenti elect first presid sinc herbert hoover result job creation becam key issu last year elect howev ad decemb januari figur administr first term job record end posit territori labor depart also say revis job gain decemb analyst say growth new job strong could expect give favour econom condit suggest employ continu expand moder pace say rick egelton deputi chief economist bmo financi group get boost employ would get give low valu dollar still rel low interest rate environ economi produc moder satisfi amount job growth say ken mayland presid clearview econom mean limit number new opportun worker
510,1858,parliament s record of scandal in a locked room at the heart of parliament there is a hive of scandal.  sex  betrayal and custody of children are all there in this affair but this time it has nothing to do with the recent troubles of david blunkett or boris johnson.  few realise that westminster in effect has its own divorce den. for sprinkled among 12 floors of archives are blow-by-blow accounts of marital break-ups - and now you can search what s there online. until 1857  the only way in england to get a full divorce which allowed re-marriage was to obtain an act of parliament by proving adultery or life-threatening cruelty. the legacy is pages of testimonies used in the hearings  dating back to 1670  all recorded among the 325 000 items which fill the 12 floors of the parliamentary archives in parliament s victoria tower. most people researching their family history want to discover some tale of illicit love. this gives them the chance.  divorce by parliament was an expensive process open really only to the rich but the records also include the testimony of maids  butlers and coachmen about their masters and mistresses. among the records is the story of jane campbell  the first woman ever to divorce her husband. that happened in 1801 after she had discovered her husband  edward addison  had committed adultery with her sister jessy.  a transcript of evidence from jessy s maid  amelia laugher  shows her telling how addison frequently passed by her on the way to the room where she had just put her mistress naked to bed. it must have been a killer blow to addison s case - he had already fled abroad rather than pay the £5 000 damages ordered by a civil court. as well as making divorce history  jane campbell won custody of her children - unusual for a woman at the time. but divorces are by no means the only documents in the archives which hold personal details of people often far removed from politics and parliament.  there are the protestation returns from 1642 - lists of the protestants who pledged to  maintain the true reformed protestant religion . there are details of foreign nationals made british citizens by act of parliament  including composer george frideric handel in 1727. and the mass of private bills which  for example authorise the building of railways and roads  contain both the names and addresses of those involved and testimonies giving people a unique perspective on how their ancestors opposed them.  tax bills may be an extra source for pedigree hunters - the longest stretches for about 300m and is longer than the palace of westminster itself  listing the names of appointed tax collectors. this wealth of material has long been open to the public at the house of lords record office  with visitors able to phone ahead when they want to view particular items in the search room. but now five years of work has produced an online catalogue. david prior  assistant clerk of the archives  says the catalogue opens up new possibilities for research.  before  you just could not do it  you faced trawling through pages and pages of printed material   he says. mr prior sees the changes as part of a wider revolution in archives generally.  the archive profession may look fairly staid but is in an enormous period of change  mainly motivated by the potential of it  which is opening up all sorts of vistas for us   he says.  the archives do  of course  hold records of high (and low) politics too for both houses of parliament  including copies of all acts passed since 1497 - the oldest dealing with the employment of workers in the woollen industry in norfolk. records for the commons only date back to 1834 - anything earlier was wiped out by the fire which destroyed most of the parliament buildings in 1834.  but that still leaves some of the most important documents of uk political history - parts of the bill of rights from 1689  the death warrant for charles i  the private papers and diaries of major politicians such as david lloyd george and andrew bonar law. there is also the 1606 act establishing 5 november as a thanksgiving day - the year after the gunpowder plot. that document is likely to feature in the exhibition the archives will put on next year as part of a series of events across london to mark the 400th anniversary of guy fawkes  conspiracy. as mr prior remarks as we walk by shelf after shelf of vellum (parchment made from goat s skin):  all human life is here.,parliament record scandal lock room heart parliament hive scandal sex betray custodi child affair time noth recent troubl david blunkett bori johnson realis westminst effect divorc den sprinkl among floor archiv blowbyblow account marit breakup search onlin way england get full divorc allow remarriag obtain act parliament prove adulteri lifethreaten cruelti legaci page testimoni use hear date back record among item fill floor parliamentari archiv parliament victoria tower peopl research famili histori want discov tale illicit love give chanc divorc parliament expens process open realli rich record also includ testimoni maid butler coachman master mistress among record stori jane campbel first woman ever divorc husband happen discov husband edward addison commit adulteri sister jessi transcript evid jessi maid amelia laugher show tell addison frequent pas way room put mistress nake bed must killer blow addison case alreadi flee abroad rather pay £ damag order civil court well make divorc histori jane campbel custodi child unusu woman time divorc mean document archiv hold person detail peopl often far remov polit parliament protest return list protest pledg maintain true reform protest religion detail foreign nation make british citizen act parliament includ compos georg frider handel mass privat bill exampl authoris build railway road contain name address involv testimoni give peopl uniqu perspect ancestor oppos tax bill may extra sourc pedigre hunter long stretch m longer palac westminst list name appoint tax collector wealth materi long open public hous lord record offic visitor abl phone ahead want view particular item search room five year work produc onlin catalogu david prior assist clerk archiv say catalogu open new possibl research could face trawl page page print materi say mr prior see chang part wider revolut archiv gener archiv profess may look fairli staid enorm period chang mainli motiv potenti open sort vista u say archiv cours hold record high low polit hous parliament includ copi act pas sinc old deal employ worker woollen industri norfolk record common date back anyth earlier wipe fire destroy parliament build still leav import document uk polit histori part bill right death warrant charl privat paper diari major politician david lloyd georg andrew bonar law also act establish novemb thanksgiv day year gunpowd plot document like featur exhibit archiv put next year part seri event across london mark th anniversari guy fawk conspiraci mr prior remark walk shelf shelf vellum parchment make goat skin human life

512,733,gb select holmes for double bid kelly holmes has been chosen for both the 800m and 1500m at next month s european indoor championships - despite not yet confirming her availability.  the double-olympic champion is still undecided about whether to compete in her first european indoors in madrid. but uk athletics chief max jones believes it is likely holmes will race. he said:  it s worth a punt  isn t it  she s gone back to training. if she s confident she will pick one (distance). the programme does not permit both.  if holmes does take her place in the gb side  she has already indicated that 1500m will be her favoured distance. under championship rules  she does not have to decide until 24 hours before the event begins in madrid on 4 march. jones added:  she was pleased with her run in birmingham (at last weekend s grand prix).  i am inclined to think she will (compete). it could depend on how training goes and she will have to be close to top form.  and he admitted holmes  presence would be a great boost to the rest of the norwich union gb team.  she is a very good team member and is very good to have there   he added. meanwhile  there is no surprises in the rest of the great britain team announced on tuesday.  defending 60m champion jason gardener is included and will be chasing his third successive gold medal. he will be joined in the event by mark lewis-francis - runner-up behind him three years ago in vienna - and new boy darren chin. kelly sotherton has been invited by championship organisers to compete against carolina kluft in the pentathlon. sotherton finished third in the olympic heptathlon in athens  where the swede took gold. there are 16 newcomers at this level of competition in gb s 46-strong team. the championships will be the last to be attended by jones before he retires to be succeeded by dave collins. jones said:  the olympic games is the overwhelming target for uka and therefore it is beneficial to start the next four-year cycle with a not-so-pressurised major games.  the european indoor championships always provide a chance for the young and inexperienced to make a name for themselves and the current indoor season has produced some exciting new talent.  madrid is the first small step on a long journey to beijing and the 2008 olympics but for some of the emerging athletes  this will be a very important step.   60m: d chin (belgrave harriers)  j gardener (wessex and bath)  m lewis-francis (birchfield harriers).  t abeyie (woodford green with essex ladies)  c lambert (belgrave harriers).  d

513,271,building giant in asbestos payout australian building products group james hardie has agreed to pay $1.1bn (£568m) to victims of asbestos-related diseases.  the landmark deal could see thousands of people suffering from lung diseases - caused by asbestos the company once made - receive compensation. the move follows angry protests after the firm said a previous compensation fund was running out of money. a subsequent new south wales state inquiry criticised hardie s actions. in september  the inquiry found that the company had misled the public about the amount of money set aside to cover its asbestos-related liabilities  sparking the resignation of its then chief executive  peter macdonald.  campaigners welcomed news of the preliminary agreement.  this is a momentous day in the fight for victims and their families   said asbestosis sufferer bernie banton  who leads a victims  association.  there is still a long way to go  but we are getting there.  james hardie chairwoman  meredith hellicar  said the deal provided for a funding arrangement  that is affordable  sensible and workable .  at the end of the day we are dealing with compensation for people who are terminally ill. we don t know exactly how many of them there will be  we don t know over what exact period they will fall ill   she said. however  the deal still has to receive the approval of hardie s shareholders.  hardie  which currently makes more than 80% of its revenues in the us  was once australia s biggest supplier of asbestos building materials. in 2001  the company set up a fund to compensate asbestos victims  but it later admitted the fund was running short of money. a decision by hardie to move its headquarters to the netherlands - while remaining a listed company in australia - provoked a damaging public outcry. victims groups accusing it of trying to escape its responsibilities by moving abroad  a charge the company denies. australia s securities watchdog is currently investigating hardie s former chief executive and former chief financial officer over allegations of misleading investors and the general public.,build giant asbesto payout australian build product group jame hardi agre pay bn £m victim asbestosrel diseas landmark deal could see thousand peopl suffer lung diseas caus asbesto compani make receiv compens move follow angri protest firm say previou compens fund run money subsequ new south wale state inquiri criticis hardi action septemb inquiri found compani misl public amount money set asid cover asbestosrel liabil spark resign chief execut peter macdonald campaign welcom news preliminari agreement moment day fight victim famili say asbestosi suffer berni banton lead victim associ still long way go get jame hardi chairwoman meredith hellicar say deal provid fund arrang afford sensibl workabl end day deal compens peopl termin ill know exactli mani know exact period fall ill say howev deal still receiv approv hardi sharehold hardi current make revenu u australia big supplier asbesto build materi compani set fund compens asbesto victim later admit fund run short money decis hardi move headquart netherland remain list compani australia provok damag public outcri victim group accus tri escap respons move abroad charg compani deni australia secur watchdog current investig hardi former chief execut former chief financi offic alleg mislead investor gener public

515,577,robots learn  robotiquette  rules robots are learning lessons on  robotiquette  - how to behave socially - so they can mix better with humans.  by playing games  like pass-the-parcel  a university of hertfordshire team is finding out how future robot companions should react in social situations. the study s findings will eventually help humans develop a code of social behaviour in human-robot interaction. the work is part of the european cogniron robotics project  and was on show at london s science museum.   we are assuming a situation in which a useful human companion robot already exists   said professor kerstin dautenhahn  project leader at hertfordshire.  our mission is to look at how such a robot should be programmed to respect personal spaces of humans.   the research also focuses on human perception of robots  including how they should look  and how a robot can learn new skills by imitating a human demonstrator.  without such studies  you will build robots which might not respect the fact that humans are individuals  have preferences and come from different cultural backgrounds   professor dautenhahn told bbc news online.  and i want robots to treat humans as human beings  and not like other robots   she added.  in most situations  a companion robot will eventually have to deal not only with one person  but also with groups of people. to find out how they would react  the hertfordshire cogniron team taught one robot to play pass-the-parcel with children.  showing off its skills at the science museum  the unnamed robot had to select  approach  and ask different children to pick up a parcel with a gift  moving it arm as a pointer and its camera as an eye. it even used speech to give instructions and play music. however  according to researchers  it will still take many years to build a robot which would make full use of the  robotiquette  for human interaction.  if you think of a robot as a companion for the human being  you can think of 20 years into the future   concluded professor dautenhahn.  it might take even longer because it is very  very hard to develop such a robot.   you can hear more on this story on the bbc world service s go digital programme.,robot learn robotiquett rule robot learn lesson robotiquett behav social mix well human play game like passtheparcel univers hertfordshir team find futur robot companion react social situat studi find eventu help human develop code social behaviour humanrobot interact work part european cogniron robot project show london scienc museum assum situat use human companion robot alreadi exist say professor kerstin dautenhahn project leader hertfordshir mission look robot program respect person space human research also focus human percept robot includ look robot learn new skill imit human demonstr without studi build robot might respect fact human individu prefer come differ cultur background professor dautenhahn told bbc news onlin want robot treat human human be like robot ad situat companion robot eventu deal one person also group peopl find would react hertfordshir cogniron team taught one robot play passtheparcel child show skill scienc museum unnam robot select approach ask differ child pick parcel gift move arm pointer camera eye even use speech give instruct play music howev accord research still take mani year build robot would make full use robotiquett human interact think robot companion human think year futur conclud professor dautenhahn might take even longer hard develop robot hear stori bbc world servic go digit programm
516,1833,worldcom ex-boss launches defence lawyers defending former worldcom chief bernie ebbers against a battery of fraud charges have called a company whistleblower as their first witness.  cynthia cooper  worldcom s ex-head of internal accounting  alerted directors to irregular accounting practices at the us telecoms giant in 2002. her warnings led to the collapse of the firm following the discovery of an $11bn (£5.7bn) accounting fraud. mr ebbers has pleaded not guilty to charges of fraud and conspiracy.  prosecution lawyers have argued that mr ebbers orchestrated a series of accounting tricks at worldcom  ordering employees to hide expenses and inflate revenues to meet wall street earnings estimates. but ms cooper  who now runs her own consulting business  told a jury in new york on wednesday that external auditors arthur andersen had approved worldcom s accounting in early 2001 and 2002. she said andersen had given a  green light  to the procedures and practices used by worldcom. mr ebber s lawyers have said he was unaware of the fraud  arguing that auditors did not alert him to any problems.  ms cooper also said that during shareholder meetings mr ebbers often passed over technical questions to the company s finance chief  giving only  brief  answers himself. the prosecution s star witness  former worldcom financial chief scott sullivan  has said that mr ebbers ordered accounting adjustments at the firm  telling him to  hit our books . however  ms cooper said mr sullivan had not mentioned  anything uncomfortable  about worldcom s accounting during a 2001 audit committee meeting. mr ebbers could face a jail sentence of 85 years if convicted of all the charges he is facing. worldcom emerged from bankruptcy protection in 2004  and is now known as mci. last week  mci agreed to a buyout by verizon communications in a deal valued at $6.75bn.,worldcom exboss launch defenc lawyer defend former worldcom chief berni ebber batteri fraud charg call compani whistleblow first wit cynthia cooper worldcom exhead intern account alert director irregular account practic u telecom giant warn lead collaps firm follow discoveri bn £bn account fraud mr ebber plead guilti charg fraud conspiraci prosecut lawyer argu mr ebber orchestr seri account trick worldcom order employe hide expens inflat revenu meet wall street earn estim m cooper run consult busi told juri new york wednesday extern auditor arthur andersen approv worldcom account earli say andersen give green light procedur practic use worldcom mr ebber lawyer say unawar fraud argu auditor alert problem m cooper also say sharehold meet mr ebber often pas technic question compani financ chief give brief answer prosecut star wit former worldcom financi chief scott sullivan say mr ebber order account adjust firm tell hit book howev m cooper say mr sullivan mention anyth uncomfort worldcom account audit committe meet mr ebber could face jail sentenc year convict charg face worldcom emerg bankruptci protect know mci last week mci agre buyout verizon commun deal valu bn
517,1374,uk economy facing  major risks  the uk manufacturing sector will continue to face  serious challenges  over the next two years  the british chamber of commerce (bcc) has said.  the group s quarterly survey of companies found exports had picked up in the last three months of 2004 to their best levels in eight years. the rise came despite exchange rates being cited as a major concern. however  the bcc found the whole uk economy still faced  major risks  and warned that growth is set to slow. it recently forecast economic growth will slow from more than 3% in 2004 to a little below 2.5% in both 2005 and 2006.  manufacturers  domestic sales growth fell back slightly in the quarter  the survey of 5 196 firms found. employment in manufacturing also fell and job expectations were at their lowest level for a year.   despite some positive news for the export sector  there are worrying signs for manufacturing   the bcc said.  these results reinforce our concern over the sector s persistent inability to sustain recovery.  the outlook for the service sector was  uncertain  despite an increase in exports and orders over the quarter  the bcc noted.  the bcc found confidence increased in the quarter across both the manufacturing and service sectors although overall it failed to reach the levels at the start of 2004. the reduced threat of interest rate increases had contributed to improved confidence  it said. the bank of england raised interest rates five times between november 2003 and august last year. but rates have been kept on hold since then amid signs of falling consumer confidence and a slowdown in output.  the pressure on costs and margins  the relentless increase in regulations  and the threat of higher taxes remain serious problems   bcc director general david frost said.  while consumer spending is set to decelerate significantly over the next 12-18 months  it is unlikely that investment and exports will rise sufficiently strongly to pick up the slack.,uk economi face major risk uk manufactur sector continu face seriou challeng next two year british chamber commerc bcc say group quarterli survey compani found export pick last three month best level eight year rise come despit exchang rate cite major concern howev bcc found whole uk economi still face major risk warn growth set slow recent forecast econom growth slow littl manufactur domest sale growth fell back slightli quarter survey firm found employ manufactur also fell job expect low level year despit posit news export sector worri sign manufactur bcc say result reinforc concern sector persist inabl sustain recoveri outlook servic sector uncertain despit increas export order quarter bcc note bcc found confid increas quarter across manufactur servic sector although overal fail reach level start reduc threat interest rate increas contribut improv confid say bank england rais interest rate five time novemb august last year rate kept hold sinc amid sign fall consum confid slowdown output pressur cost margin relentless increas regul threat high tax remain seriou problem bcc director gener david frost say consum spend set deceler significantli next month unlik invest export rise suffici strongli pick slack

522,40,german growth goes into reverse germany s economy shrank 0.2% in the last three months of 2004  upsetting hopes of a sustained recovery.  the figures confounded hopes of a 0.2% expansion in the fourth quarter in europe s biggest economy. the federal statistics office said growth for the whole of 2004 was 1.6%  after a year of contraction in 2003  down from an earlier estimate of 1.7%. it said growth in the third quarter had been zero  putting the economy at a standstill from july onward. germany has been reliant on exports to get its economy back on track  as unemployment of more than five million and impending cuts to welfare mean german consumers have kept their money to themselves. major companies including volkswagen  daimlerchrysler and siemens have spent much of 2004 in tough talks with unions about trimming jobs and costs. according to the statistics office  destatis  rising exports were outweighed in the fourth quarter by the continuing weakness of domestic demand.  but the relentless rise in the value of the euro last year has also hit the competitiveness of german products overseas. the effect has been to depress prospects for the 12-nation eurozone as a whole  as well as germany. eurozone interest rates are at 2%  but senior officials at the rate-setting european central bank are beginning to talk about the threat of inflation  prompting fears that interest rates may rise. the ecb s mandate is to fight rising prices by boosting interest rates - and that could further threaten germany s hopes of recovery.,german growth goe revers germani economi shrank last three month upset hope sustain recoveri figur confound hope expans fourth quarter europ big economi feder statist offic say growth whole year contract earlier estim say growth third quarter zero put economi standstil juli onward germani reliant export get economi back track unemploy five million impend cut welfar mean german consum kept money major compani includ volkswagen daimlerchrysl siemen spent much tough talk union trim job cost accord statist offic destati rise export outweigh fourth quarter continu weak domest demand relentless rise valu euro last year also hit competit german product oversea effect depress prospect nation eurozon whole well germani eurozon interest rate senior offici rateset european central bank begin talk threat inflat prompt fear interest rate may rise ecb mandat fight rise price boost interest rate could threaten germani hope recoveri

525,789,virus poses as christmas e-mail security firms are warning about a windows virus disguising itself as an electronic christmas card.  the zafi.d virus translates the christmas greeting on its subject line into the language of the person receiving infected e-mail. anti-virus firms speculate that this multilingual ability is helping the malicious program spread widely online. anti-virus firm sophos said that 10% of the e-mail currently on the net was infected with the zafi virus.  like many other windows viruses  zafi-d plunders microsoft outlook for e-mail addresses and then uses mail-sending software to despatch itself across the web to new victims. to be infected users must open up the attachment travelling with the message which bears the code for the malicious bug. the attachment on the e-mail poses as an electronic christmas card but anyone opening it will simply get a crude image of two smiley faces.  the virus  subject line says  merry christmas  and translates this into one of 15 languages depending of the final suffix of the e-mail address the infected message has been sent to. the message in the body of the e-mail reads:  happy holidays  and this too is translated. on infected machines the virus tries to disable anti-virus and firewall software and opens up a backdoor on the pc to hand over control to the writer of the virus. the virus is thought to have spread most widely in south america  italy  spain  bulgaria and hungary. the original zafi virus appeared in april this year.  we have seen these hoaxes for several christmases already  and personally i prefer traditional pen and paper cards  and we recommend this to all our clients too   said mikko hypponen  who heads f-secure s anti-virus team.,viru pose christma email secur firm warn window viru disguis electron christma card zafid viru translat christma greet subject line languag person receiv infect email antiviru firm specul multilingu abil help malici program spread wide onlin antiviru firm sopho say email current net infect zafi viru like mani window virus zafid plunder microsoft outlook email address use mailsend softwar despatch across web new victim infect user must open attach travel messag bear code malici bug attach email pose electron christma card anyon open simpli get crude imag two smiley face viru subject line say merri christma translat one languag depend final suffix email address infect messag sent messag bodi email read happi holiday translat infect machin viru tri disabl antiviru firewal softwar open backdoor pc hand control writer viru viru thought spread wide south america itali spain bulgaria hungari origin zafi viru appear april year see hoax sever christmas alreadi person prefer tradit pen paper card recommend client say mikko hypponen head fsecur antiviru team
526,253,ukip candidate suspended in probe eurosceptic party ukip have suspended a candidate for allegedly suggesting the criminally insane should be killed.  john houston  54  was due to stand in the east kilbride seat in lanarkshire at the next election. but he was suspended after his reported views  including the return of the british empire  were sent to two scottish newspapers. ukip spokesman mark croucher said those who selected mr houston knew nothing of his views. the episode comes at a difficult time for ukip  soon after the high-profile departure of mep robert kilroy-silk. mr houston is alleged to have said that the organs of the criminally insane should be  made available to law-abiding members of the community  and proposed the legalisation of drugs and the sex trade. the document reportedly said:  we re looking for the resurrection of the british empire.  the problems for the human race - environmental and others - can only be dealt with on a global scale  and that calls for a radical alliance of the english-speaking nations  which they are uniquely able to do.  mr croucher said the main issue would be that mr houston s reported views had been presented as ukip policy  which they were not. he said they might have been submissions to a committee working on the party s manifesto  but would not have been matched to mr houston when he was standing to become a candidate. he told bbc news:  he appears to have said these things. we have suspended him as a member and as a candidate.  by all accounts none of this was mentioned at his selection meeting.  it is simply a distraction from the task in hand  the eu constitution  not individual idiocies.  mr houston was quoted in the herald newspaper saying:  i feel ukip have over-reacted and overshot the runway.   peter nielson  who is ukip scotland chairman  said he had suspended mr houston on friday night.  he will remain suspended while the matter is being investigated and then we will decide if and what further action will be taken.  he said that any evidence would be looked into and mr houston may be interviewed by the party. he added:  i can t comment too much at the moment  i have one version from him but i haven t seen the papers yet.,ukip candid suspend probe euroscept parti ukip suspend candid allegedli suggest crimin insan kill john houston due stand east kilbrid seat lanarkshir next elect suspend report view includ return british empir sent two scottish newspap ukip spokesman mark croucher say select mr houston knew noth view episod come difficult time ukip soon highprofil departur mep robert kilroysilk mr houston alleg say organ crimin insan make avail lawabid member commun propos legalis drug sex trade document reportedli say look resurrect british empir problem human race environment other dealt global scale call radic allianc englishspeak nation uniqu abl mr croucher say main issu would mr houston report view present ukip polici say might submiss committe work parti manifesto would match mr houston stand becom candid told bbc news appear say thing suspend member candid account none mention select meet simpli distract task hand eu constitut individu idioci mr houston quot herald newspap say feel ukip overreact overshot runway peter nielson ukip scotland chairman say suspend mr houston friday night remain suspend matter investig decid action take say evid would look mr houston may interview parti ad comment much moment one version see paper yet

528,1208,uk s national gallery in the pink the national gallery  home to some of the uk s greatest artworks  has seen a big jump in visitor numbers.  five million visitors made the london gallery - which houses treasures like raphael s madonna of the pinks - the uk s most visited museum in 2004. it recorded a 13.8% rise in numbers and was the country s second most visited tourist attraction  behind blackpool pleasure beach. charles saumarez smith  the gallery s director  said he was  delighted . he said the number of visitors through the doors had boosted figures to pre-11 september 2001 levels. mr saumarez smith added that the pedestrianisation of trafalgar square  where the gallery is located  and strong temporary collections throughout 2004 had led to the strong performance.   our 2004 exhibition programme of el greco  russian landscape in the age of tolstoy and raphael: from urbino to rome was particularly strong and exceeded all targets   he said.  the exceptional quality of the paintings in our permanent collection is also huge draw for the public.  the expectations of today s visitors are higher than ever and we have kept pace with their demands.  mr saumarez smith said he was confident the gallery could maintain the attendance.  with important exhibitions of the work of caravaggio  stubbs and rubens in place for 2005  i am confident that the gallery is set for another highly successful year   he added. the figures were prepared by the association of leading visitor attractions (alva).  it found that the figures had been boosted by an increase in europeans travelling to the uk on budget airlines. popular cultural tourist spots such as the tate modern and the natural history museum all recorded increases of more than 10% in visitor numbers compared with 2003. but for legal or confidentiality reasons some alva members did not submit figures for 2004  including buckingham palace  windsor castle  madame tussauds and alton towers. alva director robin broke said:  visits from western europe were up by 10% and from north america by some 9% compared to 2003  while numbers from the rest of the world rose 20%.  european figures were helped by the rapid growth of low-cost flights to britain from europe  especially from new eu countries.,uk nation galleri pink nation galleri home uk great artwork see big jump visitor number five million visitor make london galleri hous treasur like raphael madonna pink uk visit museum record rise number countri second visit tourist attract behind blackpool pleasur beach charl saumarez smith galleri director say delight say number visitor door boost figur pre septemb level mr saumarez smith ad pedestrianis trafalgar squar galleri locat strong temporari collect throughout lead strong perform exhibit programm el greco russian landscap age tolstoy raphael urbino rome particularli strong exceed target say except qualiti paint perman collect also huge draw public expect today visitor high ever kept pace demand mr saumarez smith say confid galleri could maintain attend import exhibit work caravaggio stubb ruben place confid galleri set anoth highli success year ad figur prepar associ lead visitor attract alva found figur boost increas european travel uk budget airlin popular cultur tourist spot tate modern natur histori museum record increas visitor number compar legal confidenti reason alva member submit figur includ buckingham palac windsor castl madam tussaud alton tower alva director robin broke say visit western europ north america compar number rest world rise european figur help rapid growth lowcost flight britain europ especi new eu countri
529,865,uk gets official virus alert site a rapid alerting service that tells home computer users about serious internet security problems is being launched by the uk government.  the service  it safe  will issue warnings about damaging viruses  software vulnerabilities and weaknesses on devices such as mobile phones. alerts tell people how the threats affect them and what they can do to avoid trouble and protect themselves. the service will be free and those who sign up can get e-mail or text alerts. the scheme is aimed at home users and small businesses. the government estimates it will issue security alerts about six to 10 times a year  based on previous experience of virus outbreaks.  there is a clear need for easy-to-understand and simple independent advice for non-technically minded people who use computers either at home or at work   said home office minister hazel blears.  the purpose of this new government service is to ensure computer users are aware of the risks involved and how to deal with them easily and effectively without causing alarm.  those signing up will only be told about the most serious security threats that have the potential to affect millions of people.  full-time staff are being employed to comb through the many hundreds of alerts issued each year by computer security firms to spot which ones have the potential to catch out a large number of people between alerts the service will occasionally send messages giving people advice about safe ways to use their computers and phones.  it safe will take our technical expertise and use it to help home users understand the risks and keep their computer systems  mobile phones and a range of related consumer electronic items  safe   said roger cumming  director of the national infrastructure security coordination centre (niscc).  the niscc  which is running the service  also stressed that those signing up would still need to use anti-virus software  firewalls  and software updates to stay secure. warnings about security problems will tell people what the problem is  how it affects them and what they can do to avoid trouble. alerts will not be issued unless users can do something to protect themselves against the threat. this might include downloading an update from an anti-virus vendor or updating software to close loopholes and fix vulnerabilities. however no software patches or programs will actually be dispensed through the site. the alerts will tell people how to go about getting hold of patches from security firms. the niscc spokesman said the site and alerting service would stay in existence for as long as there were security bugs on home computers and other gadgets.  government statistics show that more than half of all uk households own a home computer. it was estimated that almost 13 million of these were able to access the internet in 2004. the launch comes as the number of viruses and other malicious programs in existence is reaching unprecedented numbers. in september 2004  the number of malicious programs circulating topped the 100 000 mark. some fear that this figure could hit 150 000 by september 2005. the creation of the national alert service follows similar efforts in the netherlands and us. the national alerting service for the netherlands (aka de waarschuwingsdienst) and the us national cyber alerting service also tell citizens

530,399,burglar defence guidelines issued householders who injure or even kill intruders are unlikely to be prosecuted - providing they were acting  honestly and instinctively   new guidelines say.  the law also protects those who use  something to hand  as a weapon. the leaflet  published by police and prosecutors  aims to combat confusion about current legislation  which lets people use  reasonable force . the guidance  relating to england and wales  follows a recent decision by ministers not to change the law. doing what you  honestly and instinctively  believed was necessary would be the strongest evidence of acting lawfully  the guidance said.  and the law protects those who use  something to hand  as a weapon  said the leaflet published jointly by the crown prosecution service (cps) and association of chief police officers (acpo).  as a general rule  the more extreme the circumstances and fear felt  the more force can be used lawfully in self-defence  it said  adding that householders do not have to wait to be attacked before defending themselves. but knocking someone unconscious then killing them or hurting them further  or setting a trap for an intruder without involving the police were given as examples of  excessive and gratuitous  force. the tories have called for a change in the law so householders are only prosecuted if they use  grossly disproportionate  force. their demands have been backed by former metropolitan police commissioner sir john stevens. tory frontbencher patrick mercer is now pursuing the proposal through a private member s bill in parliament.  the government instead mounted a publicity campaign to clear up public uncertainty after a review concluded no law change was necessary. home secretary charles clarke said:  i believe in that old adage  an englishman s home is his castle . that s exactly what should be the case and i believe the current law provides that.  an  informal trawl  of cps records found 11 people had been prosecuted after attacking intruders in the past 15 years  five of whom were convicted. they included a man who laid in wait for a burglar on commercial premises in cheshire  before beating him up  throwing him into a pit and setting him on fire.  a cps spokesperson said the figures were not definitive because prosecutions are not listed according to whether they were committed by a householder on an intruder. in one of britain s highest profile cases  norfolk farmer tony martin was jailed for life for murdering 16-year-old burglar fred barras  in 1999. the conviction was later reduced to manslaughter on appeal and the sentence cut to five years. mr martin was freed from prison in july 2003. the guidance published on tuesday  said the police had a duty to investigate all incidents involving a death or injury. in cases involving householders attacking intruders prosecutors and police were  determined  they would be dealt with  as swiftly and as sympathetically as possible   it said.,burglar defenc guidelin issu household injur even kill intrud unlik prosecut provid act honestli instinct new guidelin say law also protect use someth hand weapon leaflet publish polic prosecutor aim combat confus current legisl let peopl use reason forc guidanc relat england wale follow recent decis minist chang law honestli instinct believ necessari would strong evid act law guidanc say law protect use someth hand weapon say leaflet publish jointli crown prosecut servic cp associ chief polic offic acpo gener rule extrem circumst fear felt forc use law selfdef say ad household wait attack defend knock someon unconsci kill hurt set trap intrud without involv polic give exampl excess gratuit forc torus call chang law household prosecut use grossli disproportion forc demand back former metropolitan polic commission sir john steven torus frontbench patrick mercer pursu propos privat member bill parliament govern instead mount public campaign clear public uncertainti review conclud law chang necessari home secretari charl clark say believ old adag englishman home castl exactli case believ current law provid inform trawl cp record found peopl prosecut attack intrud past year five convict includ man laid wait burglar commerci premis cheshir beat throw pit set fire cp spokesperson say figur definit prosecut list accord whether commit household intrud one britain high profil case norfolk farmer toni martin jail life murder yearold burglar fred barra convict later reduc manslaught appeal sentenc cut five year mr martin freed prison juli guidanc publish tuesday say polic duti investig incid involv death injuri case involv household attack intrud prosecutor polic determin would dealt swiftli sympathet possibl say

534,639,could rivalry overshadow election  tony blair and gordon brown are desperately trying to stuff the genie of their rivalry back into the bottle.  along with any number of senior cabinet colleagues  they are insisting their only job is to win the next election and govern in the best interests of britain. it is a message they are aiming directly at their backbenchers who are becoming irritated and even unnerved by the continuing claims and counter claims surrounding this alleged rift. ian gibson  for example  urged the two men to stop squabbling  declaring:  for goodness sake  sometimes you have to rise above petulance and make sure that you do your job as effectively as you can.  those with slim majorities are particularly fearful that the rift could hit their own hopes of re-election. tony blair will seek to reassure labour mps on monday evening at their first meeting of the new year at westminster - a behind-closed doors meeting which gordon brown is thought likely to also attend to show unity.  meanwhile the likes of health secretary john reid and labour peer lord haskins are warning of the electoral dangers of allowing this soap opera to continue. and they have both warned the rival camps to stop spreading the poison. lord haskins even suggested mr blair should reinstate mr brown as the central figure in the election planning.  but this particular genie is unusually reluctant to return to captivity and many fear it is simply too late to repair the damage. they believe they will be fighting the next election with the sounds of open warfare between the two men ringing in their ears. and it matters little whether the rift is real or  as some try to suggest  simply the product of newspaper headlines and westminster gossip. few in westminster actually believe that  simply because the evidence appears to contradict it.  for example  the weekend s attempts by both men to play down the divisions failed to do the trick. even as they were both insisting on their unity of purpose and claiming they would not be swayed by newspaper stories  they still managed to stir the speculation with their comments.  mr blair talked about the  new  labour manifesto - a move which seemed calculated to irritate the chancellor  who has long rejected the label. and mr brown pointedly refused to deny claims the prime minister had reneged on a deal to hand him the premiership last year. that claim was repeated in robert peston s book  a book which amply demonstrates this corrosive downing street soap opera is nowhere near its final act.  for his part  mr brown insists his only motivation was to get labour re-elected.  the trouble is  both men have fallen short of offering simple  straightforward denials of the central claims. so they have both been accused of actually making matters worse by feeding the speculation with their own behaviour. the first thing to be said is that these suggestions have not come from nowhere. they started with and are sustained by  friends  of the two men. one only had to listen to the chancellor s friend and former spin chief charlie whelan last week to understand that there is a real anger from this camp at the prime minister s apparent attempts to confound mr brown s leadership ambitions. but it is not just public pronouncements from ex-aides.  there are whispered briefings to selected journalists from both sides. it is no secret in westminster  for example  that downing street believes the chancellor is indulging in a mammoth sulk and acting in a petty and deliberately provocative manner.  then there are the actions of the men themselves. gordon brown sets out what is seen as a rival manifesto then appears to embark on his own personal campaign. the prime minister responds by scheduling his monthly press conference to clash with a keynote speech by the chancellor. meanwhile large numbers of backbench mps insist voters are either entirely uninterested in the chatter  which they believe is a media-only obsession  or that they fear for the efficient running of a government beset by such rivalry. either way  there is universal agreement that if this goes on through the general election it can only do the labour party serious damage. there are signs that the two men appreciate the dangers and both want to put a lid on all the speculation. but with probably only four months to the next election  that looks like being a particularly difficult trick to pull off.,could rivalri overshadow elect toni blair gordon brown desper tri stuff geni rivalri back bottl along number senior cabinet colleagu insist job win next elect govern best interest britain messag aim directli backbench becom irrit even unnerv continu claim counter claim surround alleg rift ian gibson exampl urg two men stop squabbl declar good sake sometim rise petul make sure job effect slim major particularli fear rift could hit hope reelect toni blair seek reassur labour mp monday even first meet new year westminst behindclos door meet gordon brown thought like also attend show uniti meanwhil like health secretari john reid labour peer lord haskin warn elector danger allow soap opera continu warn rival camp stop spread poison lord haskin even suggest mr blair reinstat mr brown central figur elect plan particular geni unusu reluct return captiv mani fear simpli late repair damag believ fight next elect sound open warfar two men ring ear matter littl whether rift real tri suggest simpli product newspap headlin westminst gossip westminst actual believ simpli evid appear contradict exampl weekend attempt men play divis fail trick even insist uniti purpos claim would sway newspap stori still manag stir specul comment mr blair talk new labour manifesto move seem calcul irrit chancellor long reject label mr brown pointedli refus deni claim prime minist reneg deal hand premiership last year claim repeat robert peston book book ampli demonstr corros down street soap opera nowher near final act part mr brown insist motiv get labour reelect troubl men fall short offer simpl straightforward denial central claim accus actual make matter wors feed specul behaviour first thing say suggest come nowher start sustain friend two men one listen chancellor friend former spin chief charli whelan last week understand real anger camp prime minist appar attempt confound mr brown leadership ambit public pronounc exaid whisper brief select journalist side secret westminst exampl down street believ chancellor indulg mammoth sulk act petti deliber provoc manner action men gordon brown set see rival manifesto appear embark person campaign prime minist respond schedul monthli press confer clash keynot speech chancellor meanwhil larg number backbench mp insist voter either entir uninterest chatter believ mediaonli ob fear effici run govern beset rivalri either way univers agreement goe gener elect labour parti seriou damag sign two men appreci danger want put lid specul probabl four month next elect look like particularli difficult trick pull
535,816,gangsters dominate gaming chart video games on consoles and computers proved more popular than ever in 2004.  gamers spent more than £1.34bn in 2004  almost 7% more than they did in 2003 according to figures released by the uk gaming industry s trade body. sales records were smashed by the top title of the year gta: san andreas - in which players got the job of turning central character cj into a crime boss. the game sold more than 1 million copies in the first nine days that it was on sale. this feat made it the fastest selling video game of all time in the uk. although only released in november the sprawling story of guns  gangsters game beat off strong competition and by year end had sold more than 1.75 million copies. there were also records set for the number of games that achieved double-platinum status by selling more than 600 000 copies. five titles  including sony eyetoy play and ea s need for speed: underground 2  managed this feat according to figures compiled by chart-track for the entertainment and leisure software publishers association (elspa). electronic arts  the world s biggest games publisher  had 9 games in the top 20.  2004 was a  stellar year  said roger bennett  director general of elspa.  in a year with no new generation consoles being released  the market continued to be buoyant as the industry matured and the increasingly diverse range of games reached new audiences and broadened its player base - across ages and gender   he said. part of the success of games in 2004 could be due to the fact that so many of them are sequels. 16 out of the top 20 titles were all follow-ups to established franchises or direct sequels to previously popular games. halo  the sims  driver  need for speed  fifa football  burnout were just a few that proved as popular as the original titles. despite this fondness for older games  doom 3 did not make it to the top 20. movie tie-ins also proved their worth in 2004. games linked to shrek  the incredibles  spider-man  harry potter and lord of the rings were all in the top 20. elspa noted that sales of xbox games rose 37.9% during the year. however  sony s playstation 2 was the top seller with 47% of the £1.34bn spent on games in 2004 used to buy titles for that console. despite winning awards and rave reviews half-life 2 did not appear in the list. this was because it was only released on pc and  compared to console titles  sold in relatively small numbers. also the novel distribution system adopted by developer valve meant that many players downloaded the title rather than travel to the shops to buy a copy. valve has yet to release figures which show how many copies of the game were sold in this way.,gangster domin game chart video game consol comput prove popular ever gamer spent £bn almost accord figur releas uk game industri trade bodi sale record smash top titl year gta san andrea player get job turn central charact cj crime bos game sell million copi first nine day sale feat make fast sell video game time uk although releas novemb sprawl stori gun gangster game beat strong competit year end sell million copi also record set number game achiev doubleplatinum statu sell copi five titl includ soni eyetoy play ea need speed underground manag feat accord figur compil charttrack entertain leisur softwar publish associ elspa electron art world big game publish game top stellar year say roger bennett director gener elspa year new gener consol releas market continu buoyant industri matur increasingli diver rang game reach new audienc broaden player base across age gender say part success game could due fact mani sequel top titl followup establish franchis direct sequel previous popular game halo sim driver need speed fifa footbal burnout prove popular origin titl despit fond old game doom make top movi tiein also prove worth game link shrek incred spiderman harri potter lord ring top elspa note sale xbox game rise year howev soni playstat top seller £bn spent game use buy titl consol despit win award rave review halflif appear list releas pc compar consol titl sell rel small number also novel distribut system adopt develop valv meant mani player download titl rather travel shop buy copi valv yet releas figur show mani copi game sell way
536,876,sun offers processing by the hour sun microsystems has launched a pay-as-you-go service which will allow customers requiring huge computing power to rent it by the hour.  sun grid costs users $1 (53p) for an hour s worth of processing and storage power on systems maintained by sun. so-called grid computing is the latest buzz phrase in a company which believes that computing capacity is as important a commodity as hardware and software. sun likened grid computing to the development of electricity.  the system could mature in the same way utilities such as electricity and water have developed  said sun s chief operating officer jonathan schwartz.  why build your own grid when you can use ours for a buck an hour   he asked in a webcast launching sun s quarterly network computing event in california. the company will have to persuade data centre managers to adopt a new model but it said it already had interest from customers in the oil  gas and financial services industries.  some of them want to book computing capacity of more than 5 000 processors each  sun said. mr schwartz ran a demonstration of the service  showing how data could be processed in a protein folding experiment. hundreds of servers were used simultaneously  working on the problem for a few seconds each.  although it only took a few seconds  the experiment cost $12 (£6.30) because it had used up 12 hour s worth of computing power. the sun grid relies on solaris  the operating system owned by sun. initially it will house the grid in existing premises and will use idle servers to test software before shipping it to customers. it has not said how much the system will cost to develop but it already has a rival in ibm  which argues that its capacity on-demand service is cheaper than that offered by sun.,sun offer process hour sun microsystem launch payasyougo servic allow custom requir huge comput power rent hour sun grid cost user p hour worth process storag power system maintain sun socal grid comput late buzz phrase compani believ comput capac import commod hardwar softwar sun liken grid comput develop electr system could matur way util electr water develop say sun chief oper offic jonathan schwartz build grid use buck hour ask webcast launch sun quarterli network comput event california compani persuad data centr manag adopt new model say alreadi interest custom oil ga financi servic industri want book comput capac processor sun say mr schwartz ran demonstr servic show data could process protein fold experi hundr server use simultan work problem second although take second experi cost £ use hour worth comput power sun grid reli solari oper system own sun initi hous grid exist premis use idl server test softwar ship custom say much system cost develop alreadi rival ibm argu capac ondemand servic cheaper offer sun
537,300,ireland surge past scots ireland maintained their six nations grand slam ambitions with an impressive victory over scotland at murrayfield.  hugo southwell s try gave the scots an early 8-0 lead but scores from locks malcolm o kelly and paul o connell put the visitors in command by half-time. a third try from wing denis hickie and third penalty from ronan o gara  who kicked 13 points  extended the lead. jon petrie scored a second try for scotland but late scores from john hayes and gavin duffy sealed victory. after two hard-earned away victories  eddie o sullivan  side can now look forward to welcoming england to lansdowne road in a fortnight. scotland will try to give their coach matt williams a first six nations victory when italy come to edinburgh  but they again struggled to turn pressure into points. the home side started with tremendous intensity and dominated territory and possession in the opening 10 minutes. a powerful charge from flanker jason white was carried on by ali hogg and when ireland conceded a penalty close to their own line  scotland kicked it to touch. the irish defence foiled the home side on that occasion  but a stray hand in a ruck allowed paterson to stroke over a penalty in the eighth minute.  if that was a paltry reward for their early pressure  scotland got the try they deserved when paterson s searing break and andy craig s pass sent southwell streaking to the right corner. paterson was off target with the conversion and fly-half dan parks then missed a presentable drop-goal attempt. ireland got themselves on the scoreboard with an o gara penalty and by the 24th minute the visitors were ahead. stuart grimes pulled down o kelly at a line-out  ireland kicked the penalty to touch and from the set-piece  the big lock was driven over by the rest of his pack.  o gara added the conversion and a further penalty  after shane horgan almost grabbed a second try from o gara s chip to the corner  only for the ball to spill from his hand. but ireland still delivered a hammer blow to scotland s hopes just before the interval. o connell - skipper in the absence of brian o driscoll - powered through parks  weak tackle after a free-kick from a scrummage to burrow over.  scotland suffered a further blow on the resumption when ireland flanker johnny o connor won another vital turnover  and o gara s basketball pass sent hickie over in the left corner. o gara converted and then thumped over a 40m penalty to give the visitors a commanding 28-8 advantage. scotland looked bereft of ideas but a half-break from paterson sparked them back to life just before the hour. stuart grimes won a line-out and a well-worked move saw petrie scuttle round the side of the ruck to dive over in the left corner. but it proved a false dawn  and ireland reasserted their authority in the final 10 minutes. peter stringer and o kelly combined to put giant prop hayes over in the right corner before replacement gavin duffy scorched away on the left  david humphreys adding the final flourish with a touchline conversion.  : c paterson;

543,80,khodorkovsky ally denies charges a close associate of former yukos boss mikhail khodorkovsky has told a court that fraud charges levelled against him are  false .  platon lebedev has been on trial alongside mr khodorkovsky since june in a case centring around the privatisation of a fertiliser firm. the pair claim they are being punished by the authorities for the political ambitions of mr khodorkovsky. mr lebedev said there were  absurd contradictions  in the case. opening his defence  he said he could not see the legal basis of the charges he faced  which also include allegations of tax evasion.  to my embarrassment  i could not understand the file of complaints against me   he told a moscow court. mr lebedev headed the menatep group  the parent company of yukos.  mr lebedev and mr khodorkovsky  who each face a possible 10 year jail sentence if convicted  will be questioned by a judge over the next few days. mr khodorkovsky began his testimony last week  telling the court that he objected to the way that the  running of a normal business has been presented as a work of criminal fiction . the charges are seen by supporters as politically motivated and part of a drive by russian president vladimir putin to rein in the country s super-rich business leaders  the so-called oligarchs. yukos has been presented with a $27.5bn (£13bn) tax demand by the russian authorities and its key yugansk division was auctioned off to part settle the bill. the company s effort to gain bankruptcy protection in the us - in a bid to win damages for the sale - were dismissed by a court in texas.,khodorkovski alli deni charg close associ former yuko bos mikhail khodorkovski told court fraud charg level fals platon lebedev trial alongsid mr khodorkovski sinc june case centr around privatis fertilis firm pair claim punish author polit ambit mr khodorkovski mr lebedev say absurd contradict case open defenc say could see legal basi charg face also includ alleg tax evas embarrass could understand file complaint told moscow court mr lebedev head menatep group parent compani yuko mr lebedev mr khodorkovski face possibl year jail sentenc convict question judg next day mr khodorkovski begin testimoni last week tell court object way run normal busi present work crimin fiction charg see support polit motiv part drive russian presid vladimir putin rein countri superrich busi leader socal oligarch yuko present bn £bn tax demand russian author key yugansk divis auction part settl bill compani effort gain bankruptci protect u bid win damag sale dismiss court texa
544,1361,call centre users  lose patience  customers trying to get through to call centres are getting impatient and quicker to hang up  a survey suggests.  once past the welcome message  callers on average hang up after just 65 seconds of listening to canned music. the drop in patience comes as the number of calls to call centres is growing at a rate of 20% every year.  customers are getting used to the idea of an  always available  society   says cara diemont of it firm dimension data  which commissioned the survey. however  call centres also saw a sharp increase of customers simply abandoning calls  she says  from just over 5% in 2003 to a record 13.3% during last year. when automated phone message systems are taken out of the equation  where customers have to pick their way through multiple options and messages  the number of abandoned calls is even higher - a sixth of all callers give up rather than wait. one possible reason for the lack in patience  ms diemont says  is the fact that more customers are calling  on the move  using their mobile phones.  the surge in customers trying to get through to call centres is also a reflection of the centres  growing range of tasks.  once a call centre may have looked after mortgages  now its agents may also be responsible for credit cards  insurance and current accounts   ms diemont says. problems are occurring because increased responsibility is not going hand-in-hand with more training  the survey found.  in what dimension data calls an  alarming development   the average induction time for a call centre worker fell last year from 36 to just 21 days  leaving  agents not equipped to deal with customers . this  ms diemont warns  is  scary  and not good for the bottom line either. poor training frustrates both call centre workers and customers. as a result  call centres have a high  churn rate   with nearly a quarter of workers throwing in the towel every year  which in turn forces companies to pay for training new staff. resolution rates - the number of calls where a customer s query is resolved to mutual satisfaction - are running at just 50%. when the query is passed on to a second or third person - a specialist or manager - rates rise to about 70%  but that is still well below the industry target of an 85% resolution rate.  suggestions that  outsourcing  - relocating call centres to low-cost countries like india or south africa - is to blame are wrong  ms diemont says.  there are  no big differences in wait time and call resolution  between call centres based in europe or north america and those in developing countries around the world.  you can make call centres perform anywhere if you have good management and the right processes in place   she says. however  companies that decide to  offshore  their operations are driven not just by cost considerations. only 42% of them say that saving money is the main consideration when closing domestic call centre operations. half of them argue that workers in other countries offer better skills for the money. but not everybody believes that outsourcing and offshoring are the solution. nearly two-thirds of all firms polled for the survey have no plans to offshore their call centres. they give three key reasons for not making the move:  - call centre operations are part of their business  core function     - they are worried about the risk of going abroad    - they fear that they will damage their brand if they join the offshoring drive. the survey was conducted by sunovate on behalf of dimension data  and is based on in-depth questionnaires of 166 call centres in 24 countries and five continents. what are your experiences with call centres  are you happy to listen to vivaldi or greensleeves  or do you want an immediate response  and if you work in a call centre: did your training prepare you for your job,call centr user lose patienc custom tri get call centr get impati quicker hang survey suggest past welcom messag caller averag hang second listen can music drop patienc come number call call centr grow rate everi year custom get use idea alway avail societi say cara diemont firm dimens data commiss survey howev call centr also saw sharp increas custom simpli abandon call say record last year autom phone messag system take equat custom pick way multipl option messag number abandon call even high sixth caller give rather wait one possibl reason lack patienc m diemont say fact custom call move use mobil phone surg custom tri get call centr also reflect centr grow rang task call centr may look mortgag agent may also respons credit card insur current account m diemont say problem occur increas respons go handinhand train survey found dimens data call alarm develop averag induct time call centr worker fell last year day leav agent equip deal custom m diemont warn scari good bottom line either poor train frustrat call centr worker custom result call centr high churn rate nearli quarter worker throw towel everi year turn forc compani pay train new staff resolut rate number call custom queri resolv mutual satisfact run queri pas second third person specialist manag rate rise still well industri target resolut rate suggest outsourc reloc call centr lowcost countri like india south africa blame wrong m diemont say big differ wait time call resolut call centr base europ north america develop countri around world make call centr perform anywher good manag right process place say howev compani decid offshor oper driven cost consider say save money main consider close domest call centr oper half argu worker countri offer well skill money everybodi believ outsourc offshor solut nearli twothird firm poll survey plan offshor call centr give three key reason make move call centr oper part busi core function worri risk go abroad fear damag brand join offshor drive survey conduct sunov behalf dimens data base indepth questionnair call centr countri five contin experi call centr happi listen vivaldi greensleev want immedi respons work call centr train prepar job
545,1916,no seasonal lift for house market a swathe of figures have provided further evidence of a slowdown in the uk property market.  the council of mortgage lenders (cml)  british bankers association (bba) and building societies association (bsa) all said mortgage lending was slowing. cml figures showed gross lending fell by 4% in november as the number of people buying new homes fell. elsewhere  the bba added underlying mortgage lending rose by £4m in november  compared to october s £4.29m. the cml said that loans for new property purchases fell 25% year-on-year to 85 000 - the lowest total seen since february 2003.  data from the cml showed lending fell to just over £25bn in november  from £25.5bn a year earlier. separate figures from the building societies association showed the value of mortgage approvals -- loans agreed but not yet made -- stood 32% lower than at the same time last year  at a seasonally-adjusted £2.98bn. the figures come hot on the heels of new data from property website rightmove which suggested owners must indulge in a  winter sale  and slash prices by up to 8%. miles shipside  commercial director at rightmove  said sellers would have to be  more realistic with their asking prices  to tempt buyers. the average asking price of a home fell by more than £600 from £190 329 in november to £189 733 in december  while the length of time it takes to sell a home rose to 81 days from 53 in the summer.  rightmove said estate agents were set to enter 2005 with a third more properties on their books than a year ago.  even once the quieter holiday period is over  sellers will find themselves competing with a lot of other properties on the market. in any business  excess supply and low demand means one thing - cut prices   mr shipside said.   the proof is that some properties that have been appropriately discounted are selling  even in the current market.  overall  asking prices have fallen 3.3% from their july peaks as the equivalent of £6 500 has been cut from an average property. a host of mortgage lenders and economists have predicted that property prices will either fall or stagnate in 2005.  what is apparent is a picture of a slowing market  but one that should remain stable as we return to more normal volumes of lending over 2005 as a whole   cml director general michael coogan said.  it s a fairly consistent picture  showing that mortgage demand has fallen back again  which is consistent with a continuing correction in the housing market   investec economist philip shaw said.  however  the figures do suggest only a modest weakening  and we stand by our view that the property market will remain in the doldrums for some time  though a collapse is still unlikely.,season lift hous market swath figur provid evid slowdown uk properti market council mortgag lender cml british banker associ bba build societi associ bsa say mortgag lend slow cml figur show gross lend fell novemb number peopl buy new home fell elsewher bba ad underli mortgag lend rise £m novemb compar octob £m cml say loan new properti purchas fell yearonyear low total see sinc februari data cml show lend fell £bn novemb £bn year earlier separ figur build societi associ show valu mortgag approv loan agre yet make stood low time last year seasonallyadjust £bn figur come hot heel new data properti websit rightmov suggest owner must indulg winter sale slash price mile shipsid commerci director rightmov say seller would realist ask price tempt buyer averag ask price home fell £ £ novemb £ decemb length time take sell home rise day summer rightmov say estat agent set enter third properti book year ago even quieter holiday period seller find compet lot properti market busi excess suppli low demand mean one thing cut price mr shipsid say proof properti appropri discount sell even current market overal ask price fall juli peak equival £ cut averag properti host mortgag lender economist predict properti price either fall stagnat appar pictur slow market one remain stabl return normal volum lend whole cml director gener michael coogan say fairli consist pictur show mortgag demand fall back consist continu correct hous market investec economist philip shaw say howev figur suggest modest weaken stand view properti market remain doldrum time though collaps still unlik
546,2214,progress on new internet domains by early 2005 the net could have two new domain names.  the .post and .travel net domains have been given preliminary approval by the net s administrative body. the names are just two of a total of 10 proposed domains that are being considered by the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers  icann. the other proposed names include a domain for pornography  asia  mobile phones  an anti-spam domain and one for the catalan language and culture.  the .post domain is backed by the universal postal union that wants to use it as the online marker for every type of postal service and to help co-ordinate the e-commerce efforts of national post offices.  the .travel domain would be used by hotels  travel firms  airlines  tourism offices and would help such organisations distinguish themselves online. it is backed by a new york-based trade group called the travel partnership. icann said its early decision on the two domains was in response to the detailed technical and commercial information the organisations behind the names had submitted. despite this initial approval  icann cautioned that there was no guarantee that the domains would actually go into service. at the same time icann is considering proposals for another eight domains. one that may not win approval is a proposal to set up a .xxx domain for pornographic websites. a similar proposal has been made many times in the past. but icann has been reluctant to approve it because of the difficulty of making pornographers sign up and use it. in 2000 icann approved seven other new domains that have had varying degrees of success. three of the new so-called top level domains were for specific industries or organisations such as .museum and .aero. others such as .info and .biz were intended to be more generic. in total there are in excess of 200 domain names and the majority of these are for nations. but domains that end in the .com suffix are by far the most numerous.,progress new internet domain earli net could two new domain name post travel net domain give preliminari approv net administr bodi name two total propos domain consid internet corpor assign name number icann propos name includ domain pornographi asia mobil phone antispam domain one catalan languag cultur post domain back univers postal union want use onlin marker everi type postal servic help coordin ecommerc effort nation post offic travel domain would use hotel travel firm airlin tourism offic would help organis distinguish onlin back new yorkbas trade group call travel partnership icann say earli decis two domain respons detail technic commerci inform organis behind name submit despit initi approv icann caution guarante domain would actual go servic time icann consid propos anoth eight domain one may win approv propos set xxx domain pornograph websit similar propos make mani time past icann reluct approv difficulti make pornograph sign use icann approv seven new domain vari degre success three new socal top level domain specif industri organis museum aero other info biz intend gener total excess domain name major nation domain end com suffix far numer

548,1600,britons fed up with net service a survey conducted by pc pro magazine has revealed that many britons are unhappy with their internet service.  they are fed up with slow speeds  high prices and the level of customer service they receive. 17% of readers have switched suppliers and a further 16% are considering changing in the near future. it is particularly bad news for bt  the uk s biggest internet supplier  with almost three times as many people trying to leave as joining.  a third of the 2 000 broadband users interviewed were fed up with their current providers but this could be just the tip of the iceberg thinks tim danton  editor of pc pro magazine.  we expect these figures to leap in 2005. every month the prices drop  and more and more people are trying to switch   he said. the survey found that bt and tiscali have been actively dissuading customers from leaving by offering them a lower price when they phone up to cancel their subscription. some readers were offered a price drop just 25p more expensive than that offered by an alternative operator  making it hardly worth while swapping.  other found themselves tied into 12-month contracts. broadband has become hugely competitive and providers are desperate to hold on to customers. 12% of those surveyed found themselves unable to swap at all.  we discovered a huge variety of problems  but one of the biggest issues is the current supplier withholding the information that people need to give to their new supplier   said tim danton  editor of pc pro.  this breaks the code of practice  but because that code is voluntary there s nothing we or ofcom can do to help   he said. there is a vast choice of internet service providers in the uk now and an often bewildering array of broadband packages. with prices set to drop even further in coming months mr danton advises everyone to shop around carefully.  if you just stick with your current connection then there s every chance you re being ripped off   he warned.,briton fed net servic survey conduct pc pro magazin reveal mani briton unhappi internet servic fed slow speed high price level custom servic receiv reader switch supplier consid chang near futur particularli bad news bt uk big internet supplier almost three time mani peopl tri leav join third broadband user interview fed current provid could tip iceberg think tim danton editor pc pro magazin expect figur leap everi month price drop peopl tri switch say survey found bt tiscali activ dissuad custom leav offer low price phone cancel subscript reader offer price drop p expens offer altern oper make hardli worth swap found tie month contract broadband becom huge competit provid desper hold custom survey found unabl swap discov huge varieti problem one big issu current supplier withhold inform peopl need give new supplier say tim danton editor pc pro break code practic code voluntari noth ofcom help say vast choic internet servic provid uk often bewild array broadband packag price set drop even come month mr danton advis everyon shop around care stick current connect everi chanc rip warn
549,1382,millions to miss out on the net by 2025  40% of the uk s population will still be without internet access at home  says a study.  around 23 million britons will miss out on a wide range of essential services such as education and medical information  predicts the report by telecoms giant bt. it compares to 27 million  or 50%  of the uk  who are not currently online. the idea that the digital divide will evaporate with time is  wishful thinking   the report concludes.  the study calls on the government and telecoms industry to come up with new ways to lure those that have been bypassed by the digital revolution. although the percentage of britons without home access will have fallen slightly  those that remain digital refuseniks will miss out on more  the report suggests. as more and more everyday tasks move online and offline services become less comprehensive  the divide will become more obvious and more burdensome for those that have not got net access  it predicts.  the gap between  have-nets  and  have-nots  has been much talked about  but predictions about how such a divide will affect future generations has been less discussed. bt set out to predict future patterns based on current information and taking account of the way technology is changing. optimists who predict that convergence and the emergence of more user-friendly technology will bridge the digital divide could be way off mark  the report suggests.  internet access on other devices tends to be something taken up by those who already have it   said adrian hosford  director of corporate responsibility at bt. costs of internet access have fallen dramatically and coverage in remote areas have vastly improved over the last year but the real barrier remains psychological.  there is a hard rump of have-nots who are not engaging with the net. they don t have the motivation or skills or perceive the benefits   said mr hosford.  as now  the most disadvantaged groups are likely to remain among low income families  the older generation and the disabled.  those on low incomes will account for a quarter of the digital have-nots  the disabled will make up 16% and the elderly nearly a third by 2025  the report forecasts. organisations such as bt have a responsibility to help tackle the problem  said mr hosford. the telco has seen positive results with its everybody online project which offers internet access to people in eight deprived communities around britain. in one area of cornwall with high levels of unemployment  online training helped people rewrite cvs and learn skills to get new jobs  explained mr hosford. such grassroot activity addressing the specific needs of individual communities is essential is the problem of the digital divide is to be overcome  he said.  if we don t address this problem now  it will get a lot worse and people will find it more difficult to find jobs  education opportunities will be limited and they ll simply not be able to keep up with society   he said. the alliance for digital inclusion  an independent body with members drawn from government  industry and the voluntary sector has recently been set up to tackle some of the issues faced by the digital refuseniks.,million miss net uk popul still without internet access home say studi around million briton miss wide rang essenti servic educ medic inform predict report

550,2131,ibm puts cash behind linux push ibm is spending $100m (£52m) over the next three years beefing up its commitment to linux software.  the cash injection will be used to help its customers use linux on every type of device from handheld computers and phones right up to powerful servers. ibm said the money will fund a variety of technical  research and marketing initiatives to boost linux use. ibm said it had taken the step in response to greater customer demand for the open source software.  in 2004 ibm said it had seen double digit growth in the number of customers using linux to help staff work together more closely. the money will be used to help this push towards greater collaboration and will add linux-based elements to ibm s workplace software. workplace is a suite of programs and tools that allow workers to get at core business applications no matter what device they use to connect to corporate networks. one of the main focuses of the initiative will be to make it easier to use linux-based desktop computers and mobile devices with workplace. even before ibm announced this latest spending boost it was one of the biggest advocates of the open source way of working. in 2001 it put $300m into a three-year linux program and has produced linux versions of many of its programs. linux and the open source software movement are based on the premise that developers should be free to tinker with the core components of software programs. they reason that more open scrutiny of software produces better programs and fuels innovation.,ibm put cash behind linux push ibm spend m £m next three year beef commit linux softwar cash inject use help custom use linux everi type devic handheld comput phone right power server ibm say money fund varieti technic research market initi boost linux use ibm say take step respons great custom demand open sourc softwar ibm say see doubl digit growth number custom use linux help staff work togeth close money use help push toward great collabor add linuxbas element ibm workplac softwar workplac suit program tool allow worker get core busi applic matter devic use connect corpor network one main focus initi make easy use linuxbas desktop comput mobil devic workplac even ibm announc late spend boost one big advoc open sourc way work put m threeyear linux program produc linux version mani program linux open sourc softwar movement base premis develop free tinker core compon softwar program reason open scrutini softwar produc well program fuel innov
551,1990,hodgson shoulders england blame fly-half charlie hodgson admitted his wayward kicking played a big part in england s 18-17 defeat to france.  hodgson failed to convert three penalties and also missed a relatively easy drop goal attempt which would have given england a late win.  i m very disappointed with the result and with my myself   hodgson said.  it is very hard to take but it s something i will have to get through and come back stronger. my training s been good but it just didn t happen.  hodgson revealed that olly barkley had taken three penalties because they were  out of my range  but the centre could not convert his opportunities either  particularly the drop goal late on.  it wasn t a good strike   he added.  i felt as soon as it hit my boot it had missed. it s very disappointing  but i must recover.  andy robinson said he would  keep working on the kicking  with his squad. however  the england coach added that he would take some positives from the defeat.   we went out to play and played some very good rugby and what have france done   he said.  they won the game from kicking penalties from our 10m line.  it s very frustrating. the lads showed a lot of ambition in the first half  they went out to sustain it in the second but couldn t build on it.  we took the ball into contact  and you know when you do that it is a lottery whether the referee is going to give the penalty to your side or the other side.  we have lost a game we should have won. there is a fine line between winning and losing  and for the second week we ve been on the wrong side of that line and it hurts.   england went in at half-time with a 17-6 lead but they failed to score in the second half and dimitri yachvili slotted over four penalties as france overhauled the deficit. england skipper jason robinson admitted his side failed to cope with france s improved second-half display.   we controlled the game in the first half but we knew that they would come out and try everything after half-time   he said.  we made a lot of mistakes in the second half and they punished us. they took their chances when they came.  it s very disappointing. last week we lost by two points  now one point.,hodgson shoulder england blame flyhalf charli hodgson admit wayward kick play big part england defeat franc hodgson fail convert three penalti also miss rel easi drop goal attempt would give england late win disappoint result hodgson say hard take someth get come back strong train good happen hodgson reveal olli barkley take three penalti rang centr could convert opportun either particularli drop goal late good strike ad felt soon hit boot miss disappoint must recov andi robinson say would keep work kick squad howev england coach ad would take posit defeat go play play good rugbi franc do say game kick penalti m line frustrat lad show lot ambit first half go sustain second build take ball contact know lotteri whether refere go give penalti side side lose game fine line win lose second week wrong side line hurt england go halftim lead fail score second half dimitri yachvili slot four penalti franc overhaul deficit england skipper jason robinson admit side fail cope franc improv secondhalf display control game first half knew would come tri everyth halftim say make lot mistak second half punish u take chanc come disappoint last week lose two point one point
552,1877,blair joins school sailing trip the prime minister has donned a life jacket and joined school children in a sailing dinghy as he sought to sell his party s education policies.  tony blair sailed across the lake in bromsgrove  worcestershire  while on a visit with education secretary ruth kelly to back school outings. mr blair later stressed labour s election pledge to focus on education  when he met parents in the area. the conservatives and lib dems both say his pledges are  worthless . all the parties are stepping up campaigning ahead of a general election widely expected to be held on 5 may. mr blair  looking a little windswept  joined two girls from st egwin s middle school in evesham and an instructor for a trip in the wayfarer dinghy  closely followed by a boat full of photographers.  afterwards he said outdoor activities were beneficial for children but accepted that lots of teachers now worried about taking part for fear of being sued if something went wrong.  what we re doing is introducing some simple guidelines so if teachers follow those they are not going to be at risk of legal action   mr blair said.  when you are doing these types of activities you ve got to exercise some common sense there obviously.  you can t have a situation where parents or teachers end up being worried that they re going to be subject to all sorts of legal action if they take children sailing or doing outdoor activity that is actually good for the kids and good for their health and their character.   the pledge on education -  your child achieving more  - was one of six election pledges unveiled by mr blair last week. if it wins a third term in the general election expected this year  labour is committed to giving parents more choice between schools; allowing all secondary schools to take on specialist status; opening 200 city academies and creating 100 000 more sixth-form places. it aims to improve discipline in schools by adopting a  zero tolerance  approach to disruption of classes and introducing fixed penalty notices for truants. labour also plans to give head teachers at groups of local schools control over funding for units to handle disruptive pupils.  parents and teachers who met mr blair on tuesday were invited to the informal discussion after writing to their mps to raise concerns about education. it is the latest in a series of events designed to show the prime minister is speaking directly to voters in the run-up to the election - and that he has not lost touch. for the conservatives  shadow education secretary tim collins said:  mr blair&#191;s government is all talk. he must be judged on what he has done in two terms  not what he mendaciously claims he would do in a third. that judgment will be damning.  the liberal democrats are promising to cut class sizes for the youngest children and ensure all children are taught by a qualified teacher in each subject.,blair join school sail trip prime minist don life jacket join school child sail dinghi sought sell parti educ polici toni blair sail across lake bromsgrov worcestershir visit educ secretari ruth kelli back school out mr blair later stress labour elect pledg focu educ met parent area conserv lib dem say pledg worthless parti step campaign ahead gener elect wide expect held may mr blair look littl windswept join two girl st egwin middl school evesham instructor trip wayfar dinghi close follow boat full photograph afterward say outdoor activ benefici child accept lot teacher worri take part fear su someth go wrong introduc simpl guidelin teacher follow go risk legal action mr blair say type activ get exercis common sen obvious situat parent teacher end worri go subject sort legal action take child sail outdoor activ actual good kid good health charact pledg educ child achiev one six elect pledg unveil mr blair last week win third term gener elect expect year labour commit give parent choic school allow secondari school take specialist statu open citi academi creat sixthform place aim improv disciplin school adopt zero toler approach disrupt class introduc fix penalti notic truant labour also plan give head teacher group local school control fund unit handl disrupt pupil parent teacher met mr blair tuesday invit inform discus write mp rais concern educ late seri event design show prime minist speak directli voter runup elect lose touch conserv shadow educ secretari tim collin say mr blair govern talk must judg do two term mendaci claim would third judgment damn liber democrat promis cut class size young child ensur child taught qualifi teacher subject
553,228,all black magic: new zealand rugby playing colours:  all black  the haka and more!  the all blacks  charles john munro discovered rugby at london s christ college  and on his return to nelson he staged new zealand s first game. nelson town met nelson college on 14 may  1870  the town triumphing by two goals to nil  instigating a game that would become a national obsession and come to dominate the country s sporting passions. the game appealed to the kiwi psyche and quickly spread  the native maoris finding a particular empathy with the sport s warrior ethos. in 1888 a british team led by ae stoddart toured new zealand and australia  and soon after a maori named joe warbrick and an english ex-pat called thomas eyton decided to gather a combined new zealand team.  twenty-two maori and four  pakiha  formed the  new zealand native team   who played a total of 107 matches in new zealand  australia and the uk. the integration of white and maori was a reflecion of enlightened new zealand rugby and society  even if the british press were somewhat mystified by the pre-match tradition of the maori war dance  the haka! the other great symbol of new zealand rugby  the all black kit with the silver fern on the breast  was proposed by tom ellison at the first annual meeting of the new zealand rugby football union in 1893. new zealand played their first international against australia in 1903  the kiwis triumphing 22-3 in sydney  and the following year an official british touring team came to new zealand for the first time. the tourists had gone through australia undefeated but their captain  david revell bedell-sivright  created animosity in new zealand with his patronising attitude. the kiwis shocked the rugby world with a 9-3 triumph in wellington  sparking great celebrations across the country  but bedell-sivright churlishly suggested that the victors would have no chance when they visited the uk.  their opportunity to prove him wrong came in 1905 with the first official new zealand tour to europe. the tourists won their early games with a quick-thinking  inventive approach  but press criticism began to grow over their 2-3-2 scrum formation that left a  roving  forward free to disrupt opposition attacks. the tactic was effective  two late tries seeing the kiwis to a 12-7 win over scotland  before ireland were despatched 15-0 in dublin. a huge crowd at crystal palace convulsed with laughter at the sight of the haka - but the smiles were soon wiped from their faces when the tourists ran in five tries in a 15-0 hammering of england. new zealand headed to wales to meet a country in the midst of its first  golden age   and the encounter would be the first in a series of controversial clashes between the sides. an excellent try on the left wing by teddy morgan sealed a 3-0 win in a hard-fought encounter at cardiff arms park  but post-match talk was dominated by a bob deans try that was ruled out by scottish referee john dallas. dallas said that deans was tackled short  but the kiwi said he was dragged back into the field of play after grounding a try - on his death-bed three years later he exclaimed:  i did score that try in cardiff.   four of the 1905 all blacks went over to the newly formed  all golds  rugby league side soon after the tour  but new zealand were strong enough to crush an anglo-welsh touring team in 1908. the first south africa tour of new zealand in 1921 saw honours shared in a three-test series  starting the greatest rivalry in rugby - and the long-running controversy between the countries over the all blacks  inclusion of maori players. the awesome 1924-5 all black tourists became known as  the invincibles  after winning all 30 of their games in france  britain and ireland  including a crushing 19-0 victory over wales at st helen s. despite their success  the all blacks  2-3-2 scrum formation left them somewhat short of possession at times  and the flaws were exploited by the springboks in south africa in 1928. employing the modern 3-4-1 scrum line-up against the new zealand  rover  system for the first time  south african teams defeated the all blacks in five games and the test series was drawn two-all. the controversial new zealand scrum method finally disappeared after the 1930 lions tour (a series won 3-1 by new zealand)  the lions manager describing the tactic as  cheating   prompting the international rugby board to rule that three men had to pack down in the front row of the scrum.  the all blacks  1935 european tour started inauspiciously with an 11-3 loss to a swansea side inspired by teenage  schoolboy half-backs hayden tanner and willie davies. a thrilling test at cardiff arms park went to wales 13-12  although the winning try from geoffrey rees-jones was controversial following an illegal claude davey tackle in the build-up. new zealand s next visit to wales in 1953 proved difficult as they lost 8-3 to cardiff and drew 6-6 at swansea. the all blacks were on top in the test with wales at the arms park  but the teams were locked at 8-8 when a clem thomas cross kick was gathered by ken jones for a famous  match-winning try. the tourists made some amends with wins over the other home nations  before a 19-5 success over the barbarians in an arms park thriller. new zealand built from that tour  and by the time they returned in 1963-4 they were undoubtedly the leading side in the world.  that made the shock all the greater when a drop goal by student john uzzell gave newport an unlikely 3-0 win over the tourists at rodney parade. wilson whinneray s side rallied to beat wales 6-0  their first win at the arms park in four attempts  and went unbeaten through the rest of the tour  but when they returned home the first question put to them was:  what happened in newport   the only blemish on the record of the awesome 1967 tourists was a draw with east wales  as they beat the full wales team 13-6 in cardiff to take the lead in the series between the countries for the first time. that lead was increased with two comfortable wins for the home side in new zealand in 1969  the first time wales had toured the country as an independent team.  a ferocious game at the arms park in 1972 was edged 19-16 by the all blacks  a measure of revenge for the defeat inflicted on new zealand by the carwyn james-inspired lions of 1971.  james guided llanelli to a famous 9-3 win over the tourists at stradey park  though  and in the final game of the tour the barbarians defeated the all blacks 23-11 in cardiff in a game regarded by many as the greatest ever played. new zealand defeated a wales xv 12-3 at the arms park in a non-cap game in 1974  but it was the 1978 game in cardiff that would reignite the history of controversy between the two countries.  wales were leading 12-10 with one minute left when andy haden flew to the floor from a line-out. television pictures clearly showed that he dived  but english referee roger quittenton was fooled and awarded a penalty  duly converted by brian mckechnie for a 13-12 win. since that infamous game  the competition has largely left wales v new zealand fixtures as the men in red have slipped from the pinnacle of the world game. a crushing 23-3 win for new zealand in cardiff in the welsh rugby union s 1980 centenary game was a sign of things to come. the new professionalism in the southern hemisphere game that had left europe behind was shown as the all blacks swatted wales aside 49-6 in brisbane in the semi-final of the inaugural world cup. the kiwis went on to claim the cup  and would inflict further misery on wales on their ill-fated 1988 tour of new zealand.  a young  talented wales side left britain full of confidence as triple crown winners  but one of the greatest ever new zealand teams demolished them 52-3 and 54-9. after also taking some fearful beatings in the provincial games  wales captain jonathan davies returned home calling for urgent change in the national game  but as his views were ignored he - along with a generation of wales  best players - chose to head north to rugby league.  a 34-9 win in cardiff followed for new zealand in 1989  and at the 1995 world cup wales  big talk was made to look embarrassing as the all blacks eased to victory in johannesburg. a crushing 42-7 kiwi triumph in wembley followed in 1997  and as wales  misery increased they turned to new zealand for their salvation in the shape of coaches graham henry and steve hansen. there was a temporary resurgence in the welsh game  but when an experimental new zealand side came to cardiff s new millennium stadium in 2002 they left with a 43-17 victory.  a bruising 55-3 defeat followed for wales in hamilton in 2003 as hansen built towards the world cup  but in australia it was a remarkable performance against the all blacks that gave his side renewed hope. wales were given no chance going into the game  but in the course of the match they rediscovered the value of attacking flair to lead 37-33 early in the second half. new zealand rallied to a 53-37 win  but the style shown by wales has been used as an inspiration as they look to a better future. they now face an all blacks team led by henry and hansen  coming to europe with a weakened squad at the end of a long season. an encouraging display against south africa has inspired a confident wales camp to believe they can claim their first win over the men in black for over 50 years. they have a chance  but clearly history is not on their side.,black magic new zealand rugbi

555,363,japanese growth grinds to a halt growth in japan evaporated in the three months to september  sparking renewed concern about an economy not long out of a decade-long trough.  output in the period grew just 0.1%  an annual rate of 0.3%. exports - the usual engine of recovery - faltered  while domestic demand stayed subdued and corporate investment also fell short. the growth falls well short of expectations  but does mark a sixth straight quarter of expansion.  the economy had stagnated throughout the 1990s  experiencing only brief spurts of expansion amid long periods in the doldrums. one result was deflation - prices falling rather than rising - which made japanese shoppers cautious and kept them from spending.  the effect was to leave the economy more dependent than ever on exports for its recent recovery. but high oil prices have knocked 0.2% off the growth rate  while the falling dollar means products shipped to the us are becoming relatively more expensive.  the performance for the third quarter marks a sharp downturn from earlier in the year. the first quarter showed annual growth of 6.3%  with the second showing 1.1%  and economists had been predicting as much as 2% this time around.  exports slowed while capital spending became weaker   said hiromichi shirakawa  chief economist at ubs securities in tokyo.  personal consumption looks good  but it was mainly due to temporary factors such as the olympics.  the amber light is flashing.  the government may now find it more difficult to raise taxes  a policy it will have to implement when the economy picks up to help deal with japan s massive public debt.,japanes growth grind halt growth japan evapor three month septemb spark renew concern economi long decadelong trough output period grow annual rate export usual engin recoveri falter domest demand stay subdu corpor invest also fell short growth fall well short expect mark sixth straight quarter expans economi stagnat throughout s experienc brief spurt expans amid long period doldrum one result deflat price fall rather rise make japanes shopper cautiou kept spend effect leav economi depend ever export recent recoveri high oil price knock growth rate fall dollar mean product ship u becom rel expens perform third quarter mark sharp downturn earlier year first quarter show annual growth second show economist predict much time around export slow capit spend becam weaker say hiromichi shirakawa chief economist ub secur tokyo person consumpt look good mainli due temporari factor olymp amber light flash govern may find difficult rais tax polici implement economi pick help deal japan massiv public debt
556,1534,uk rebate  unjustified  - chirac french president jacques chirac has called the uk s £3bn rebate from the european union  unjustified .  speaking after a summit meeting he said unless it was put up for discussion the eu would never be able to reach agreement on its medium term finances. earlier foreign secretary jack straw said the uk was prepared to veto any bid to reduce the rebate secured by margaret thatcher in 1984. he said it remained justified because less eu farm money came to the uk.  mr chirac told reporters in brussels:  one can only have a reasonable budgetary balance if we put back on the table the british cheque. it can no longer be justified. it was from the past.  but a uk government official responded:  even with the rebate  the uk pays two and a half times more than france contributes to the eu budget. without it we would pay 14 times as much as france.  there can be no deal on future financing which does not protect the rebate.   the 25-member eu is gearing up for tough negotiations on its budget plans for the period 2007-2013  with the bloc s luxembourg presidency hoping to strike a deal at a june summit. earlier conservative graham brady said the rebate was a  crucial test  of how firmly ministers were prepared to stand up for britain. eu commission president jose manuel barroso has indicated he wants the rebate to come to an end. mr straw said that as well as the veto over the rebate the uk wanted to keep a tight rein on national contributions.  the uk  france  germany  austria  the netherlands and sweden want the eu budget to be capped at 1% of member states  combined national incomes - the european commission has urged an increase to 1.26%. mr straw has said the eu commission s proposal would mean a 35% hike in the budget. shadow europe minister mr brady said:  i believe it is essential that britain keeps the rebate and i think it s a crucial test of how firmly the british government is prepared to stand up for britain internationally in europe.   the uk is already one of the biggest net contributors to the eu .  the foreign secretary meanwhile said the  justice  of the rebate remained.  we have one of the lowest net receipts of any eu country because of the relatively small size of our agriculture sector and its efficiency.  that continues to be the case.   uk independence party leader roger knapman said the rebate was  set in stone  and there was no reason to negotiate about it.  it is extraordinary to do it at this time  just as we are becoming the biggest contributor to the eu. if we lose our rebate as well  the british taxpayer is going to be bled at such a rate that i think everyone will go off the european project.  eu leaders are holding talks in brussels on how to re-energise the sluggish european economy. uk prime minister tony blair is meeting his eu counterparts to finalise a package of measures aimed at stimulating growth and boosting employment ahead of a series of referendums on the european constitution. the plans could introduce a free market into everything from computer services to construction. critics - including germany and france - believe liberalisation could result in companies shifting staff to cheaper bases in eastern europe  undercutting large eu economies and undermining social protections. there are also concerns about the number of workers from eastern european countries who will head west  exacerbating the already high unemployment levels in germany.  mr straw insisted there was nothing to fear from the services directorate.  european countries overall have benefited hugely from the free market in goods   he said.  what we are now talking about is developing that market into an internal market in services.  britain s low unemployment meant there was less  neurosis  about people coming from eastern european countries.  in countries like germany and france  where frankly because of a tighter social market they have much higher levels of unemployment  there is increasing anxiety about other people coming in   he said.,uk rebat unjustifi chirac french presid jacqu chirac call uk £bn rebat european union unjustifi speak summit meet say unless put discus eu would never abl reach agreement medium term financ earlier foreign secretari jack straw say uk prepar veto bid reduc rebat secur margaret thatcher say remain justifi less eu farm money come uk mr chirac told report brussel one reason budgetari balanc put back tabl british chequ longer justifi past uk govern offici respond even rebat uk pay two half time franc contribut eu budget without would pay time much franc deal futur financ protect rebat member eu gear tough negoti budget plan period bloc luxembourg presid hope strike deal june summit earlier conserv graham bradi say rebat crucial test firmli minist prepar stand britain eu commiss presid jose manuel barroso indic want rebat come end mr straw say well veto rebat uk want keep tight rein nation contribut uk franc germani austria netherland sweden want eu budget cap member state combin nation incom european commiss urg increas mr straw say eu commiss propos would mean hike budget shadow europ minist mr bradi say believ essenti britain keep rebat think crucial test firmli british govern prepar stand britain intern europ uk alreadi one big net contributor eu foreign secretari meanwhil say justic rebat remain one low net receipt eu countri rel small size agricultur sector effici continu case uk independ parti leader roger knapman say rebat set stone reason negoti extraordinari time becom big contributor eu lose rebat well british taxpay go bleed rate think everyon go european project eu leader hold talk brussel reenergis sluggish european economi uk prime minist toni blair meet eu counterpart finalis packag measur aim stimul growth boost employ ahead seri referendum european constitut plan could introduc free market everyth comput servic construct critic includ germani franc believ liberalis could result compani shift staff cheaper base eastern europ undercut larg eu economi undermin social protect also concern number worker eastern european countri head west exacerb alreadi high unemploy level germani mr straw insist noth fear servic director european countri overal benefit huge free market good say talk develop market intern market servic britain low unemploy meant less neurosi peopl come eastern european countri countri like germani franc frankli tighter social market much high level unemploy increas anxieti peopl come say
557,906,bets off after big brother  leak  a bookmaker has stopped taking bets on celebrity big brother after claiming  sensitive information  about the channel 4 show had been leaked.  william hill made the move after four people tried to place bets on friday s surprise double eviction.  this is highly unlikely to have been an inspired guess   william hill spokesman rupert adams said. however  a big brother spokeswoman was  satisfied  that sensitive information about the show remained confidential.  the bookmaker said its suspicions had been aroused by betting for the last two contestant evictions  when people were still trying to place large sums despite odds as short as 1/14. but william hill s  overwhelming evidence  came on friday when four unknown callers asked to place bets on the show s surprise double eviction.  shortly afterwards model caprice and actor jeremy edwards left the show. mr adams believed someone had gained access to figures which revealed how viewers were voting  and was using them to predict which celebrity would be evicted next.  we think somebody somewhere has got them and has been trying very hard to take us to the cleaners   he said. the bets were not taken. mr adams did not believe anyone from channel 4 or big brother producer endemol had tried to place the queried bets. but he added:  they need to look at how many people are privy to the sensitive information.   big brother s spokeswoman said:  only a handful of senior production executives are privy to any sensitive information regarding eviction voting and there are strict procedures in place to keep this information strictly confidential.  we do not feel the need to investigate this further as we are satisfied that these measures are effective.  the show s independent adjudicator - the electoral reform services - was also satisfied  she added. the current series of celebrity big brother ends on sunday  with happy mondays star bez  actress brigitte nielsen and blazin  squad rapper kenzie competing for a £50 000 charity prize.  bookmaker ladbrokes said it would continue to accept bets on the final  with kenzie its favourite at 2/9.  we felt no need whatsoever to close the book   spokesman warren lush said.  we ve seen absolutely no suspicious betting patterns.  mr lush added that people sometimes vote on short odds  because they think it s like buying money .  you do have to risk quite a lot of money for a very small gain but if they think there s no chance of an upset they will still do it   he said.,bet big brother leak bookmak stop take bet celebr big brother claim sensit inform channel show leak william hill make move four peopl tri place bet friday surpris doubl evict highli unlik inspir guess william hill spokesman rupert adam say howev big brother spokeswoman satisfi sensit inform show remain confidenti bookmak say suspicion arous bet last two contest evict peopl still tri place larg sum despit odd short william hill overwhelm evid come friday four unknown caller ask place bet show surpris doubl evict shortli afterward model capric actor jeremi edward left show mr adam believ someon gain access figur reveal viewer vote use predict celebr would evict next think somebodi somewher get tri hard take u cleaner say bet take mr adam believ anyon channel big brother produc endemol tri place queri bet ad need look mani peopl privi sensit inform big brother spokeswoman say hand senior product execut privi sensit inform regard evict vote strict procedur place keep inform strictli confidenti feel need investig satisfi measur effect show independ adjud elector reform servic also satisfi ad current seri celebr big brother end sunday happi monday star bez actress brigitt nielsen blazin squad rapper kenzi compet £ chariti prize bookmak ladbrok say would continu accept bet final kenzi favourit felt need whatsoev close book spokesman warren lush say see absolut suspici bet pattern mr lush ad peopl sometim vote short odd think like buy money risk quit lot money small gain think chanc upset still say

559,1527,uk will stand firm on eu rebate  britain s £3bn eu rebate is not up for renegotiation at next week s european council summit  jack straw said.  the foreign secretary told mps the rebate  secured by margaret thatcher in 1984  was  entirely justified . new european commission president jose manuel barroso has suggested the cash could be shared out among net contributors to the eu budget. mr straw acknowledged some countries in the newly enlarged 25 nation eu still had to  see the light  on the rebate.  but the foreign secretary told the commons foreign affairs committee:  our position is very clear: it is entirely justified and it is not for negotiation.  he added that he did not think there would be a political price to pay for the uk s stance - britain contributed more and received less than other eu states. the two-day european council summit in brussels begins on 16 december and is widely expected to mark the beginning of a lengthy negotiating period over the eu s budget for 2007-13. the wrangling could stretch into 2005  even 2006.  the uk  france  germany  austria  the netherlands and sweden want the eu budget to be capped at 1% of member states  combined national incomes - the commission wants it to be 1.26%. mr straw said the eu commission s proposal would mean a 35% hike in the budget.  i don t know of any national government thinking of increasing its budget by that amount   he added. the foreign secretary said he hoped the talks next week could produce a date in 2005 for the beginning of negotiations with turkey about possible eu membership although that there would be no prospect of a date for joining for some time.,uk stand firm eu rebat britain £bn eu rebat renegoti next week european council summit jack straw say foreign secretari told mp rebat secur margaret thatcher entir justifi new european commiss presid jose manuel barroso suggest cash could share among net contributor eu budget mr straw acknowledg countri newli enlarg nation eu still see light rebat foreign secretari told common foreign affair committe posit clear entir justifi negoti ad think would polit price pay uk stanc britain contribut receiv less eu state twoday european council summit brussel begin decemb wide expect mark begin lengthi negoti period eu budget wrangl could stretch even uk franc germani austria netherland sweden want eu budget cap member state combin nation incom commiss want mr straw say eu commiss propos would mean hike budget know nation govern think increas budget amount ad foreign secretari say hope talk next week could produc date begin negoti turkey possibl eu membership although would prospect date join time

562,66,broadband in the uk growing fast high-speed net connections in the uk are proving more popular than ever.  bt reports that more people signed up for broadband in the last three months than in any other quarter. the 600 000 connections take the total number of people in the uk signing up for broadband from bt to almost 3.3 million. nationally more than 5 million browse the net via broadband. britain now has among the highest number of broadband connections throughout the whole of europe.  according to figures gathered by industry watchdog  ofcom  the growth means that the uk has now surpassed germany in terms of broadband users per 100 people. the uk total of 5.3 million translates into 7.5 connections per 100 people  compared to 6.7 in germany and 15.8 in the netherlands. the numbers of people signing up to broadband include those that get their service direct from bt or via the many companies that re-sell bt lines under their own name. part of the surge in people signing up was due to bt stretching the reach of adsl - the uk s most widely used way of getting broadband - beyond 6km.  asymmetric digital subscriber line technology lets ordinary copper phone lines support high data speeds. the standard speed is 512kbps  though faster connections are available.  this breakthrough led to a dramatic increase in orders as we were suddenly able to satisfy the pent-up demand that existed in many areas   said paul reynolds  chief executive of bt wholesale which provides phone lines that other firms re-sell. bt retail  which sells net services under its own name  also had a good quarter and provided about 30% of the new broadband customers. this was a slight increase on the previous three months. despite the good news about growth in broadband  figures from telecommunications regulator ofcom show that bt faces increasing competition  and dwindling influence  in other sectors. local loop unbundling  (llu)  in which bt rivals install their hardware in exchanges and take over the line to a customer s home or office  is growing steadily. cable & wireless and ntl have announced that they are investing millions to start offering llu services. by the end of september more than 4.2 million phone lines were using so-called carrier pre-section (cps) services  such as talktalk and one.tel  which route phone calls across non-bt networks from a local exchange. there are now more than 300 different firms offering cps services and the percentage of people using bt lines for voice calls has shrunk to 55.4%.,broadband uk grow fast highspe net connect uk prove popular ever bt report peopl sign broadband last three month quarter connect take total number peopl uk sign broadband bt almost million nation million brow net via broadband britain among high number broadband connect throughout whole europ accord figur gather industri watchdog ofcom growth mean uk surpass germani term broadband user per peopl uk total million translat connect per peopl compar germani netherland number peopl sign broadband includ get servic direct bt via mani compani resel bt line name part surg peopl sign due bt stretch reach adsl uk wide use way get broadband beyond km asymmetr digit subscrib line technolog let ordinari copper phone line support high data speed standard speed kbp though faster connect avail breakthrough lead dramat increas order suddenli abl satisfi pentup demand exist mani area say paul reynold chief execut bt wholesal provid phone line firm resel bt retail sell net servic name also good quarter provid new broadband custom slight increas previou three month despit good news growth broadband figur telecommun regul ofcom show bt face increas competit dwindl influenc sector local loop unbundl llu bt rival instal hardwar exchang take line custom home offic grow steadili cabl wireless ntl announc invest million start offer llu servic end septemb million phone line use socal carrier presect cp servic talktalk onetel rout phone call across nonbt network local exchang differ firm offer cp servic percentag peopl use bt line voic call shrunk

564,926,man utd to open books to glazer manchester united s board has agreed to give us tycoon malcolm glazer access to its books.  earlier this month  mr glazer presented the board with detailed proposals on an offer to buy the football club. in a statement  the club said it would allow mr glazer  limited due diligence  to give him the opportunity to take the proposal on to a formal bid. but it said it continued to oppose mr glazer s plans  calling his assumptions  aggressive  and his plan  damaging . many of manchester united s supporters own shares in the club  and the fan-based group shareholders united is strongly opposed to any takeover by mr glazer. about 300 fans protested outside the old trafford ground two days ago.  rival local club manchester city has pleaded with visiting fans not to protest inside its ground when the two teams play a televised match on sunday.  manchester united s response comes as little surprise  as the board made clear.  any board has a responsibility to consider a bona fide offer proposal   the club said in its statement. should it become a firm offer  it should be at a price that  the board is likely to regard as fair  and on terms which  may be deliverable . but it also stressed that it stayed opposed to mr glazer s proposal.  the board continues to believe that mr glazer s business plan assumptions are aggressive   the statement said   and the direct and indirect financial strain on the business could be damaging.  whether or not the bid is attractive in monetary terms  in the case of manchester united many investors hold the stock for sentimental rather than financial reasons. at present  mr glazer and his family hold a 28.1% stake  making them manchester united s second biggest shareholders. they own the successful tampa bay buccaneers american football team based in florida. if the family makes a formal offer  they will need the support of the club s biggest shareholders.  irish horse racing millionaires jp mcmanus and john magnier own 29% of united through their investment vehicle cubic expression  and have yet to express a view on the bid approach.  a group of five mps are calling on the department of trade and industry to block any takeover of the club by the us football magnate on public interest grounds. they have signed a house of commons motion  and tony lloyd  the manchester central mp  whose constituency includes the club s old trafford ground  has pledged to take the matter  to tony blair if necessary . the commons motion says  any takeover designed to transform the club into a private company would be against the interests of those supporters and football . however  the dti has dismissed the proposal. a spokesman said the department did not believe there was a case for changing the enterprise act so that takeovers of football clubs could be looked at on non-competition grounds. mr glazer s offer values the club at £800m ($1.5bn). pitched at 300p per share  it also relies less on debt to finance it than an earlier approach from the us tycoon  which was rejected out of hand. manchester united shares closed at 270.25p on friday  down 3.75p on the day.,man

567,1783,clarke plans migrant point scheme anyone planning to move to the uk will have to pass a test to prove they can contribute to the country  home secretary charles clarke has said.  he is proposing a points system similar to australia s but would avoid the quota system planned by the tories. mr clarke  who will unveil his plans on monday  said economic migration helped the uk but  needed proper policing . the lib dems say they will look at his plans  but tory liam fox said his party offered a  clear choice  on the issue. the conservative party co-chairman said the british electorate had a choice between a labour government that had  done nothing for eight years and will not set a limit  on immigration and a tory one that would impose quotas.  the home secretary said  by 2008  he wanted everyone given a visa and entering the uk to have their fingerprints taken  to  ensure we can know everybody who is in the country . speaking on bbc one s breakfast with frost  he said  economic migrants are of great value to this country   but stressed that proper policing was needed to ensure that they do not become a  burden on society . he said:  we will establish a system ... which looks at the skills  talents and abilities of people seeking to come and work in this country  and ensures that when they come here they have a job and can contribute to the economy of the country.   the home secretary  whose five-year blueprint for immigration and asylum is expected to be published on monday  also rejected claims that the immigration debate encouraged bigotry.  the issue of who does come into this country  and whether they are entitled to be in this country  who does settle here  how we have border controls  is a perfectly legitimate aspect of public debate   he said. liberal democrat home affairs spokesman mark oaten said:  whilst it is good that labour has rejected the tory idea of quotas on asylum  the jury is still out on the home office s ability to deliver a fair and efficient asylum system.   mr howard has said britain should take its fair share of the world s  genuine refugees . but he claims the current asylum system is being abused - and with it britain s generosity. trevor phillips  chairman of the commission for racial equality  called on mr clarke to denounce the suggestion britain s hospitality was being tested by immigration.  tell that to the 44 000 doctors in the nhs and the 70 000 nurses without whom we would really see what pressure on the health service means   he said.  ditto the teachers  from south africa  australia  jamaica  who are reducing the sizes of our classes and schools.  the refugee council said mr howard s proposals would mean there would be no safe haven in the uk.,clark plan migrant point scheme anyon plan move uk pas test prove contribut countri home secretari charl clark say propos point system similar australia would avoid quota system plan torus mr clark unveil plan monday say econom migrat help uk need proper polic lib dem say look plan torus liam fox say parti offer clear choic issu conserv parti cochairman say british elector choic labour govern do noth eight year set limit immigr torus one would impos quota home secretari say want everyon give visa enter uk fingerprint take ensur know everybodi countri speak bbc one breakfast frost say econom migrant great valu countri stress proper polic need ensur becom burden societi say establish system look skill talent abil peopl seek come work countri ensur come job contribut economi countri home secretari whose fiveyear blueprint immigr asylum expect publish monday also reject claim immigr debat encourag bigotri issu come countri whether entitl countri settl border control perfectli legitim aspect public debat say liber democrat home affair spokesman mark oaten say whilst good labour reject torus idea quota asylum juri still home offic abil deliv fair effici asylum system mr howard say britain take fair share world genuin refuge claim current asylum system abus britain generos trevor phillip chairman commiss racial equal call mr clark denounc suggest britain hospit test immigr tell doctor nh nurs without would realli see pressur health servic mean say ditto teacher south africa australia jamaica reduc size class school refuge council say mr howard propos would mean would safe uk

571,209,public show for reynolds portrait sir joshua reynolds  portrait of omai will get a public airing following fears it would stay hidden because of an export wrangle.  the tate gallery unsuccessfully tried to buy the picture from its anonymous owner after a ban was issued preventing the painting from leaving the uk. the 18th century painting has remained in storage but the owner has agreed to allow it to be part of an exhibition. the exhibition of reynolds  work will be shown at tate britain from may. joshua reynolds: the creation of celebrity will feature prints  caricatures  and sculpture by the 18th century artist  who painted some of the most famous personalities of his day. portrait of omai fetched the second highest amount for a british painting when it was sold at auction for £10.3m in 2001. it was bought by a london dealer who sold it on to a collector. the unnamed collector wanted to take it out of the country  but was barred from doing so by the government because of its historical significance.  in march 2004  the tate managed to raise £12.5m funding to buy the portrait but the owner refused to sell and it has been held in storage since. the portrait is of a young man who was dubbed  the noble savage  when he arrived in london from polynesia. he became a darling of london society and was invited to all the best parties by people who were fascinated by such an exotic character. sir joshua painted him after his arrival in 1774  and it became the artist s most famous work after it was first exhibited at the royal academy in 1776.,public show reynold portrait sir joshua reynold portrait omai get public air follow fear would stay hidden export wrangl tate galleri unsuccess tri buy pictur anonym owner ban issu prevent paint leav uk th centuri paint remain storag owner agre allow part exhibit exhibit reynold work show tate britain may joshua reynold creation celebr featur print caricatur sculptur th centuri artist paint famou person day portrait omai fetch second high amount british paint sell auction £m bought london dealer sell collector unnam collector want take countri bar govern histor signific march tate manag rais £m fund buy portrait owner refus sell held storag sinc portrait young man dub nobl savag arriv london polynesia becam darl london societi invit best parti peopl fascin exot charact sir joshua paint arriv becam artist famou work first exhibit royal academi
572,655,asylum children to face returns the uk government is planning to return asylum seeker children without parents to albania.  the trial scheme  which could start in weeks  may be extended to apply to children from other countries. children s charities have reacted with alarm  saying the policy amounts to forcible removal and may not guarantee the safety of those affected. but the home office says it may be in the children s best interests if it reunites them with their communities.  the pilot  included in the government s five-year immigration plan  aims to return unaccompanied asylum-seeking children from albania who have failed in their asylum claims.  since 2002  at least 9 000 under-18s have arrived in the uk to seek asylum without other family members. these children automatically become the responsibility of social services. up to now  ministers have held back from final removal orders against unaccompanied children until after they are legally adults at 18. at least a dozen albanian-born teenagers are thought to have been identified for return  according to sources  although there is no public confirmation of numbers. those selected could either be returned to their families  should they be traced  or placed in the care of other albanian authorities. separate negotiations to establish a family tracing and returns scheme are believed to be underway with another country.  under the 1989 children act  public bodies have a duty to act in the  best interest  of a child in their care. laura brownlees of save the children said there were grave concerns  not least because of the well-documented trafficking of children into crime and prostitution in albania.   if children are going to be returned then there should be proper assessments and decisions on a case by case basis   she said.  we do not think there are structures in place [to receive returning children in albania].  if these decisions are not in the best interests of the child  then that is a forced removal because the child will not have any choice in the final decision.  in its five-year immigration plan  announced on tuesday  the government said it was addressing  the difficult issue  of returning unaccompanied asylum seeking children. a spokesman for the home office said it was wholly wrong to suggest that the plan was to return children  and leave them to rot .  we are developing a returns programme for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children whose asylum and humanitarian protection claims have been refused   said the spokesman.  we have been exploring how we can establish reception and longer-term care arrangements in countries of origin and believe that it s possible to return children in a way that is in their best interests and is safe and sustainable.   we do not believe that it is right  or in keeping with children s legislation  that children who can return should remain in the uk indefinitely separated from their families and communities.  the spokesman stressed the uk would abide by its international human rights obligations. only those children who could be provided with a carefully planned reintegration package would be returned  he said. but andrew hogg  spokesman for the medical foundation for the care of victims of torture  said ministers had so far failed to reassure agencies.  from what is so far known  we strongly oppose the scheme because the welfare and best interests of the child will not properly be taken into account   said mr hogg.  in albania particularly there is no statutory child care or protection structure.  the medical foundation has many serious concerns  including the assessment process for suitability for return  the degrading of best interests of the child principles and of child welfare  and the lack of safeguards in the chosen countries.  a spokesman for the albanian embassy in london said it was the first it had heard of a scheme  but did not rule out that there had been an agreement between the two countries.,asylum child face return uk govern plan return asylum seeker child without parent albania trial scheme could start week may extend appli child countri child chariti react alarm say

573,2036,what now for kelly holmes  last april  kelly holmes spoke to the bbc sport website about her loneliness  her fight to stay fit and her decision not to contest both the 800m and 1500m at the olympics.  it just goes to show even the most meticulous and measured athletes cannot predict what fate has in store for them. four months later  holmes stormed to double olympic gold and has since been made a dame  won the bbc sport personality of the year and written a book whilst still finding time to coach aspiring athletes. with so much time spent in the spotlight  holmes has increasingly dropped hints that her ambition on the track has begun to wilt. and when asked about her plans for both the indoor and outdoor seasons ahead  the 34-year-old has repeatedly chosen to tick the  don t know  box. holmes has now pulled out of this weekend s european indoor championships  where she was selected for both the 800m and 1500m  because of a hamstring injury. but should we be surprised if the olympic champion over both those distances decides she just does not feel like racing anymore   well  it s a lot easier being the double olympic champion  being feted by everybody  than training to be at the top in middle distance running   points out former olympian and bbc pundit steve cram.  you have to have a real strong desire to carry on doing it even if you re very talented.   holmes  drive and determination have always been unquestionable - that is the reason she has battled back from a string of injuries that threatened to see her finish her career empty-handed. but alarm bells start ringing when the kent athlete begins questioning herself.  will i have as much commitment  desire and energy to go through a major championship   holmes asked in the new year.  that is what i don t know.  at 34  holmes will also be aware that time is running out. us 400m and 200m legend michael johnson  a five-time olympic gold medallist  retired shortly after his 34th birthday as did britain s double olympic champion decathlete daley thompson. the physical demands of the day-to-day grind will only get harder for holmes  who has already admitted she  doesn t like the training anymore.  whilst out on the circuit the allure of defeating a double olympic champion will spur her opponents on. holmes will not want to needlessly suffer the indignity of being beaten. unless she is certain she has a strong chance of winning any race  she will not step onto the track. but if the kent athlete finds the form that fuelled her ambitions last summer  there are more prizes up for grabs. the day after completing her double in athens  the 34-year-old revealed she would still like to win her first indoors title.  holmes  wish could easily be met in madrid before she goes on to prepare for the outdoor season where there are still scores to be settled  such as a first gold at the world championships in helsinki. there is just one small truth which could gnaw away at holmes  motivation - the realisation that no matter how hard she trains  nothing she wins now can surpass her achievements in athens. on the other hand  if those achievements cannot be matched shouldn t they be at least shared and celebrated   you don t get the chance very often in your career to step onto the track as the double olympic champion   agreed cram.  you want to be able to take your bow in front of the fans because it s a fantastic feeling.  i think deep down kelly wants to run. i think she will compete and run races on the circuits but whether or not she runs in the major championships is much less certain.   athletics fans had every reason to believe they would see the new-look kelly holmes tearing up the track again. after her olympic glory she emphatically denied she planned to retire. so  why is holmes dragging her heels about making a decision on where  when or whether to even bother competing again   that s just kelly   explains cram.  she s always been like that.  she enjoys people trying to guess what she is going to do next. she knows every time she makes a pronouncement now it s headline news.  kelly has to figure out for herself what it is she wants and that will be based on athletics decisions  whether she can be competitive  if she is fit enough to put her neck on the line.  and if she decides not to run again  no-one is going to turn round and say  you re making the wrong decision.,kelli holm last april kelli holm spoke bbc sport websit loneli fight stay fit decis contest m m olymp goe show even meticul measur athlet predict fate store four month later holm storm doubl olymp gold sinc make dame bbc sport person year write book whilst still find time coach aspir athlet much time spent spotlight holm increasingli drop hint ambit track begin wilt ask plan indoor outdoor season ahead yearold repeatedli chosen tick know box holm pull weekend european indoor championship select m m hamstr injuri surpris olymp champion distanc decid feel like race anymor well lot easy doubl olymp champion fete everybodi train top middl distanc run point former olympian bbc pundit steve cram real strong desir carri even talent holm drive determin alway unquestion reason battl back string injuri threaten see finish career emptyhand alarm bell start ring kent athlet begin question much commit desir energi go major championship holm ask new year know holm also awar time run u m m legend michael johnson fivetim olymp gold medallist retir shortli th birthday britain doubl olymp champion decathlet daley thompson physic demand daytoday grind get harder holm alreadi admit like train anymor whilst circuit allur defeat doubl olymp champion spur oppon holm want needlessli suffer indign beaten unless certain strong chanc win race step onto track kent athlet find form fuell ambit last summer prize grab day complet doubl athen yearold reveal would still like win first indoor titl holm wish could easili met madrid goe prepar outdoor season still score settl first gold world championship helsinki one small truth could gnaw away holm motiv realis matter hard train noth win surpass achiev athen hand achiev match least share celebr get chanc often career step onto track doubl olymp champion agre cram want abl take bow front fan fantast feel think deep kelli want run think compet run race circuit whether run major championship much less certain athlet fan everi reason believ would see newlook kelli holm tear track olymp glori emphat deni plan retir holm drag heel make decis whether even bother compet kelli explain cram alway like enjoy peopl tri guess go next know everi time make pronounc headlin news kelli figur want base athlet decis whether competit fit enough put neck line decid run noon go turn round say make wrong decis
574,1971,balco case trial date pushed back the trial date for the bay area laboratory cooperative (balco) steroid distribution case has been postponed.  us judge susan illston pushed back a preliminary evidentiary hearing - which was due to take place on wednesday - until 6 june. no official trial date has been set but it is expected to begin in september. balco founder victor conte along with james valente  coach remy korchemny and trainer greg anderson are charged with distributing steroids to athletes.  anderson s clients include barry bonds  and several other baseball stars have been asked to appear before a congressional inquiry into steroid use in the major leagues. the balco defence team have already lost their appeal to have the case dismissed at a pre-trial hearing in san francisco but will still argue the case should not go to trial. the hearing in june will focus on the admissibility of evidence gathered during police raids on balco s offices and anderson s home. conte and anderson were not arrested at that point but federal agents did obtain statements from them. the defence are expected to challenge the legality of those interviews and if ilston agrees she could could reject all the evidence from the raids. balco has been accused by the united states anti-doping agency (usada) of being the source of the banned steroid thg and modafinil.  former double world champion kelli white and olympic relay star alvin harrison have both been banned on the basis of materials discovered during the balco investigation. britain s former european 100m champion dwain chambers is currently serving a two-year ban after testing positive for thg in an out-of-competition test in 2003. and american sprinter marion jones has filed a lawsuit for defamation against conte following his allegations that he gave her performance-enhancing drugs.,balco case trial date push back trial date bay area laboratori cooper balco steroid distribut case postpon u judg susan illston push back preliminari evidentiari hear due take place wednesday june offici trial date set expect begin septemb balco founder victor cont along jame valent coach remi korchemni trainer greg anderson charg distribut steroid athlet anderson client includ barri bond sever basebal star ask appear congression inquiri steroid use major leagu balco defenc team alreadi lose appeal case dismiss pretrial hear san francisco still argu case go trial hear june focu admiss evid gather polic raid balco offic anderson home cont anderson arrest point feder agent obtain statement defenc expect challeng legal interview ilston agre could could reject evid raid balco accus unit state antidop agenc usada sourc ban steroid thg modafinil former doubl world champion kelli white olymp relay star alvin harrison ban basi materi discov balco investig britain former european m champion dwain chamber current serv twoyear ban test posit thg outofcompetit test american sprinter marion jone file lawsuit defam cont follow alleg give performanceenhanc drug
575,1760,jarvis sells tube stake to spain shares in engineering group jarvis have soared more than 16% on news that it is offloading its stake in london underground consortium tube lines.  the sale of the 33% stake to spain s ferrovial for £146m ($281m) is a lifeline to jarvis  which was weighed down by debts of more than £230m. the company recently warned it could go under if it did not secure a refinancing deal by mid-january 2005. but now its banks have agreed to extend its credit facilities until march 2006.  the company also said it had agreed terms over the completion of 14 of its biggest construction projects under the government s private finance initiative (pfi).  jarvis wants to scale back the division  which has proved too costly and has been blamed for many of its problems. instead  it plans to focus on uk rail renewal  roads and plant hire work. madrid-based ferrovial already holds a 33% stake in tube lines  which maintains the jubilee  northern and piccadilly lines. the spanish group has been keen to snap up more uk infrastructure assets  having bought amey in 2003. jarvis said the sale  which raked in more than the £100m analysts had expected  would  substantially  enhance its financial position.  i am now confident that we can now move forward in 2005 towards rebuilding jarvis and return it to growth as a profitable business   said chief executive alan lovell. shares in jarvis were up more than 16% to 18 pence by the close of trade on friday.,jarvi sell tube stake spain share engin group jarvi soar news offload stake london underground consortium tube line sale stake spain ferrovi £m m lifelin jarvi weigh debt £m compani recent warn could go secur refinanc deal midjanuari bank agre extend credit facil march compani also say agre term complet big construct project govern privat financ initi pfi jarvi want scale back divis prove costli blame mani problem instead plan focu uk rail renew road plant hire work madridbas ferrovi alreadi hold stake tube line maintain jubile northern piccadilli line spanish group keen snap uk infrastructur asset bought amey jarvi say sale rake £m analyst expect would substanti enhanc financi posit confid move forward toward rebuild jarvi return growth profit busi say chief execut alan lovel share jarvi penc close trade friday
576,1641,blog  picked as word of the year the term  blog  has been chosen as the top word of 2004 by a us dictionary publisher.  merriam-webster said  blog  headed the list of most looked-up terms on its site during the last twelve months. during 2004 blogs  or web logs  have become hugely popular and some have started to influence mainstream media. other words on the merriam-webster list were associated with major news events such as the us presidential election or natural disasters that hit the us.  merriam-webster defines a blog as:  a web site that contains an online personal journal with reflections  comments and often hyperlinks . its list of most looked-up words is drawn up every year and it discounts terms such as swear words  that everyone likes to look up  or those that always cause problems  such as  affect  and  effect .  merriam-webster said  blog  was the word that people have asked to be defined or explained most often over the last 12 months. the word will now appear in the 2005 version of merriam-webster s printed dictionary. however  the word is already included in some printed versions of the oxford english dictionary. a spokesman for the oxford university press said that the word was now being put into other dictionaries for children and learners  reflecting its mainstream use.  i think it was the word of last year rather than this year   he said.  now we re getting words that derive from it such as  blogosphere  and so on   he said.  but   he added   it s a pretty recent thing and in the way that this happens these days it s got established very quickly.   blogs come in many different forms. many act as news sites for particular groups or subjects  some are written from a particular political slant and others are simply lists of interesting sites. other terms in the top 10 were related to natural disasters that have struck the us  such as  hurricane  or were to do with the us election. words such as  incumbent    electoral  and  partisan  reflected the scale of interest in the vote. blogs also proved very useful to both sides in the us election battle because many pundits who maintain their own journals were able to air opinions that would never appear in more mainstream media. speculation that president bush was getting help during debates via a listening device was first aired on web logs. online journals also raised doubts about documents used by us television news organisation cbs in a story about president bush s war record. the immediacy of many blogs also helped some wield influence over topics that made it in to national press.  this is despite the fact that the number of people reading even the most influential blogs is tiny. statistics by web influence ranking firm hitwise reveal that the most popular political blog racks up only 0.0051% of all net visits per day. one of the reasons that blogs and regularly updated online journals have become popular is because the software used to put them together make it very easy for people to air their views online. according to blog analysis firm technorati the number of blogs in existence  the blogosphere  has doubled every five and a half months for the last 18 months. technorati now estimates that the number of blogs in existence has exceeded 4.8 million. some speculate that less than a quarter of this number are regularly maintained. according to us research firm pew internet & american life a blog is created every 5.8 seconds. another trend this year has been the increasing numbers of weblogs that detail the daily lives of many ordinary workers in jobs that few people know much about. in many repressive regimes and developing nations  blogs have been embraced by millions of people keen to give their plight a voice.,blog pick

577,1624,global blogger action day called the global web blog community is being called into action to lend support to two imprisoned iranian bloggers.  the month-old committee to protect bloggers  is asking those with blogs to dedicate their sites on 22 february to the  free mojtaba and arash day . arash sigarchi and mojtaba saminejad are both in prison in iran. blogs are free sites through which people publish thoughts and opinions. iranian authorities have been clamping down on prominent sites for some time.  i hope this day will focus people   curt hopkins  director of the committee  told the bbc news website.  the group has a list of actions which it says bloggers can take  including writing to local iranian embassies. the committee has deemed tuesday  free mojtaba and arash day  as part of its first campaign. it is calling on the blogsphere - the name for the worldwide community of bloggers - to do what it can to help raise awareness of the plight of mojtaba and arash as well as other  cyber-dissidents .  if you have a blog  the least you could do is put nothing on that blog except  free mojtaba and arash day    said mr hopkins.  that would mean you could see that phrase 7.1 million times. that alone will shine some light on the situation.  if you don t have one  find one dedicated to that - it takes about 30 seconds.  technorati  a blog search engine  tracks about six million blogs and says that more than 12 000 are added daily. a blog is created every 5.8 seconds  according to a us research think-tank.  the committee to protect bloggers was started by us blogger curt hopkins and counts fired flight attendant blogger ellen simonetti as a deputy director. she has since started the international bloggers  bill of rights  a global petition to protect bloggers at work. although not the only website committed to human rights issues by any means  it aims to be the hub or organisation  information and support for bloggers in particular and their rights to freedom of speech.  the committee  although only a month old  aims to be the focal point for blogger action on similar issues in the future  and will operate as a non-for-profit organisation.  blogging is in this weird no man s land. people think of it as being one thing or another depending on their point of view   said mr hopkins.  some think of themselves as pundits  kind of like journalists  and some like me have a private blog which is just a publishing platform.  but they do not have a constituency and are out there in the cold.   it is not just human rights issues in countries which have a track record of restricting what is published in the media that is of concern to bloggers. the question of bloggers and what rights they have to say what they want on their sites is a thorny one and has received much press attention recently. high profile cases in which employees have been sacked for what they have said on their personal  and often anonymous blogs  have highlighted the muddy situation that the blogsphere is currently in.   this is a big messy argument   explained mr hopkins. he added:  it is just such a new way of doing business  there will be clamp downs.  but the way these issues get tested is through the courts which  said mr hopkins   is part of the whole messy conversation.   if you haven t already got bloggers in your company  you will have them tomorrow - and if you don t have a blogger policy now you had better start looking at having one. mr hopkins said that the blogsphere - which is doubling every five months - was powerful because it takes so little time and expertise to create a blog.  everyone does this - mums  radicals  conservatives   he said. many companies offer easy-to-use services to create a blog and publish it in minutes to a global community.  that is the essential difference. what i call  templating software  gives every single person on earth the chance to have one.  you don t even have to have your own computer.,global blogger action day call global web blog commun call action lend support two imprison iranian blogger monthold committe protect blogger ask blog dedic site februari free mojtaba arash day arash sigarchi mojtaba saminejad prison iran blog free site peopl publish thought opinion iranian author clamp promin site time hope day focu peopl curt hopkin director committe told bbc news websit group list action say blogger take includ write local iranian embassi committe deem tuesday free mojtaba arash day part first campaign call blogspher name worldwid commun blogger help rais awar plight mojtaba arash well cyberdissid blog least could put noth blog except free mojtaba arash day say mr hopkin would mean could see phrase million time alon shine light situat one find one dedic take second technorati blog search engin track six million blog say ad daili blog creat everi second accord u research thinktank committe protect blogger start u blogger curt hopkin count fire flight attend blogger ellen simonetti deputi director sinc start intern blogger bill right global petit protect blogger work although websit commit human right issu mean aim hub organis inform support blogger particular right freedom speech committe although month old aim focal point blogger action similar issu futur oper nonforprofit organis blog weird man land peopl think one thing anoth depend point view say mr hopkin think pundit kind like journalist like privat blog publish platform constitu cold human right issu countri track record restrict publish medium concern blogger question blogger right say want site thorni one receiv much press attent recent high profil case employe sack say person often anonym blog highlight muddi situat blogspher current big messi argument explain mr hopkin ad new way busi clamp down way issu get test court say mr hopkin part whole messi convers alreadi get blogger compani tomorrow blogger polici well start look one mr hopkin say blogspher doubl everi five month power take littl time expertis creat blog everyon mum radic conserv say mani compani offer easytous servic creat blog publish minut global commun essenti differ call templat softwar give everi singl person earth chanc one even comput

581,443,scotland 18-10 italy six chris paterson penalties gave scotland victory in a dour but clinical encounter against italy at murrayfield.  coach matt williams  side were outmuscled and outplayed in a tense first half but led 6-3 at the break. paterson slotted four more second-half penalties and scotland were denied a try when wing sean lamont s touchdown was ruled out for a forward pass. a late andrea masi try was small consolation for italy  chasing their first away win in the six nations. scotland came out on top of the early exchanges and took a quick 3-0 lead through the boot of full-back paterson. but the more powerful azzurri pack eventually rumbled into life.  a series of drives into scottish territory set up a penalty attempt  missed by full-back roland de marigny  and a wayward drop-goal effort from luciano orquera. scotland defended the initial thrusts but on 20 minutes italy  after coming up yards short of the line  equalised through a de marigny penalty. italy were offered another penalty when scottish flanker simon taylor was offside but the left-footed de marigny pushed his kick wide. scotland finally made the most of a rare foray into the italian half and snatched three points from paterson when an italian forward handled the ball in a ruck.  as the half wore on  both sides squandered promising spells of momentum with sloppy penalties  and the period fizzled out with scotland numerically  if not psychologically  on top. italy s de marigny narrowly missed a chance to level the scores again shortly after the break but his long-range kick shaved the right upright. and scotland capitalised with a third paterson penalty on 50 minutes. williams  side seemed to have found a spark from somewhere and  after a couple of probing attacks  paterson was able to slot another three points to widen the gap.  with the pendulum of possession swinging towards scotland  lamont thought he had wriggled over in the left corner after 65 minutes but play was recalled for a marginal forward pass from paterson. another paterson penalty on 70 minutes kept the pressure on the wilting visitors. but john kirwan s men had the last laugh when gordon ross  attempted clearance was charged down and masi pounced for the try  converted by de marigny.  : c paterson; s webster  a craig  h southwell  s lamont; d parks  c cusiter; t smith  g bulloch (capt)  g kerr; s grimes  s murray; s taylor  j petrie  a hogg.  r russell  b douglas  n hines  j dunbar  m blair  g ross  b hinshelwood.  r de marigny; mirco bergamasco  c stoica  a masi  l nitoglia; l orquera  a troncon; a lo cicero  f ongaro  m castrogiovanni; s dellape  m bortolami (capt); a persico  d dal maso  s parisse.  g intoppa  s perugini  ca del fava  s orlando  p griffen  r pedrazzi  kp robertson.,scotland itali six chri paterson penalti give scotland victori dour clinic encount itali murrayfield coach matt william side outmuscl outplay ten first half lead break paterson slot four secondhalf penalti scotland deni tri wing sean lamont touchdown rule forward pas late andrea masi tri small consol itali chase first away win six nation scotland come top earli exchang take quick lead boot fullback paterson power azzurri pack eventu rumbl life seri drive scottish territori set penalti attempt miss fullback roland de marigni wayward dropgoal effort luciano orquera scotland defend initi thrust minut itali come yard short line equalis de marigni penalti itali offer anoth penalti scottish flanker simon taylor offsid leftfoot de marigni push kick wide scotland final make rare foray italian half snatch three point paterson italian forward handl ball ruck half wore side squander promis spell momentum sloppi penalti period fizzl scotland numer psycholog top itali de marigni narrowli miss chanc level score shortli break longrang kick shave right upright scotland capitalis third paterson penalti minut william side seem found spark somewher coupl probe attack paterson abl slot anoth three point widen gap pendulum posse swing toward scotland lamont thought wriggl left corner minut play recal margin forward pas paterson anoth paterson penalti minut kept pressur wilt visitor john kirwan men last laugh gordon ross attempt clearanc charg masi pounc tri convert de marigni c paterson webster craig h southwel lamont park c cusit smith g bulloch capt g kerr grime murray taylor j petri hogg r russel b dougla n hine j dunbar blair g ross b hinshelwood r de marigni mirco bergamasco c stoica masi l nitoglia l orquera troncon lo cicero f ongaro castrogiovanni dellap bortolami capt persico dal maso paris g intoppa perugini ca del fava orlando p griffen r pedrazzi kp robertson

588,1751,connors  rallying cry for british tennis  do you have it in your heart  how much guts do you have  how much do you hate to lose    these are the questions jimmy connors will be asking of britain s brightest tennis hopes in the months  and possibly years  to come. the american legend swept into london on thursday to announce a  long-term  relationship with the lawn tennis association after spending three days at the elite performance winter camp in la manga. and the man who epitomised the phrase  will to win  before lleyton hewitt was even born is clear about the qualities he hopes to convey.  you know  everybody hits the ball well and there s a very fine line between number one and number 100   said connors.  i was that fine line for a long time. but if i can help  i want to be part of teaching kids how to win.   connors is not the first great name to offer his services to the lta - his long-time rival john mcenroe has repeatedly done the same. but connors is at pains to point out that his interest goes well beyond any publicity stunt  and he gave a glowing recommendation to the work of lta performance director david felgate and his team.  britain has a different attitude  the right attitude  in taking the game forward and finding the next wimbledon champion   said connors.  that s something you don t find every day. everybody talks a good game but not everybody puts that into effect.  the impression i came away with after just seeing david and the other coaches for three days was one like i ve never seen before  especially over here.  this is not going to happen overnight  there are no miracle workers  but you re going in the right direction.  the 52-year-old s enthusiasm for the work going on in this country is in marked contrast to his relationship with tennis officials back in america.  i ve had discussions with the usta (united states tennis association) over a number of years   he said.  that s where it (my input) ended.  connors is a straight-talker and will be equally blunt and honest in his dealings with the lta and the cream of britain s young players.  if they re chosen  they ve got to produce   he said.   if not  someone will come and take their place. there s only one number one spot and it s lonely up there  but it s got the best view.  in the year that has seen andrew murray emerge as britain s great new hope  connors rejected suggestions that the scot might be put under too much pressure too soon.  tim henman has a whole country on his shoulder   said connors.  i don t know that pressure  but if you like that it can be a certain push to get on to the next level.  someone s going to have to come and take over from him (henman). if i was andrew murray  i d embrace that. that s what we play for.  despite the emphasis on hard work  training and preparation  connors does admit that the desire required of a champion has to come from within.  the passion i had  i don t know if you can find that   he admitted.  i was also nuts. i say that because there was nothing better for me than to compete on the tennis court.  it was the most important thing in the world for me  and to do that something s got to be not right with you. there was nothing better for me ever than to play tennis in front of 25 000 people.  what i had when i played tennis is what i am. you have to have that  you can t be moulded.,connor ralli cri british tenni heart much gut much hate lose question jimmi connor ask britain brightest tenni hope month possibl year come american legend swept london thursday announc longterm relationship lawn tenni associ spend three day elit perform winter camp la manga man epitomis phrase win lleyton hewitt even born clear qualiti hope convey know everybodi hit ball well fine line number one number say connor fine line long time help want part teach kid win connor first great name offer servic lta longtim rival john mcenro repeatedli do connor pain point interest goe well beyond public stunt give glow recommend work lta perform director david felgat team britain differ attitud right attitud take game forward find next wimbledon champion say connor someth find everi day everybodi talk good game everybodi put effect impress come away see david coach three day one like never see especi go happen overnight miracl worker go right direct yearold enthusiasm work go countri mark contrast relationship tenni offici back america discus usta unit state tenni associ number year say input end connor straighttalk equal blunt honest deal lta cream britain young player chosen get produc say someon come take place one number one spot lone get best view year see andrew murray emerg britain great new hope connor reject suggest scot might put much pressur soon tim henman whole countri shoulder say connor know pressur like certain push get next level someon go come take henman andrew murray embrac play despit emphasi hard work train prepar connor admit desir requir champion come within passion know find admit also nut say noth well compet tenni court import thing world someth get right noth well ever play tenni front peopl play tenni mould
589,1400,european medal chances improve what have the european indoor trials told us  well  i think we could be heading to the european championships with half a dozen medal prospects.  it was good to see athletes beginning to make steps forward  to see a few new faces and there were lots of personal bests kicking around.  the best performance on the track for me was sarah claxton s win in the 60m hurdles. running sub-eight seconds twice in a week puts her right up there and if she repeats that in madrid she will be close to picking up a medal. but what was great about sunday s performance was that she was under pressure to produce the goods when it counted. diane allahgreen has been our best hurdler for some time now and i think she was surprised to be beaten by sarah. and knowing that she got the better of diane in a head-to-head race will give sarah confidence. in the men s race on saturday  allan scott was right in there and there is definitely more to come from him. in fact  the men s 60m hurdles is so strong  i think the selectors will pick three hurdlers to go to madrid.  phillips idowu lit up the field events  not only with his hair  but also with his leap of 17.30m  which puts him at the top of the world rankings. i had a chat with him before the competition and he was really looking forward to getting out there. he feels he is in great shape and has some big jumps inside him - but then phillips always has. a lot of the athletes said the runway was not very helpful  so for phillips to jump like that is a good performance. he is such a huge talent but just needs some consistency - and if he does that then the big jumps will get even further. across the board i thought kelly sotherton had a great weekend and continued to show she is developing. she picked up three personal bests in the long jump  high jump and 60m hurdles and you can t ask for more than that. kelly will be up against carolina kluft in the pentathlon at the european championships but she has every chance of a medal on the basis of what we ve seen so far.  she has a complicated training regime where different people help her with different disciplines but it seems to be working really well. it wasn t all good news in sheffield. i thought both the 60m races were disappointing in different ways. jason gardener may have won but he wasn t at his best. i chatted to him afterwards and he knows it was an off-day for him. he s there to be shot at and the other lads nearly got a big scalp out there. in the women s race  jeanette kwayke was hoping to run against defending champion joice maduaka. the pair are enjoying a bit of rivalry but joice had to pull out with a chest infection. if she had made the final i think jeanette would have gone a bit quicker.  janine whitlock competed well in the pole vault on her return following a two-year drugs ban. but the most disappointing thing in the wider view is that she is our best pole vaulter by a long way and that shouldn t be the case. the event has moved on immensely since janine has been away and if there was more domestic competition i think that would help her. a couple of other interesting topics to look out for are the citizenship issues surrounding mark findlay and rabah yusuf. findlay is a londoner who has chosen to represent trinidad and tobago but has never run for them so he could still compete for great britain. yusuf  who came third in the 400m  is from the sudan but is trying to gain british citizenship. he came to britain as a high jumper but damaged his toe  started doing more running and found his talent. so we shall have to see what happens to both of them.,european medal chanc improv european indoor trial told u well think could head european championship half dozen medal prospect good see athlet begin make step forward see new face lot person best kick around best perform track sarah claxton win m hurdl run subeight second twice week put right repeat madrid close pick medal great sunday perform pressur produc good count dian allahgreen best hurdler time think surpris beaten sarah know get well dian headtohead race give sarah confid men race saturday allan scott right definit come fact men m hurdl strong think selector pick three hurdler go madrid phillip idowu lit field event hair also leap m put top world rank chat competit realli look forward get feel great shape big jump insid phillip alway lot athlet say runway help phillip jump like good perform huge talent need consist big jump get even across board thought kelli sotherton great weekend continu show develop pick three person best long jump high jump m hurdl ask kelli carolina kluft pentathlon european championship everi chanc medal basi see far complic train regim differ peopl help differ disciplin seem work realli well good news sheffield thought m race disappoint differ way jason garden may best chat afterward know offday shot lad nearli get big scalp woman race jeanett kwayk hope run defend champion joic maduaka pair enjoy bit rivalri joic pull chest infect make final think jeanett would go bit quicker janin whitlock compet well pole vault return follow twoyear drug ban disappoint thing wider view best pole vaulter long way case event move immens sinc janin away domest competit think would help coupl interest topic look citizenship issu surround mark findlay rabah yusuf findlay london chosen repres trinidad tobago never run could still compet great britain yusuf come third m sudan tri gain british citizenship come britain high jumper damag toe start run found talent shall see happen

591,16,s korean credit card firm rescued south korea s largest credit card firm has averted liquidation following a one trillion won ($960m; £499m) bail-out.  lg card had been threatened with collapse because of its huge debts but the firm s creditors and its former parent have stepped in to rescue it. a consortium of creditors and lg group  a family owned conglomerate  have each put up $480m to stabilise the firm. lg card has seven million customers and its collapse would have sent shockwaves through the country s economy.  the firm s creditors - which own 99% of lg card - have been trying to agree a deal to secure its future for several weeks. they took control of the company in january when it avoided bankruptcy only through a $4.5bn bail-out.  they had threatened to delist the company  a move which would have triggered massive debt redemptions and forced the company into bankruptcy  unless agreement was reached on its future funding.  lg card will not need any more financial aid after this   laah chong-gyu  executive director of korea development bank - one of the firm s creditors - said.  the agreement will see some 12 trillion won of debt converted into equity.  the purpose of the capital injection is to avoid delisting and the goal will be met   david kim  an analyst at sejong securities  told reuters. south korea s consumer credit market has been slowly recovering from a crisis in 2002 when a credit bubble burst and millions of consumers fell behind on their debt repayments. lg card returned to profit in september but needed further capital to avoid being thrown off the market. south korea s stock exchange can delist any firm if its debt exceeds its assets two years running.,korean credit card firm rescu south korea large credit card firm avert liquid follow one trillion m £m bailout lg card threaten collaps huge debt firm creditor former parent step rescu consortium creditor lg group famili own conglomer put m stabilis firm lg card seven million custom collaps would sent shockwav countri economi firm creditor lg card tri agre deal secur futur sever week take control compani januari avoid bankruptci bn bailout threaten delist compani move would trigger massiv debt redempt forc compani bankruptci unless agreement reach futur fund lg card need financi aid laah chonggyu execut director korea develop bank one firm creditor say agreement see trillion debt convert equiti purpos capit inject avoid delist goal met david kim analyst sejong secur told reuter south korea consum credit market slowli recov crisi credit bubbl burst million consum fell behind debt repay lg card return profit septemb need capit avoid thrown market south korea stock exchang delist firm debt exce asset two year run
592,2048,bombardier chief to leave company shares in train and plane-making giant bombardier have fallen to a 10-year low following the departure of its chief executive and two members of the board.  paul tellier  who was also bombardier s president  left the company amid an ongoing restructuring. laurent beaudoin  part of the family that controls the montreal-based firm  will take on the role of ceo under a newly created management structure. analysts said the resignations seem to have stemmed from a boardroom dispute. under mr tellier s tenure at the company  which began in january 2003  plans to cut the worldwide workforce of 75 000 by almost a third by 2006 were announced. the firm s snowmobile division and defence services unit were also sold and bombardier started the development of a new aircraft seating 110 to 135 passengers.  mr tellier had indicated he wanted to stay at the world s top train maker and third largest manufacturer of civil aircraft until the restructuring was complete. but bombardier has been faced with a declining share price and profits. earlier this month the firm said it earned $10m (£19.2m) in the third quarter  down from a profit of $133m a year ago.  i understand the board s concern that i would not be there for the long-term and the need to develop and execute strategies  and the need to reshape the management structure at this time   mr tellier said in a statement on monday. bombardier said restructuring plans drawn up by mr tellier s would continue to be implemented. shares in bombardier lost 65 canadian cents or 25% on the news to 1.90 canadian dollars before rallying to 2.20 canadian dollars.,bombardi chief leav compani share train planemak giant bombardi fall year low follow departur chief execut two member board paul tellier also bombardi presid left compani amid ongo restructur laurent beaudoin part famili control montrealbas firm take role ceo newli creat manag structur analyst say resign seem stem boardroom disput mr tellier tenur compani begin januari plan cut worldwid workforc almost third announc firm snowmobil divis defenc servic unit also sell bombardi start develop new aircraft seat passeng mr tellier indic want stay world top train maker third large manufactur civil aircraft restructur complet bombardi face declin share price profit earlier month firm say earn m £m third quarter profit m year ago understand board concern would longterm need develop execut strategi need reshap manag structur time mr tellier say statement monday bombardi say restructur plan drawn mr tellier would continu implement share bombardi lose canadian cent news canadian dollar ralli canadian dollar

594,1765,nintendo ds aims to touch gamers the mobile gaming industry is set to explode in 2005 with a number of high-profile devices offering a range of gaming and other features such as movie and music playback. market leader nintendo  however  is releasing a handheld console that it says will revolutionise the way games are played.  the first striking thing about the ds is how retro it looks. far from looking like a mould-breaking handheld  it looks more like nintendo dug out a mould from a 1980s handheld prototype. the lightweight clam shell device opens up to reveal two screens  and when switched on it instantly reveals its pedigree. both screens are crisp and clear while the bottom of the two is touch sensitive. nintendo has given developers free rein to utilise the dual screens and ability to control the action by simply touching the screen.  the japanese gaming giant hopes the ds will maintain the firm s pre-eminence in an increasingly-competitive mobile gaming market.  nintendo first launched its gameboy console in 1989 and has dominated the market ever since. but its lead can no longer be taken for granted. sony will enter the market later this year with its playstation portable  while start-up companies gizmondo and tapwave zodiac are also offering hybrid devices.  we believe the ds will appeal to all ages  both genders and gamers of any skill   said david yarnton  nintendo europe s general manager said at the recent press launch for the handheld. with its two screens  wireless connectivity and backwards compatibility with the gameboy advance  the ds certainly has a number of unique selling points. it went on sale in the us in mid-november priced $150 and nintendo says sales have exceeded expectations  without giving detailed figures. japan and europe will have to wait until the first quarter of 2005 to get the device. with more than two million pre-orders for the device in japan  nintendo is confident it will keep its number one spot. but will the device prove to be as revolutionary as claimed  the game ships with a demo of metroid hunters - a 3d action title which can be played alone or with a group of friends using the machine s wireless capabilities. it certainly looks impressive on the small machine and plays smoothly even with a group of people.  the game can be controlled by using the supplied stylus to aim. the top screen is used to navigate the action while the bottom screen offers a top-down map and the ability to switch weapons. it is certainly a unique control method and while it makes aiming more controlled it can be a little disorientating. super mario 64 ds is a faithful re-creation of the nintendo 64 classic with a host of new mini-games and new levels. the game looks stunning on the portable machine and the sound too is impressive for such a small machine. one thing is for certain. hardened gamers will have to learn to adapt to a new way of playing while it could prove to be an accessible way in to gaming for novices  ultimately the success or failure of the device lies in the hands of developers. if they manage to create titles which use the nintendo ds s key features then a whole new market of gamers could open up. the fear is that the touch screen and voice recognition are treated as little more than gimmicks.,nintendo d aim touch gamer mobil game industri set explod number highprofil devic offer rang game featur movi music playback market leader nintendo howev releas handheld consol say revolutionis way game play first strike thing d retro look far look like mouldbreak handheld look like nintendo dug mould s handheld prototyp lightweight clam shell devic open reveal two screen switch instantli reveal pedigre screen crisp clear bottom two touch sensit nintendo give develop free rein utilis dual screen abil control action simpli touch screen japanes game giant hope d maintain firm preemin increasinglycompetit mobil game market nintendo first launch gameboy consol domin market ever sinc lead longer take grant soni enter market later year playstat portabl startup compani gizmondo tapwav zodiac also offer hybrid devic believ d appeal age gender gamer skill say david yarnton nintendo europ gener manag say recent press launch handheld two screen wireless connect backward compat gameboy advanc d certainli number uniqu sell point go sale u midnovemb price nintendo say sale exceed expect without give detail figur japan europ wait first quarter get devic two million preorder devic japan nintendo confid keep number one spot devic prove revolutionari claim game ship demo metroid hunter d action titl play alon group friend use machin wireless capabl certainli look impress small machin play smoothli even group peopl game control use suppli stylu aim top screen use navig action bottom screen offer topdown map abil switch weapon certainli uniqu control method make aim control littl disorient super mario d faith recreat nintendo classic host new minigam new level game look stun portabl machin sound impress small machin one thing certain harden gamer learn adapt new way play could prove access way game novic ultim success failur devic lie hand develop manag creat titl use nintendo d key featur whole new market gamer could open fear touch screen voic recognit treat littl gimmick
595,230,france v wales (sat) stade de france  paris  saturday  26 february  1600 gmt  bbc1  radio 4 lw and this website  france may have beaten scotland and england but they were tedious and uninspired throughout both matches. wales  on the other hand  have played some fine rugby and have made their best start since they last won the title in 1994. they also have a good record at the stade de france  having won their first two games there  in 1999 and 2001. wales have made two changes from the team that thrashed italy 38-8 in rome.  kevin morgan takes over from his injured newport-gwent dragons colleague hal luscombe on the right wing. in the pack neath-swansea ospreys forward ryan jones bas been brought on the blind-side flank to beef up the wales back row in place of jonathan thomas. wales coach mike ruddock is determined that his team will not go into their shells after their promising start to the championship.  graham henry (former wales coach) said a couple of years ago that we should  be bold  when going to france  and he was proved right   said ruddock.  that is a great way to approach the game  and something we will further endorse with the players this week.   despite their stuttering displays in their first two games defending champions france are also unbeaten. under-pressure coach bernard laporte has made four changes  with yannick nyanga  the debutant julien laharrague  aurelien rougerie and yannick jauzion coming into the side. france have been criticised for the absence of traditional  french flair  as they have ground their way to victory so far this year but captain fabien pelous sees hope on the horizon.  i get the impression we are getting better   he said.  against wales  which is different from the teams we have beaten  i hope we can show our proper game.   j laharrague; a rougerie  y jauzion  d traille  c dominici; y delaigue  d yachvili; s marconnet  s bruno  n mas; f pelous (capt)  j thion; s betsen  y nyanga  j bonnaire (bourgoin).  w servat  o milloud  g lamboley  i harinordoquy  p mignoni  f michalak  j-p grandclaude.  g thomas (capt); k morgan  t shanklin  g henson  s williams; s jones  d peel; g jenkins  m davies  a jones; b cockbain  r sidoli; r jones  m williams  m owen.  r mcbryde  j yapp  j thomas  r sowden-taylor  g cooper  c sweeney  r williams.,franc v wale sat stade de franc pari saturday februari gmt bbc radio lw websit franc may beaten scotland england tediou uninspir throughout match wale hand play fine rugbi make best start sinc last titl also good record stade de franc first two game wale make two chang team thrash itali rome kevin morgan take injur newportgw dragon colleagu hal luscomb right wing pack neathswansea osprey forward ryan jone ba brought blindsid flank beef wale back row place jonathan thoma wale coach mike ruddock determin team go shell promis start championship graham henri former wale coach say coupl year ago bold go franc prove right say ruddock great way approach game someth endors player week despit stutter display first two game defend champion franc also unbeaten underpressur coach bernard laport make four chang yannick nyanga debut julien laharragu aurelien rougeri yannick jauzion come side franc criticis absenc tradit french flair ground way victori far year captain fabien pelou see hope horizon get impress get well say wale differ team beaten hope show proper game j laharragu rougeri jauzion traill c dominici delaigu yachvili marconnet bruno n ma f pelou capt j thion betsen nyanga j bonnair bourgoin w servat milloud g lamboley harinordoquy p mignoni f michalak jp grandclaud g thoma capt k morgan shanklin g henson william jone peel g jenkin davi jone b cockbain r sidoli r jone william owen r mcbryde j yapp j thoma r sowdentaylor g cooper c sweeney r william
596,1231,asia quake increases poverty risk nearly two million people across asia could be thrown into poverty because of the indian ocean tsunami  the asian development bank (adb) has said.  in its first overview of the disaster  the adb said the impact on economic growth would be slight because major cities and factories escaped damage. but the blow to many low-income people could be  enormous . the paris club of rich creditor nations on wednesday offered to freeze debts owed by tsunami-hit countries.  the move was aimed at helping south asian governments find budgets to rebuild devastated coastal areas  though so far only sri lanka  indonesia and the seychelles have indicated that they will take it up.  other countries believe their economies are strong enough to cope or wish to avoid being viewed as credit risks.  poverty is potentially the most important impact of this natural disaster   said adb chief economist ifzal ali. donor nations have promised to give $717m (£379m) in disaster relief over the next six months  according to the united nations.  mr ali added his voice to those warning that aid pledges must be promptly delivered  saying the number of people at risk of poverty hinged on  concerns over sanitation and health conditions  and other basic needs  being  properly and quickly addressed .  there are 1.9 billion people in asia living on less than $2 a day. the adb fears that 1 million indonesians could join them  while in india just over half a million people - 645 000 - are at risk of falling into poverty. a quarter of a million sri lankans and 23 500 people in the maldives are also facing poverty. in the maldives  where 43% of the population already lives on less than $2 a day  this could rise to half. sri lanka and the maldives are the two countries the adb fears are most at risk of suffering lasting economic damage from the tsunami. sri lanka s government has estimated reconstruction costs at nearly $3bn. a government task force held meetings to discuss an emergency rebuilding plan with the adb  world bank and japanese aid agencies on wednesday  and promised to publish the plan within 10 days.  indonesia  malaysia  thailand and india have enjoyed strong economic growth in recent years  which should cushion them against reconstruction costs. although indonesia s northern province of aceh suffered the worst death toll  the region s oil and natural gas production facilities  have survived intact   the report said. however  it remains too soon to asses the damage to poor people s livelihoods in aceh because it would depend on how much farm land had been flooded by seawater.  this is a profoundly tragic event for the region and for the millions who are suffering. but the economies of the affected countries except sri lanka and the maldives should emerge with minimal damage   the adb report said. some businesses may even gain from the reconstruction efforts  thereby creating jobs. at a meeting in thailand  abd president thadao chino said he was confident of the country s  own capabilities to restore normalcy to the affected areas and meet the rehabilitation requirements . thailand has said it does not wish to opt for a debt repayment freeze  while india has also rejected international aid  saying it can cope on its own resources. debt repayment holidays carry the risk of credit ratings downgrades  making it more expensive to borrow money in future. indonesia  however  is pressing for greater help with its debts than the current freeze would bring. it is one of the world s most indebted countries.,asia quak increas poverti risk nearli two million peopl across asia could thrown poverti indian ocean tsunami asian develop bank adb say first overview disast adb say impact econom growth would slight major citi factori escap damag blow mani lowincom peopl could enorm pari club rich creditor nation wednesday offer freez debt owe tsunamihit countri move aim help south asian govern find budget rebuild devast coastal area though far sri lanka indonesia seychel indic take countri believ economi strong enough cope wish avoid view credit risk poverti potenti import impact natur disast say adb chief economist ifzal ali donor nation promis give m £m disast relief next six month accord unit nation mr ali ad voic warn aid pledg must promptli deliv say number peopl risk poverti hing concern sanit health condit basic need properli quickli address billion peopl asia live less day adb fear million indonesian could join india half million peopl risk fall poverti quarter million sri lankan peopl maldiv also face poverti maldiv popul alreadi live less day could rise half sri lanka maldiv two countri adb fear risk suffer last econom damag tsunami sri lanka govern estim reconstruct cost nearli bn govern task forc held meet discus emerg rebuild plan adb world bank japanes aid agenc wednesday promis publish plan within day indonesia malaysia thailand india enjoy strong econom growth recent year cushion reconstruct cost although indonesia northern provinc aceh suffer bad death toll region oil natur ga product facil surviv intact report say howev remain soon as damag poor peopl livelihood aceh would depend much farm land flood seawat profoundli tragic event region million suffer economi affect countri except sri lanka maldiv emerg minim damag adb report say busi may even gain reconstruct effort therebi creat job meet thailand abd presid thadao chino say confid countri capabl restor normalci affect area meet rehabilit requir thailand say wish opt debt repay freez india also reject intern aid say cope resourc debt repay holiday carri risk credit rate downgrad make expens borrow money futur indonesia howev press great help debt current freez would bring one world indebt countri
597,1178,labour mps  fears over squabbling if there is one thing certain to stiffen the spines of labour mps it is the prospect of losing their seats at a general election.  and it was largely that fear that led to tony blair and gordon brown being read the riot act during a meeting of the parliamentary labour party. the views expressed by both backbenchers and labour peers over the claimed squabbling between the two men starkly demonstrated the widely-held view within the labour party that the two most powerful figures in the government are jeopardising the next election. as one hugely-disgruntled backbencher said before the meeting:  it is time they realised it s not just my seat they are threatening but if they go on like this they could put the election in doubt.  it is a sentiment that is now running throughout the labour benches with mps eager to underline the message to their leaders to stop the squabbling and get on with the job at hand.  as paul flynn said:  what has deeply upset the party is in this time of all times  when we wanted to come together  we wanted to lead on the global issues  to change politics for the next decade  the whole thing was wrecked by a piece of childishness by the two main people in the party  two people we greatly respect.   stephen pound echoed the message  saying:  we know that the one thing that could entirely jeopardise what we are trying to achieve  not for the labour party but for this country  is the appearance of division. we remember the 1980s . they backed the suggestion that unless the squabbling stopped  the people briefing on behalf of the two men would be  named and shamed . the dressing down appears to have done the trick  with mr brown joining his alleged rival alan milburn - who the prime minister put in charge of election planning in mr brown s stead - and deputy prime minister john prescott at an election poster launch. but the effect of all this is to have achieved two things. firstly  nobody is attempting to suggest any more that the stories of the rift between the chancellor and the prime minister are fictions created by the media and authors. even mr prescott admitted that  had he still been a backbencher  he would have been giving mr blair and mr brown the same message.  secondly it has also underlined the view that the election campaign has  to all intents and purposes  kicked off. but whether the telling off and the subsequent change in behaviour by the two men will do any good - or can even be sustained through the campaign - remains to be seen.  even as the mps were expressing their fears it emerged that  while mr brown is in africa for a week  the prime minister is to deliver a keynote speech on election themes for a third term. and he is expected to repeat his recent insistence that the next manifesto will be  new  labour through and through. similarly  some were pointing out that the chancellor  during the election poster launch  once again refused to deny the claim that he told the prime minister he could never trust anything he said. none the less  what some believe now is that the effect of the warnings from the backbenchers will actually be to silence the brown camp  effectively strengthening the prime minister s hand. for example  will those brownite briefers suggest their man is unhappy at the prime minister s timing or subject matter  as may have been the case in the past  what all seem agreed on  however  is that this sniping simply cannot be allowed to go on through the election campaign. mind you  we have heard similar pledges before.,labour mp fear squabbl one thing certain stiffen spine labour mp prospect lose seat gener elect larg fear lead toni blair gordon brown read riot act meet parliamentari labour parti view express backbench labour peer claim squabbl two men starkli demonstr widelyheld view within labour parti two power figur govern jeopardis next elect one hugelydisgruntl backbench say meet time realis seat threaten go like could put elect doubt sentiment run throughout labour bench mp eager underlin messag leader stop squabbl get job hand paul flynn say deepli upset parti time time want come togeth want lead global issu chang polit next decad whole thing wreck piec childish two main peopl parti two peopl greatli respect stephen pound echo messag say know one thing could entir jeopardis tri achiev labour parti countri appear divis rememb s back suggest unless squabbl stop peopl brief behalf two men would name shame dress appear do trick mr brown join alleg rival alan milburn prime minist put charg elect plan mr brown stead deputi prime minist john prescott elect poster launch effect achiev two thing firstli nobodi attempt suggest stori rift chancellor prime minist fiction creat medium author even mr prescott admit still backbench would give mr blair mr brown messag secondli also underlin view elect campaign intent purpos kick whether tell subsequ chang behaviour two men good even sustain campaign remain see even mp express fear emerg mr brown africa week prime minist deliv keynot speech elect theme third term expect repeat recent insist next manifesto new labour similarli point chancellor elect poster launch refus deni claim told prime minist could never trust anyth say none less believ effect warn backbench actual silenc brown camp effect strengthen prime minist hand exampl brownit briefer suggest man unhappi prime minist time subject matter may case past seem agre howev snipe simpli allow go elect campaign mind heard similar pledg
598,47,jamieson issues warning to bigots scotland s justice minister has warned bigoted soccer fans that she wants to hit them  where it hurts most  by banning them from matches.  cathy jamieson said exclusion orders are one of a series of measures being considered in the scottish executive campaign against sectarianism. she praised celtic and rangers for their work in tackling the problem. however  the minister said stopping sectarian abuse associated with old firm matches is a key objective. ms jamieson was speaking ahead of the third round scottish cup clash between the glasgow clubs at parkhead on sunday. the sectarianism long associated with sections of the support from both clubs has become a significant target for the executive. last week ms jamieson and first minister jack mcconnell met supporters  representatives from both clubs to discuss the issue.  they plan to hold an anti-sectarian summit next month with officials from the clubs  church leaders  senior police officers and local authority chiefs among those to be invited. speaking on bbc radio scotland s sunday live programme  ms jamieson described friday s meeting as  very productive  and said putting the squeeze on the bigots would be a key aim. ms jamieson stressed that sectarianism has not been confined to football but it can act as a  trigger  for tensions and violence. clubs have taken action in the past to ban troublesome fans and supporters  groups expressed their desire to ensure that the game is no longer tainted by the problem.  ms jamieson said the executive should have a role in tackling the soccer troublemakers. she said:  we can t get away from the fact that in some instances some of the religious hatred that some people try to associate with football boils over into violence.  that is the kind of thing we want to stop and that s the kind of thing supporters  groups are very clear they don t want to be part of either  and they will work with us to try and deal with that.   ms jamieson praised the police for their action and said:  the police do want to identify whether there are particular individuals who are going over the top and inciting hatred or violence - they will crack down very effectively on them.  we have of course already indicated that we will consider the introduction of banning orders to give additional powers to where there are people who are going over the top  who have made inappropriate behaviour at football matches  to be able to stop them attending the games.  that s the kind of thing that will hit those kind of people where it hurts the most in not allowing them to attend the games   she said. praising celtic and rangers for their efforts  she said:  i don t think there is any doubt that we have seen some positive moves from the clubs.  both rangers and celtic football clubs have been involved in working with the executive to produce  for example  an educational pack for young people.,jamieson issu warn bigot scotland justic minist warn bigot soccer fan want hit hurt ban match cathi jamieson say exclus order one seri measur consid scottish execut campaign sectarian prais celtic ranger work tackl problem howev minist say stop sectarian abus associ old firm match key object m jamieson speak ahead third round scottish cup clash glasgow club parkhead sunday sectarian long associ section support club becom signific target execut last week m jamieson first minist jack mcconnel met support repres club discus issu plan hold antisectarian summit next month offici club church leader senior polic offic local author chief among invit speak bbc radio scotland sunday live programm m jamieson describ friday meet product say put squeez bigot would key aim m jamieson stress sectarian confin footbal act trigger tension violenc club take action past ban troublesom fan support group express desir ensur game longer taint problem m jamieson say execut role tackl soccer troublemak say get away fact instanc religi hatr peopl tri associ footbal boil violenc kind thing want stop kind thing support group clear want part either work u tri deal m jamieson prais polic action say polic want identifi whether particular individu go top incit hatr violenc crack effect cours alreadi indic consid introduct ban order give addit power peopl go top make inappropri behaviour footbal match abl stop attend game kind thing hit kind peopl hurt allow attend game say prais celtic ranger effort say think doubt see posit move club ranger celtic footbal club involv work execut produc exampl educ pack young peopl
599,632,dollar gains on greenspan speech the dollar has hit its highest level against the euro in almost three months after the federal reserve head said the us trade deficit is set to stabilise.  and alan greenspan highlighted the us government s willingness to curb spending and rising household savings as factors which may help to reduce it. in late trading in new york  the dollar reached $1.2871 against the euro  from $1.2974 on thursday. market concerns about the deficit has hit the greenback in recent months. on friday  federal reserve chairman mr greenspan s speech in london ahead of the meeting of g7 finance ministers sent the dollar higher after it had earlier tumbled on the back of worse-than-expected us jobs data.  i think the chairman s taking a much more sanguine view on the current account deficit than he s taken for some time   said robert sinche  head of currency strategy at bank of america in new york.  he s taking a longer-term view  laying out a set of conditions under which the current account deficit can improve this year and next.   worries about the deficit concerns about china do  however  remain. china s currency remains pegged to the dollar and the us currency s sharp falls in recent months have therefore made chinese export prices highly competitive. but calls for a shift in beijing s policy have fallen on deaf ears  despite recent comments in a major chinese newspaper that the  time is ripe  for a loosening of the peg. the g7 meeting is thought unlikely to produce any meaningful movement in chinese policy. in the meantime  the us federal reserve s decision on 2 february to boost interest rates by a quarter of a point - the sixth such move in as many months - has opened up a differential with european rates. the half-point window  some believe  could be enough to keep us assets looking more attractive  and could help prop up the dollar. the recent falls have partly been the result of big budget deficits  as well as the us s yawning current account gap  both of which need to be funded by the buying of us bonds and assets by foreign firms and governments. the white house will announce its budget on monday  and many commentators believe the deficit will remain at close to half a trillion dollars.,dollar gain greenspan speech dollar hit high level euro almost three month feder reserv head say u trade deficit set stabilis alan greenspan highlight u govern willing curb spend rise household save factor may help reduc late trade new york dollar reach euro thursday market concern deficit hit greenback recent month friday feder reserv chairman mr greenspan speech london ahead meet g financ minist sent dollar high earlier tumbl back worsethanexpect u job data think chairman take much sanguin view current account deficit take time say robert sinch head currenc strategi bank america new york take longerterm view lay set condit current account deficit improv year next worri deficit concern china howev remain china currenc remain peg dollar u currenc sharp fall recent month therefor make chine export price highli competit call shift beij polici fall deaf ear despit recent comment major chine newspap time ripe loosen peg g meet thought unlik produc meaning movement chine polici meantim u feder reserv decis februari boost interest rate quarter point sixth move mani month open differenti european rate halfpoint window believ could enough keep u asset look attract could help prop dollar recent fall partli result big budget deficit well u yawn current account gap need fund buy u bond asset foreign firm govern white hous announc budget monday mani comment believ deficit remain close half trillion dollar
600,1347,ex-pm lord callaghan dies aged 92 former labour prime minister lord callaghan has died on the eve of his 93rd birthday.  he passed away at home in east sussex  just 11 days after his wife audrey died aged 91. lord callaghan  who leaves a son and two daughters  was the longest living former british pm in history. he entered downing street in 1976 after the resignation of harold wilson. prime minister tony blair called him a  giant  of the labour movement. he held each of the major offices of chancellor  home secretary  foreign secretary and prime minister during his career and became lord callaghan of cardiff in 1987.  chancellor gordon brown said the former pm would be  mourned throughout the world .  it was a commitment to public service that brought jim callaghan into parliament in 1945  and while jim rose to the top he never forgot his roots.  former cabinet colleague lord hattersley said his first reaction on hearing the news was  immense sadness .   it was not a major surprise - i knew what a blow the death of his wife audrey was a few days ago   he said.  he was a decent kindly man who helped me and my generation of politicians immensely.   the labour party and the country will be poorer without him.  conservative peer lord heseltine said that despite their political differences  he and lord callaghan became friends.  you don t get to the premiership unless you have a streak of determination   he said.  but i saw the other side of jim callaghan  he became a personal friend in a way  and my family and i were very fond of him.  tory leader michael howard said he would be remembered with  affection and respect . liberal democrat leader charles kennedy said:  when i was first elected in 1983 as the youngest mp  he was the  father of the house  and as such took a very keen interest in my early days in parliament.   he was always full of warmth and wisdom.  born in 1912 and educated at portsmouth northern secondary school  lord callaghan became a clerk at the inland revenue. he enlisted in the royal navy in 1942 and rose to the rank of lieutenant. elected for a cardiff constituency at the 1945 general election  he represented cardiff seats for more than 40 years. after serving as a junior minister in the attlee government  he became chancellor of the exchequer when labour returned to power in 1964.  with sterling under pressure  he resisted devaluation for three years  before being forced into it in 1967. his political career was not without controversy. when he refused to support prime minister harold wilson and dame barbara castle over the latter s trade union manifesto  in place of strife  in 1968  he said:  i am not going to resign. they will have to throw me out . when home secretary  he ordered british troops to march into the streets of belfast to protect catholic civilians amid rising violence - a decision that has dominated british politics into the 21st century.  as foreign secretary in the early 1970s  lord callaghan kept an open mind about the uk s entry into the common market  seeing the advantages of the uk s entry. he once travelled to idi amin s uganda in 1975 to plead for the life of a british lecturer  dennis hills  who was under a death sentence for treason.  his political life was often tempered by battles against the hard left of the party. in the autumn of 1978  before the  winter of discontent  when trade unions carried out strikes that brought the country to a standstill  lord callaghan refused to hold an early election which may have delivered a labour victory. as garbage lay uncollected in the streets and hospital staff  council workers and even gravediggers stayed off work  lord callaghan failed to predict the mood of the country. when britain went to the polls in 1979  tory leader margaret thatcher was swept into power in a landslide victory  and lord callaghan resigned as labour leader.,expm lord callaghan die age former labour prime minist lord callaghan die eve rd birthday pas away home east sussex day wife audrey die age lord callaghan leav son two daughter long live former british pm histori enter down street resign harold wilson prime minist toni blair call giant labour movement held major offic chancellor home secretari foreign secretari prime minist career becam lord callaghan cardiff chancellor gordon brown say former pm would mourn throughout world commit public servic brought jim callaghan parliament jim rise top never forgot root former cabinet colleagu lord hattersley say first reaction hear news immens sad major surpris knew blow death wife audrey day ago say decent kindli man help gener politician immens labour parti countri poorer without conserv peer lord heseltin say despit polit differ lord callaghan becam friend get premiership unless streak determin say saw side jim callaghan becam person friend way famili fond torus leader michael howard say would rememb affect respect liber democrat leader charl kennedi say first elect young mp father hous take keen interest earli day parliament alway full warmth wisdom born educ portsmouth northern secondari school lord callaghan becam clerk inland revenu enlist royal navi rise rank lieuten elect cardiff constitu gener elect repres cardiff seat year serv junior minist attle govern becam chancellor exchequ labour return power sterl pressur resist devalu three year forc polit career without controversi refus support prime minist harold wilson dame barbara castl latter trade union manifesto place strife say go resign throw home secretari order british troop march street belfast protect cathol civilian amid rise violenc decis domin british polit st centuri foreign secretari earli s lord callaghan kept open mind uk entri common market see advantag uk entri travel idi amin uganda plead life british lectur denni hill death sentenc treason polit life often temper battl hard left parti autumn winter discont trade union carri strike brought countri standstil lord callaghan refus hold earli elect may deliv labour victori garbag lay uncollect street hospit staff council worker even gravedigg stay work lord callaghan fail predict mood countri britain go poll torus leader margaret thatcher swept power landslid victori lord callaghan resign labour leader

605,1742,us state acts to stop  spammers  us state texas has filed a lawsuit against two men believed to be among the world s top five spammers.  it is seeking millions of dollars in damages in a civil lawsuit filed earlier this week. the texas attorney general said it started the legal action as messages sent by the alleged spammers broke three laws governing e-mail marketing. the company named in the lawsuit denied any wrongdoing and said it complied with all relevant laws.  the texas lawsuit was filed against ryan samuel pitylak  a university oftexas student  and mark stephen trotter of california. both are thought to be the top executives in three companies - payperaction llc.  leadplex llc. and leadplex inc - that are suspected of sending out many millions of unwanted e-mail messages.  illegal spam must be stopped   said greg abbott  texas attorney general announcing the legal action.  spam is one of the most aggravating and pervasive problems facing consumers today.  the attorney general alleges that messages sent by mr pitylak and mr trotter s companies broke the 2003 controlling the assault of non-solicited pornography and marketing act (can-spam) as well as the texas electronic mail and solicitation act and texas deceptive trade practices act. all three acts confer cash penalties for each violation of their terms. if the men are found guilty and all penalties are applied  the two men could face a damages bill running into millions. mr abbott said the messages sent by the pair broke laws by using misleading subject lines  not identifying themselves as adverts and offering services for which they had no licence to do so in texas. lawyers for the alleged spammers said the lawsuit was groundless and the two men would defend themselves strongly against the accusations.  leadplex and payperaction are legitimate internet marketing companies that are in complete compliance with the federal can-spam act   said lin hughes  speaking on behalf of mr pitylak and mr trotter. in a similar move the us federal trade commission (ftc) has won a court order that stops an international group of spammers sending sexually explicit e-mail. the ftc took the action because the messages being sent violated several parts of the can-spam act. in particular  the pornographic messages did not identify themselves as being sexually explicit  had deceptive subject headings  did not have working opt-out mechanisms  failed to mention they were adverts and did not give the sender s real world address. the court order stops the spammers sending e-mail and freezes assets prior to a hearing on a permanent injunction.,u state act stop spammer u state texa file lawsuit two men believ among world top five spammer seek million dollar damag civil lawsuit file earlier week texa attorney gener say start legal action messag sent alleg spammer broke three law govern email market compani name lawsuit deni wrongdo say compli relev law texa lawsuit file ryan samuel pitylak univers oftexa student mark stephen trotter california thought top execut three compani payperact llc leadplex llc leadplex inc suspect send mani million unwant email messag illeg spam must stop say greg abbott texa attorney gener announc legal action spam one aggrav pervas problem face consum today attorney gener alleg messag sent mr pitylak mr trotter compani broke control assault nonsolicit pornographi market act canspam well texa electron mail solicit act texa decept trade practic act three act confer cash penalti violat term men found guilti penalti appli two men could face damag bill run million mr abbott say messag sent pair broke law use mislead subject line identifi advert offer servic licenc texa lawyer alleg spammer say lawsuit groundless two men would defend strongli accus leadplex payperact legitim internet market compani complet complianc feder canspam act say lin hugh speak behalf mr pitylak mr trotter similar move u feder trade commiss ftc court order stop intern group spammer send sexual explicit email ftc take action messag sent violat sever part canspam act particular pornograph messag identifi sexual explicit decept subject head work optout mechan fail mention advert give sender real world address court order stop spammer send email freez asset prior hear perman injunct

608,400,lib dems   bold  election policy charles kennedy has told voters his liberal democrats will offer them an  honest choice  at the next general election.  with the other two big parties battling over which will impose the lowest taxes  mr kennedy is going into the looming election pledged to increase taxation. it is a bold policy and certainly ensures there is that choice between the lib dems and the other two. with his party s previous pledge to increase taxes by one penny in the pound to spend on public services already adopted by the government  he has switched tack. now he is promising to levy a  modest  increase of the same amount on earnings over £100 000 a year to allow him to finance a series of pledges. they are to scrap student fees  finance free long term care for the elderly and replace the council tax with a local income tax. that last policy will also see about 3% of the most well off paying more while others  pensioners in particular  will pay less.  labour and the tories have attacked his policies as both unworkable and not properly costed.  inevitably they insist there is no need to raise taxes to fund improvements in services. the tories claim they can improve services and cut taxes through £35bn efficiency savings  while labour has offered £22bn savings but has yet to map out precise tax proposals  although there is little chance they will propose increases. in many ways the argument between the lib dems and the others over taxation and spending echo the sort of arguments that raged between labour and the tories in the 1980s and early 1990s. but  unlike the old tory-labour debate  he believes voters are ready to see  modest  tax increases on the well off in order to fund improvements in services. that is a view partly endorsed by recent polls suggesting people would rather have cash spent on public services than tax cuts.  similarly there is a different tone to the lib dem approach to asylum and immigration  with mr kennedy stressing politicians should not  foment an artificial debate  about immigration and attacking michael howard s proposals for quotas. once again  with the two other big parties singing similar songs on immigration  mr kennedy is stressing the different  more liberal approach of his party. mr kennedy was also in buoyant mood over his party s election chances  declaring the tories were not going to be  significant players  in the poll. he repeated his pledge not to do post-election deals with either party after the election. mr kennedy went on to suggest the re-election of a labour government with a small majority would amount to a  massive vote of no confidence   in tony blair s government. that suggests the lib dem leader believes he may well find himself in a powerful  even pivotal position in a vastly different house of commons after the next election. it is a dream the third party has dreamed many times before.,lib dem bold elect polici charl kennedi told voter liber democrat offer honest choic next gener elect two big parti battl impos low tax mr kennedi go loom elect pledg increas taxat bold polici certainli ensur choic lib dem two parti previou pledg increas tax one penni pound spend public servic alreadi adopt govern switch tack promis levi modest increas amount earn £ year allow financ seri pledg scrap student fee financ free long term care elderli replac council tax local incom tax last polici also see well pay other pension particular pay less labour torus attack polici unwork properli cost inevit insist need rais tax fund improv servic torus claim improv servic cut tax £bn effici save labour offer £bn save yet map precis tax propos although littl chanc propos increas mani way argument lib dem other taxat spend echo sort argument rage labour torus s earli s unlik old torylabour debat believ voter readi see modest tax increas well order fund improv servic view partli endors recent poll suggest peopl would rather cash spent public servic tax cut similarli differ tone lib dem approach asylum immigr mr kennedi stress politician foment artifici debat immigr attack michael howard propos quota two big parti sing similar song immigr mr kennedi stress differ liber approach parti mr kennedi also buoyant mood parti elect chanc declar torus go signific player poll repeat pledg postelect deal either parti elect mr kennedi go suggest reelect labour govern small major would amount massiv vote confid toni blair govern suggest lib dem leader believ may well find power even pivot posit vastli differ hous common next elect dream third parti dream mani time
609,1579,golden rule boost for chancellor chancellor gordon brown has been given a £2.1bn boost in his attempts to meet his golden economic rule  which allows him to borrow only for investment.  the extra leeway came after the office for national statistics said it had been measuring road expenditure data wrongly over the past five years. it comes just weeks ahead of the budget and an expected general election. shadow chancellor oliver letwin said:  at best the timing of these changes is very convenient for the government.   a review by the ons found it had made a mistake by  double counting  some spending on roads since 1998/9. correcting the error would mean reducing current expenditure and increasing net investment  thus helping mr brown to meet his  golden rule  of borrowing only to invest over the economic cycle. economists speculated that it might also allow for some vote-catching measures in the budget.  the changes by the ons increase the current budget measure for the past five years by £2.1bn in total. mr letwin said:  this is a very murky area... there will inevitably be suspicions that the figures are being fiddled.  the conservatives also said mr brown would still be forced to raise taxes after the general election to fill an annual £10.5bn  black hole  in the nation s coffers. but the treasury said there would be no relaxation of economic discipline and the golden rule would be met even without the data revisions.  in january the independent institute for fiscal studies (ifs) said mr brown would need to raise taxes to get public finances onto the track predicted in last year s budget. it also said the government might narrowly miss its  golden rule  if the current economic cycle ended in 2005/06. after the ons announcement  economists said there could also be a proportionate boost to the current budget in 2004/05 of about £400m.  none of this changes the big picture of a dramatic deterioration in the overall fiscal position over the last four or five years   said jonathan loynes  chief uk economist at capital economics.  accordingly  it seems very likely that some form of fiscal consolidation will be required in due course.,golden rule boost chancellor chancellor gordon brown give £bn boost attempt meet golden econom rule allow borrow invest extra leeway come offic nation statist say measur road expenditur data wrongli past five year come week ahead budget expect gener elect shadow chancellor oliv letwin say best time chang conveni govern review on found make mistak doubl count spend road sinc correct error would mean reduc current expenditur increas net invest thu help mr brown meet golden rule borrow invest econom cycl economist specul might also allow votecatch measur budget chang on increas current budget measur past five year £bn total mr letwin say murki area inevit suspicion figur fiddl conserv also say mr brown would still forc rais tax gener elect fill annual £bn black hole nation coffer treasuri say would relax econom disciplin golden rule would met even without data revis januari independ institut fiscal studi if say mr brown would need rais tax get public financ onto track predict last year budget also say govern might narrowli miss golden rule current econom cycl end on announc economist say could also proportion boost current budget £m none chang big pictur dramat deterior overal fiscal posit last four five year say jonathan loyn chief uk economist capit econom accordingli seem like form fiscal consolid requir due cours
610,2072,lesotho textile workers lose jobs six foreign-owned textile factories have closed in lesotho  leaving 6 650 garment workers jobless  union officers told the ap news agency.  factory workers union secretary general billy macaefa blamed the closures on the end of worldwide textile quotas. the quotas for developing nations  ended on 1 january  gave them a set share of the rich countries  markets. they also limited the amount countries like china could export to the big markets of the united states and eu.   we understand that some (owners)... were complaining that the south african rand was strong against the us dollar  and they were losing when exporting textiles and clothing to the united states   mr macaefa said at a news briefing in the capital  maseru. lesotho s currency  the maloti  is fixed to the rand.  but we suspect that they left the country unceremoniously because of the end of quotas introduced by the world trade organization.  he said the six factories were leisure garments  modern garments  precious six garments  tw garments  lesotho hats and vogue landmark. the owners - two from taiwan  two from china  one from mauritius and one from malaysia - left over the december holiday period without informing or paying their employees  he said.  union leaders and trade campaigners have been warning that developing nations such as lesotho  sri lanka  and bangaldesh could lose thousands of jobs once the quotas were lifted. in the mountainous country surrounded by south africa  it is feared as many as 50 000 textile workers could lose their jobs  and mr mafeca said he expected more companies to leave. the assistance of a us law had given lesotho s textiles duty-free access to north american markets. the african growth and opportunity act (agoa)  gave sub-saharan countries preferential access to the us market for apparel and textile products as well as a wide range of other goods. a lesotho government news briefing is expected on wednesday.,lesotho textil worker lose job six foreignown textil factori close lesotho leav garment worker jobless union offic told ap news agenc factori worker union secretari gener billi macaefa blame closur end worldwid textil quota quota develop nation end januari give set share rich countri market also limit amount countri like china could export big market unit state eu understand owner complain south african rand strong u dollar lose export textil cloth unit state mr macaefa say news brief capit maseru lesotho currenc loti fix rand suspect left countri unceremoni end quota introduc world trade organ say six factori leisur garment modern garment preciou six garment tw garment lesotho hat vogu landmark owner two taiwan two china one mauritiu one malaysia left decemb holiday period without inform pay employe say union leader trade campaign warn develop nation lesotho sri lanka bangaldesh could lose thousand job quota lift mountain countri surround south africa fear mani textil worker could lose job mr mafeca say expect compani leav assist u law give lesotho textil dutyfre access north american market african growth opportun act agoa give subsaharan countri preferenti access u market apparel textil product well wide rang good lesotho govern news brief expect wednesday

613,1008,child access law shake-up planned parents who refuse to allow former partners contact with their children could be electronically tagged under plans being considered by ministers.  curfews and community service orders were other options which could be used if court orders to allow parental access were defied  lord falconer said. the constitutional affairs secretary outlined some of the plans on tuesday. he denied fathers  activists had forced the changes  telling the bbc  there is a recognition that something is wrong . between 15 000 and 20 000 couples go to court to resolve access disputes each year  although in nine out of 10 separations there is no court intervention.  lord falconer told bbc radio 4 s today programme he hoped voluntary mediation could help solve disputes before they reached court. but he opposed compulsory mediation  saying that it would lead to many people taking part with the wrong attitude. other plans include:  - parenting plans to give advice on access arrangements  based on real-life examples that have worked in the past   - extending in-court conciliation - more informal hearings before contested court cases   - better access to legal  emotional and practical advice by telephone and internet   - legal aid changes to give incentives for early resolution of disputes.  judges can already jail parents who breach contact orders but that was a  nuclear option  which was rarely used as it was not seen as being in the child s interests  a spokesman said. the aim of the new legislation was to provide a  medium range  of penalties  such as fines  community service orders  compulsory anger management or parenting classes or curfews.  failure to comply with these measures could result in offenders being electronically tagged. on the possibility of tagging uncooperative parents  lord falconer said:  tagging may be going too far  but let s have a debate about that.  full details of the new powers will not be revealed until a bill is published  in the next two weeks   a spokesman said.  the government s proposals have met with disapproval from fathers  rights groups. john ison  from the controversial group fathers 4 justice  said:  it is very disappointing. what we have got is a cynical case of recycling existing legislation.  jim parton  from families need fathers  said the new proposals  lacked compulsion .   we would like to see couples develop a plan and then have it as a source of a court order - then you know where you stand  you know what the minimum access is.  otherwise  you see people make agreements which then fall apart.  mr parton said he had been told by children s minister margaret hodge there was not enough time to pass the bill through parliament before the general election  which is likely to take place in may.  the conservatives have called for an equal split between parents on access to be made law. theresa may  shadow secretary for the family  told bbc radio 4 s today programme that the government s plans were  inadequate  and were  papering over the cracks of the current system . she said a conservative government would bring a  radical reform  of the family courts  as well as enforcing a  legal presumption of co-parenting and compulsory mediation .  we want to make courts the last resort  rather than the first resort   she added. the government says children cannot simply be divided up  like property  when a marriage collapses. the liberal democrats have argued for flexibility in deciding access rules  rather than having  rigid targets .,child access law shakeup plan parent refus allow former partner contact child could electron tag plan consid minist curfew commun servic order option could use court order allow parent access defi lord falcon say constitut affair secretari outlin plan tuesday deni father activist forc chang tell bbc recognit someth wrong coupl go court resolv access disput year although nine separ court intervent lord falcon told bbc radio today programm hope voluntari mediat could help solv disput reach court oppos compulsori mediat say would lead mani peopl take part wrong attitud plan includ parent plan give advic access arrang base reallif exampl work past extend incourt concili inform hear contest court case well access legal emot practic advic telephon internet legal aid chang give incent earli resolut disput judg alreadi jail parent breach contact order nuclear option rare use see child interest spokesman say aim new legisl provid medium rang penalti fine commun servic order compulsori anger manag parent class curfew failur compli measur could result offend electron tag possibl tag uncoop parent lord falcon say tag may go far let debat full detail new power reveal bill publish next two week spokesman say govern propos met disapprov father right group john ison controversi group father justic say disappoint get cynic case recycl exist legisl jim parton famili need father say new propos lack compuls would like see coupl develop plan sourc court order know stand know minimum access otherwis see peopl make agreement fall apart mr parton say told child minist margaret hodg enough time pas bill parliament gener elect like take place may conserv call equal split parent access make law theresa may shadow secretari famili told bbc radio today programm govern plan inadequ paper crack current system say conserv govern would bring radic reform famili court well enforc legal presumpt copar compulsori mediat want make court last resort rather first resort ad govern say child simpli divid like properti marriag collaps liber democrat argu flexibl decid access rule rather rigid target

615,2164,asia shares defy post-quake gloom indonesian  indian and hong kong stock markets reached record highs.  investors seemed to feel that some of the worst-affected areas were so under-developed that the tragedy would have little impact on asia s listed firms.  obviously with a lot of loss of life  a lot of time is needed to clean up the mess  bury the people and find the missing   said abn amro s eddie wong.  [but] it s not necessarily a really big thing in the economic sense.   india s bombay stock exchange inched slightly above its previous record close on wednesday. expectations of strong corporate earnings in 2005 drove the indonesian stock exchange in jakarta to a record high on wednesday. in hong kong  the hang seng index may be benefiting in part from the potential for its listed property companies to gain from rebuilding contracts in the tsunami-affected regions of south east asia. in sri lanka  some economists have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost. sri lanka s stock market has fallen about 5% since the weekend  but it is still 40% higher than at the start of 2004.  thailand may lose 30bn baht (£398m; $768m) in earnings from tourism over the next three months  according to tourism minister sontaya kunplome.  in the affected provinces  he expects the loss of tourism revenue to be offset by government reconstruction spending. thailand intends to spend a similar sum - around 30bn baht - on the rebuilding work.  it will take until the fourth quarter of next year before tourist visitors in phuket and five other provinces return to their normal level   said naris chaiyasoot  director general at the ministry s fiscal policy office. in the maldives the cost of reconstruction could wipe out economic growth  according to a government spokesman.  our nation is in peril here   said ahmed shaheed  the chief government spokesman. he estimated the economic cost of the disaster at hundreds of millions of dollars. the maldives has gross domestic product of $660m.  it won t be surprising if the cost exceeds our gdp   he said.  in the last few years  we made great progress in our standard of living - the united nations recognised this. now we see this can disappear in a few days  a few minutes.  shaheed noted that investment in a single tourist resort - the economic mainstay - could run to $40m. between 10 and 12 of the 80-odd resorts have been severely damaged  and a similar number have suffered significant damage.  however  many experts  including the world bank  have pointed out that it is still difficult to assess the magnitude of the disaster and its likely economic impact. in part  this is because of its scale  and because delivering aid and recovering the dead remain priorities.  calculators will have to wait   said an imf official in a briefing on wednesday.  the financial and world community will be turning toward reconstruction efforts and at that point people will begin to have a sense of the financial impact.,asia share defi postquak gloom indonesian indian hong kong stock market reach record high investor seem feel worstaffect area underdevelop tragedi would littl impact asia list firm obvious lot loss life lot time need clean mess buri peopl find miss say abn amro eddi wong necessarili realli big thing econom sen india bombay stock exchang inch slightli previou record close wednesday expect strong corpor earn drove indonesian stock exchang jakarta record high wednesday hong kong hang seng index may benefit part potenti list properti compani gain rebuild contract tsunamiaffect region south east asia sri lanka economist say much annual growth may lose sri lanka stock market fall sinc weekend still high start thailand may lose bn baht £m m earn tourism next three month accord tourism minist sontaya kunplom affect provinc expect loss tourism revenu offset govern reconstruct spend thailand intend spend similar sum around bn baht rebuild work take fourth quarter next year tourist visitor phuket five provinc return normal level say nari chaiyasoot director gener ministri fiscal polici offic maldiv cost reconstruct could wipe econom growth accord govern spokesman nation peril say ahm shahe chief govern spokesman estim econom cost disast hundr million dollar maldiv gross domest product m surpris cost exce gdp say last year make great progress standard live unit nation recognis see disappear day minut shahe note invest singl tourist resort econom mainstay could run m odd resort sever damag similar number suffer signific damag howev mani expert includ world bank point still difficult ass magnitud disast like econom impact part scale deliv aid recov dead remain prioriti calcul wait say imf offici brief wednesday financi world commun turn toward reconstruct effort point peopl begin sen financi impact
616,881,roundabout continues nostalgia trip the new big-screen version of the magic roundabout  released in the uk on friday  is the latest attempt to turn children s television into box-office gold.  recent years have seen a less-than-successful adaptation of the 1960s puppet show thunderbirds and a moderately successful version of e nesbit s five children and it  previously filmed by the bbc in 1991. he-man and transformers  which were cartoon favourites in the 1980s  will soon receive their own costly makeovers. with screen versions of the a-team  the dukes of hazzard and even blake s seven on the cards  nostalgia is clearly big business. but some critics complain that these expensive takes on iconic series of yesteryear do not match up to our fond memories of the originals. the new version of the magic roundabout  which will be released as sprung! in the us  replaces the stop-motion models of the 1960s tv show with polished  computer-generated animation.  in a similar fashion  the 2004 thunderbirds used human actors and special effects in place of the original s puppets and models. the films are squarely pitched at younger audiences. pop stars robbie williams and kylie minogue provide voices in the magic roundabout  while the now-defunct boy band busted performed the thunderbirds theme song. but while some reviewers have been won over  there has nonetheless been a significant backlash.  this cg-animated adventure airbrushes the sly charm and trippy otherworldliness which made the 60s stop-motion roundabout a cult hit   writes stella papamichael on the bbc movies site.  and the recent puppet comedy team america: world police was in part provoked by its directors  outrage that gerry anderson s thunderbirds was remade without its signature mannequins. dan jolin  reviews editor of empire magazine  says classic children s tv shows have a built-in audience that make them ideal for reinvention.   i can understand why people are taking these intellectual properties and repackaging them for the kids of today.  but i think it s backfiring. what s next - the clangers on some distant planet  with some giant cgi soup dragons chasing after them   despite thunderbirds  disappointing global box-office performance - the film cost $42m (£22m) but only recouped $21m (£11m) - the nostalgia craze shows no signs of abating. it can therefore be only a matter of time before some other tv favourites receive the hollywood treatment.  after the success of garfield: the movie  britain s shabby tabby  surely deserves his own film vehicle. with only 13 episodes made of the 1974 series  there is plenty of room to explore the lives of the pink cat  professor yaffle and the mice of the marvellous mechanical mouse organ.  furry recyclers  have already had one big-screen outing - 1977 s wombling free. but with environmental issues still occupying our thoughts it is high time they made a comeback. advances in special effects technology could do wonders for the bbc s supernatural comedy  . and the success of pirates of the caribbean must surely herald a comeback for tv s most popular cartoon buccaneer   . it might also remind viewers the lewd character names often associated with the show never actually existed.  the magic roundabout is out in the uk on 11 february.    how about bringing catweazle to the big screen  he could give gandalf a run for his money!  thundercats!! i loved it. should be fun to see on the big screen  if some effort is put in! it will bring my youth back!  get your hands off the clangers! is nothing sacred   make a movie version of the banana splits!  what about keanu reeves and richard gere in a remake of the wooden tops  or perhaps robbie williams could get his much mooted acting career off the ground by taking on the role of andy pandy.  you forgot to mention the grearest of them all  danger mouse! but then again  it couldn t be better than the original series  could it   it s always nice to see these old toons re-released  but after the abysmal thunderbirds movie (and the song!) i think i ve been completely put off. just leave these classics alone as good memories.  i think remakes are a good idea. as the world moves on people tend to look more and more into the past to things that make them feel safe. i believe this is the whole reason  retro  has become so popular. as long as a remake does justice to the original then all it can do is create a wider audience and possibly entice a new generation of persons to enjoy and revive and old series. personally i d like to see cartoons such as transformers  thundercats and m.a.s.k. get full hollywood remakes.  leave them alone  why ruin something that we all have very fond memories of in the first place  the thunderbirds film was apalling  not a patch on the puppet series i grew up with and the magic roundabout will never be the same without the voice of eric thompson.  love to see transformers with real actors and cgi. and make it at least a 15 rating.  part of the reason for the success of such classics as the magic roundabout was that the characters were not the sweet and cuddly creatures that you would expect. they were moody  sarcastic  and rather human. just looking at the pictures of the animations for the new film show that these characteristics have not been preserved. dougal never smiled like that! films of this sort have an unfortunate habit of disneyfying everthing  and they just lose the real magic that made the show special in the first place.  i have fond memories of bod (not least of which because i look like him) and would like to see someone attempt to make it into a film. it s got all the right material for an american blockbuster - no plot and no story. bod would likely be played by tom cruise and would undoubtedly have a girlfriend or two.  it s all very well and good remaking these classic tv shows and films with all the latest technology for a  new  audience  but for me a lot of the original charm is lost when they do this  and seems more like a money making exercise to cash in on the original success of the programme than reinventing or improving it. it maybe that to an audience who have never seen the originals they can watch them without prejudice  but to people who have grown up with all these shows such as thunderbirds and magic roundabout which are part of our childhood  they are never going to live up to expectation. it does pose the question though that with all the long line of remakes being made  are film-makers running out of original ideas   all i can say is bring back danger mouse  probably the greatest kids  show ever. i recently re-watched some episodes and realised that there was a level of humour shown in danger mouse that was completely lost on me when i was a child.  there was a new captain pugwash cartoon made a couple of years back. again  like so many of these nostalgia programmes  the animation - this time computer created flat-cell like animation - failed to match the original s cut out paper technique for inventiveness  and was woefully inadequate. we live in a sampling world - the music industry has been pludering past decades for inspiration  clipping sounds from 20 years ago is much cheaper and easier that doing something new. seems that the film and tv is doing the same now - it s just cheaper to take ideas from the past and rework them  rather than being daring and trying something new.  it got to be mr.benn. the story line about a man who changes in a fancy dress shop  steps into a door way and appears in another time and place would be amazing! if they got a decent producer and writer the story line could be great. and who to play the lead role  well if it was a comedy then it would have to be someone like steve martin. if its going to be an adventure then johnny depp playing a role similar to the pirates of the caribbean character.  muffin the mule perhaps   after all  grannies and grandpas go to the cinema as well you know!  why can t the british film industry try making gerry anderson s ufo or captain scarlet  or saphire and steel  or the tomorrow people.  in today s media  it seems the past is the future. tv shows such as battlestar galactica have new remakes  dj s are sampling or re-working 70 s and 80 s music. even computer games from 10-15 years ago are getting modern re-workings. personally  i think it shows that no one has any originality any more! why not just leave our misty-eyed nostalgia alone.  mary  mungo and midge. but of course for most of the episodes the lift would be out of order and they would have to use the stairs. plus would mary be more of a vicky pollard character as she lives in a high rise council block  yeah but no but i wasn t even there!  i d like to see mr. benn  with brad pitt in the title role. sean connery could play the mysterious costume shop owner.  it demonstrates a profound lack of imagination in today s film-makers that they continually try to remake and remodel the past in an effort to cash in on nostalgia. there are plany of modern children s book that would make excellent films or tv programmes  why not use them instead of rehashing the past   mr. benn with rowan atkinson as the lead.  would have loved to see dungeons & dragons made  but unfortunately the film that it was made into didn t come up to scratch. the only one that isn t to be remade as yet is thundercats  which i d like to see.  i m an expat living in norway  and i recently went through a period of buying the dvds of many of my favourite children s programs for my 2 daughters. my dearest wish  however  is to see a feature length version of noggin the nog appear on the big screen!! very scandinavian...  rainbow!  i believe that childrens classics should be left well alone  and i will not be surprised if the magic roundabout does not do well at the box office  especially since it will be going up against the spongebob squarepants movie  popular among children because it s original  witty  and modern. the magic roundabout will never appeal to the children of today as it did all those many years ago.  how about classics like chorlton and the wheelies  rentaghost  terrahawks  bod.....oh the list could go on and on!!!  if a transformers movie is indeed on the cards then i ll be the first one on amazon buying a copy  eagerly waiting at the front door with a frothy mouth and a nervous twitch. repackage my childhood and sell it to me at an extortionate price! i don t care! till then i ll have to make do with the citreon c4 advert.  i d luv to see willow the wisp on the big screen but sadly without the late kenneth williams doing the voices it wouldnt be the same. and who remembers trap door voiced by the late willie rushden  superb children s programme. could morph hold his own in a big screen movie    or even jamie and the magic torch....hmmmmm  i could go on and on. danger mouse  at 34 i m showing my age. :-)  noggin the nog was one of the best children s programs. the problem with bringing it to the big screen is that no-one could approach oliver postgate s wonderful voices. so in general leave well alone. the originals are good because they are of their time and the methods used are an integral part of the story.  just imagine what could be achieved by using cgi in a remake of fingerbobs... the already disturbing hand antics of the bearded hippy  yoffi could take on a whole new level with a more life-like fingermouse  bob the builder  postman pat and fireman sam together in an epic adventure of fire  post and bricks. in the ultimate struggle to save the women they love from the evil clowns  krusty and gobo. will they triumph or will they fail miserably  find out this fall.  one puppet show that i personally would love to see made into a live action movie is joe 90. it would be worth the price of admission alone to see the large screen version of joe s car. of course  gerry anderson s supermarionation is a rich seam of material worthy of big-screen  big-budget action. it was only that thunderbirds the movie was targetted as a children t movie that really let it down. after all  the children that remember those shows with such affection are now the parents of children themselves.  it s only because the people who were children when these programmes were first shown have grown up and are plundering their childhoods  isn t it  i d hate to see bagpuss with perfect animation - i love that  done in a shed  clunkiness and you couldn t recreate the magic. perhaps if the remakes were done in a  look around you  mock-authentic style i might be interested ...  chorton and the wheelies or jamie and his magic torch; that would be mega!  this re-gurgitation of old films and tv shows makes me angry - it is corporate laziness resting on the safety of other people s ideas  because it guarantees to bring in the $$$. the same can be said of modern day pop bands who release other peoples material  will young etc. the sad fact is nostalgia sells big bucks in the short-term. the fact that they will be forgotten in 6 months time is irrelevant (e.g. starsky & hutch) hence  the market is saturated with this mindless drivel  but it can only be stopped if people stop buying it!  i pray they never do a remake of chorlton and the wheelies. i m only 27 and don t remember the series from when it was on tv  but have the set on dvd and it s a classic. the fact it s so great comes from the fact that there were very few special effects involved and compared to today s stuff it looks amateurish. thats the appeal though  it s so innocent (like chorlton himself) and it would be a real shame if they did remake it.,roundabout continu nostalgia trip new bigscreen version magic roundabout releas uk friday

617,46,franz man seeks government help franz ferdinand frontman alex kapranos has called for more government help for musicians  while taking part in an edinburgh lectures discussion.   for any cultural output to thrive there needs to be some kind of state input to that as well   he said. but kapranos warned against musicians being too closely linked with mps  at the university of edinburgh event.  i think the role of musicians is to question politicians rather than to go to bed with them   he said.  kapranos joined the prestigious lecture series to discuss scotland s role in making 21st century music.  there are elements of our musical output which require sustenance because they aren t self-sufficient   he said.  but so-called commercial music would benefit from investment as well.  he warned musicians against being allied to a particular party  however.  i don t know if having tea with politicians is always a good idea.   kapranos and his glasgow four-piece band have been nominated for five prizes at next week s brit awards  including best group and best album. their self-titled debut album won last year s mercury music prize and spawned three top 20 singles. he told the 300-strong audience at the university s reid hall that musicians should listen to a wide range of music and should not be restricted by stereotypes.  we say  i like this . because i listen to nirvana and korn i am a troubled individual  i m riddled with angst because i listen to chopin and debussy  i listen to kylie minogue and scissor sisters because i m upbeat and i like to party  i listen to wagner because i like the smell of napalm in the morning.  kapranos said there was a general  hostility  towards classical music  adding:  there is very little done to break that hostility other than classic fm.   he concluded:  we define ourselves as a nation by the way we encourage our creativity.  fellow speaker and classical composer james macmillan agreed:  we need to rediscover our ability to listen.  previous speakers at the edinburgh lectures series have included former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and author professor stephen hawking. kapranos described his appearance on wednesday as  more daunting by a long way  than their upcoming brits performance.  i don t really care about the brits   he said.  it s going to be great to go down but i have actually had to exercise part of my brain tonight.   i think the government should do more to help up-and-coming artists be discovered by scrapping the entertainment licences for live venues. also they should do more to help independent record labels have a louder voice within an industry dominated by commercialised major labels.  rather than expecting the government - i.e. the taxpayer - to fork out  why don t some of the megastars put something back in  some of britain s wealthiest people are musicians who have raked it in from albums  concerts etc. there are far more important demands on government funds.  if they can fund football  why not fund music   areas of the arts are funded by government and lottery grants  so why not music  we already have the opera receiving huge grants and it would clearly be beneficial for diversity in music to have the same opportunities in other areas of the music. the only problem would be how to judge what merits state cash.  the government has enough problems funding schools and health services. if alex kapranos genuinely thinks a multi-billion pound industry should also have government funding then his own education was seriously lacking and more money should be put into that.  as a scot living in england  i appreciate the value of scottish music and culture being a success  so i can see no problem with it! franz ferdinand  travis and snow patrol are just recent examples of the success scottish music can have in the world  so we should do what we scots are good at and support our own goods!  i think the issue is more fundamental: should the government be spending money on subsidising a multi-million pound industry when health and education are in such a sorry state  the answer is most definitely no. those people who are lucky enough to pursue their passion to get their pay cheque shouldn t be looking for government subsidies. i know that if i was lucky enough to be able to pursue my dream of show jumping i would want to finance myself until i was in a position to pursue corporate sponsorship.  yes the government should fund music - it brings joy to the masses.  there are already thousands of state-funded musicians out there sitting around  twiddling their thumbs on the  new deal . getting the government even more involved would only waste money that could be put to better use.  as long as the government was funding real talent it would be a great move. i would hate to see more pop idol-type funding of music though  as it would only serve to reinforce the stereotypes that alex talked about.  only if the proposals make financial sense. franz ferdinand must be paying serious amounts of tax on their record sales - if they d had a government grant to get started they d have more than paid it back by now  so the treasury would be making far more than it paid out. however  the government has better things to spend its money on than to give charity to everyone who decides they re a musician. the government shouldn t  fund  music - it should  invest  in music and those investments should be treated like any other investment.  i think the government needs to provide facilities and for young groups and bands to form and practise. the equipment is not cheap and can be well beyond the means of many people. however  i do feel this should be the extent of their role  to provide the conditions for the talent to flourish and let it go from there.  i do agree that the government should help to fund music but there is also a responsibility held by record companies! they generally always opt for the tried and tested and tend not to want to break any moulds or risk losing any money which ultimately  the directors are in the business for! if labels were more willing to put money forward towards smaller breakthrough acts then the government wouldn t have to fork out a great deal.  yeah  why not  music should be government funded  particularly the work of modern composers and veteran bands/artists and stuff. pop music pretty much rules the earth  so more attention should go to the other fraternities  i agree with funding the arts to make it more accessible to the public but i am not convinced that pop music requires financial support from the taxpayer. there is a great deal of money generated through pop music - perhaps a tax on pop could be ploughed into the public performance of other forms of music for everyone to enjoy. perhaps we could financially penalise really bad pop idol-style music - that is  the music industry sector without any artistic merit or originality whatsoever and that which is specifically designed to line the pockets of music producers. call it a tax on music  pollution   if you like.  though i really like franz ferdinand  i have to disagree with mr kapranos. once government gets their hand into the private sector  it will destroy the creative and possibly controversial avenues the artist pursues. many years ago  this was the case with the us nea  when the government started to question what was considered art for the money they were allotting. the solution mr kapranos should pursue would be privately-funded organizations  like save the music in the us.,franz man seek govern help franz ferdinand frontman alex kaprano call govern help musician take part edinburgh lectur discus cultur output thrive need kind state input

620,1941,iaaf awaits greek pair s response kostas kenteris and katerina thanou are yet to respond to doping charges from the international association of athletics federations (iaaf).  the greek pair were charged after missing a series of routine drugs tests in tel aviv  chicago and athens. they have until midnight on 16 december and an iaaf spokesman said:  we re sure their responses are on their way.  if they do not respond or their explanations are rejected  they will be provisionally banned from competition. they will then face a hearing in front of the greek federation  which will ultimately determine their fate. their former coach christos tzekos has also been charged with distributing banned substances. under iaaf rules  the athletes could receive a maximum one-year suspension. kenteris and thanou already face a criminal trial after being charged with avoiding a drug test on the eve of the athens olympics and then faking a motorcyle crash.  no date for the trial has yet been set and again tzekos is also facing charges. the iaaf issued an official warning to the trio last year after they were discovered training in qatar rather than in crete  where they had said they would be. all athletes must inform their national federations where they are at all times  so they can be available for out-of-competition drugs tests. but kenteris and thanou then went on to skip tests in tel aviv and chicago  when they decided to fly back to greece early. then just before the olympics  the pair dramatically missed another test in athens and withdrew from the games.,iaaf await greek pair respons kosta kenteri katerina thanou yet respond dope charg intern associ athlet feder iaaf greek pair charg miss seri routin drug test tel aviv chicago athen midnight decemb iaaf spokesman say sure respons way respond explan reject provision ban competit face hear front greek feder ultim determin fate former coach christo tzeko also charg distribut ban substanc iaaf rule athlet could receiv maximum oneyear suspens kenteri thanou alreadi face crimin trial charg avoid drug test eve athen olymp fake motorcyl crash date trial yet set tzeko also face charg iaaf issu offici warn trio last year discov train qatar rather crete say would athlet must inform nation feder time avail outofcompetit drug test kenteri thanou go skip test tel aviv chicago decid fli back greec earli olymp pair dramat miss anoth test athen withdrew game
621,1157,greek pair set for hearing kostas kenteris and katerina thanou will fight the provisional two-year bans imposed on them by the iaaf at an independent tribunal this weekend.  athletics  ruling body took action against the pair for failing to take drugs tests before the athens olympics. an independent tribunal of the greek track and field federation will meet to decide whether to ratify the sanction. the sprint duo face charges of failing to give information on their location and refusing to submit to a drugs test. kenteris  lawyer gregory ioannidis told bbc sport:  we refute both charges as unsubstantiated and illogical.  there have been certain breaches in the correct application of the rules on behalf of the sporting authorities and their officials  and these procedural breaches have also violated my client s rights.  there is also evidence that proves the fact that my client has been persecuted.  ioannidis  who is a law lecturer at the university of buckingham  added:  one of the important rights and foundations of law and justice - that the accused should be presumed innocent unless proved otherwise - has been tarnished.  the panel will also decide on the two-year ban imposed on the athletes  controversial coach christos tzekos by the iaaf. kenteris  the 2000 olympic 200m champion  and thanou  the women s 100m silver medallist from the same games in sydney  quit the olympics on 18 august after failing to give samples on the eve of the opening ceremony.  testers could not find them at the olympic village and the duo were later admitted to hospital after claiming to have been involved in a motorcycle accident. they also missed tests in tel aviv  chicago and athens before the games. in imposing two-year suspensions on the duo on 22 december  the iaaf described their explanations for missing the tests as  unacceptable . whatever the findings of the independent tribunal  all parties will have the right to appeal to the court of arbitration for sport. the tribunal hearing will take place at the hellenic olympic committee building. it will start at 1200 gmt on saturday and is expected to finish early next week. the tribunal panel will consist of five members - president konstantinos panagopoulos and panagiotis dimakos  haralabos hrisanthakis  stilianos perakis and ioannis karmis. kenteris and thanou also face criminal charges in greece for allegedly faking the motorcycle accident. eight criminal charges have been laid against the sprinters as well as tzekos  an eyewitness to the accident and hospital officials. but there has been speculation that the charges could be dropped.,greek pair set hear kosta kenteri katerina thanou fight provision twoyear ban impos iaaf independ tribun weekend athlet rule bodi take action pair fail take drug test athen olymp independ tribun greek track field feder meet decid whether ratifi sanction sprint duo face charg fail give inform locat refus submit drug test kenteri lawyer gregori ioannidi told bbc sport refut charg unsubstanti illog certain breach correct applic rule behalf sport author offici procedur breach also violat client right also evid prove fact client persecut ioannidi law lectur univers buckingham ad one import right foundat law justic accus presum innoc unless prove otherwis tarnish panel also decid twoyear ban impos athlet controversi coach christo tzeko iaaf kenteri olymp m champion thanou woman m silver medallist game sydney quit olymp august fail give sampl eve open ceremoni tester could find olymp villag duo later admit hospit claim involv motorcycl accid also miss test tel aviv chicago athen game impos twoyear suspens duo decemb iaaf describ explan miss test unaccept whatev find independ tribun parti right appeal court arbitr sport tribun hear take place hellen olymp committe build start gmt saturday expect finish earli next week tribun panel consist five member presid konstantino panagopoulo panagioti dimako haralabo hrisanthaki stiliano peraki ioanni karmi kenteri thanou also face crimin charg greec allegedli fake motorcycl accid eight crimin charg laid sprinter well tzeko eyewit accid hospit offici specul charg could drop

626,288,peers debate crown succession law peers are debating proposals to change the rules governing the succession to the throne.  labour peer lord dubs  succession to the crown bill aims to end the right of male heirs to succeed to the crown even if they have an older sister. the private member s bill would also abolish the ban on heirs to the throne marrying roman catholics. the fabian society s sundar katwala said the change was  long overdue  and that he expected a  warm response . the political reform group s general secretary told bbc radio 4 s today programme there were some  very out-dated features  at the heart of britain s constitution.   in 1998 the government said in principle it supported the idea of ending gender discrimination and that it would consult on how to come forward with its own measures.  we hope they are warm towards it and don t say this is the wrong time.  he pointed out that it was 30 years since the sex discrimination act and urged politicians on all sides to back the bill. mr katwala added:  this is long overdue. parliament will have to do it eventually  the government  and i hope all of the political parties  might think this is a very simple thing to have in their manifestos.   but he acknowledged that even if the bill did win support  it was unlikely to become law because the legislative programme is likely to be squeezed by the coming general election. he said he hoped the bill would be a  gentle nudge  to the government and suggested it would  demand a response . the bill  which is in the lords for its second reading  has been adopted by former chief whip ann taylor in the commons. the rule of succession is regulated not only through descent and tradition but also by the act of settlement which confirmed in 1701 that it was for parliament to determine the title to the throne.,peer debat crown success law peer debat propos chang rule govern success throne labour peer lord dub success crown bill aim end right male heir succeed crown even old sister privat member bill would also abolish ban heir throne marri roman cathol fabian societi sundar katwala say chang long overdu expect warm respons polit reform group gener secretari told bbc radio today programm outdat featur heart britain constitut govern say principl support idea end gender discrimin would consult come forward measur hope warm toward say wrong time point year sinc sex discrimin act urg politician side back bill mr katwala ad long overdu parliament eventu govern hope polit parti might think simpl thing manifesto acknowledg even bill win support unlik becom law legisl programm like squeez come gener elect say hope bill would gentl nudg govern suggest would demand respons bill lord second read adopt former chief whip ann taylor common rule success regul descent tradit also act settlement confirm parliament determin titl throne

631,331,yangtze electric s profits double yangtze electric power  the operator of china s three gorges dam  has said its profits more than doubled in 2004.  the firm has benefited from increased demand for electricity at a time when power shortages have hit cities and provinces across the country. as a hydroelectric-power generator it has not been hurt by higher coal costs. net income jumped to 3bn yuan in 2004 ($365m; £190m)  compared with 1.4bn yuan in 2003. sales surged to 6.2bn yuan  from 3bn yuan a year earlier. the figures topped analysts expectations  even though the rate of growth has slowed from 2003. analysts forecast that it is likely to decline further this year to a rate of expansion of closer to 20%.  yangtze electric has been expanding its output to meet demand driven by china s booming economy. the government has delayed the building of a number of power plants in an effort to rein in growth amid concerns that the economy may overheat. that has led to an energy crunch  with demand outstripping supply. earlier this month  work was halted on an underground power station  and a supply unit on the three gorges dam  as well as a power station on its sister xiluodu dam because of environmental worries. a total of 30 large-scale projects have been halted across the country for similar reasons. the three gorges dam project has led to more than half a million people being relocated and drawn criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists. its sister project  the xiluodu dam  is being built on the jinshajiang - or  river of golden sand  as the upper reaches of the yangtze are known.,yangtz electr profit doubl yangtz electr power oper china three gorg dam say profit doubl firm benefit increas demand electr time power shortag hit citi provinc across countri hydroelectricpow gener hurt high coal cost net incom jump bn yuan m £m compar bn yuan sale surg bn yuan bn yuan year earlier figur top analyst expect even though rate growth slow analyst forecast like declin year rate expans closer yangtz electr expand output meet demand driven china boom economi govern delay build number power plant effort rein growth amid concern economi may overheat lead energi crunch demand outstrip suppli earlier month work halt underground power station suppli unit three gorg dam well power station sister xiluodu dam environment worri total largescal project halt across countri similar reason three gorg dam project lead half million peopl reloc drawn critic environment group oversea human right activist sister project xiluodu dam built jinshajiang river golden sand upper reach yangtz know
632,180,arsenal  may seek full share listing  arsenal vice-chairman david dein has said the club may consider seeking a full listing for its shares on the london stock exchange.  speaking at the soccerex football business forum in dubai  he said a full listing was  one of the options  for funding after the club moves to its new stadium. the club - which is currently listed on the smaller ofex share exchange - is due to move into its new 60 000-seater emirates stadium at ashburton grove for the start of the 2006/07 season. mr dein also warned the current level of tv coverage of the premiership may be reaching saturation level  with signs that match attendances have been dropping off in the first few months of this season.  when arsenal moves to its new stadium it will see its proportion of turnover from media earnings drop from 52% this season to 34% in two years  time. the club is hoping to increase matchday earnings from 29% to 40% of turnover  and has not ruled out other money-earning means  including a full share listing.  when the new stadium opens we will go through a thorough financial review   mr dein said.   listing would be one option  but we are flexible and no decisions have been made on that issue yet.  we want to be in the best financial health - maybe clubs can do it (listing)  manchester united have been a success.   mr dein said that  although television money and coverage had driven the english game forward in the past 10 years  he feared there might now be too many games being shown. since the formation of the premier league in season 1992/93  premiership clubs have seen their income from television soar.  television has been the driving force over the past 10 years... but we must constantly improve if we want to remain as the world s leading league competition.  we must monitor the quality of the product and ensure attendances do not decline  and we must balance that with the quantity of exposure on tv too.  i think we have practically reached saturation point... sometimes i think less is more.   the club is funding its move to ashburton grove through a number of sources  including debt from banks  from money it already has and will receive in coming years from sponsors  and from the sale of surplus property  including its highbury stadium. it is also looking to create new revenue streams from overseas markets  including asia.  we have two executives travelling round japan and china at the moment building relationships with organisations and clubs  and we know our supporters clubs are growing there too  as they are around the world.  we have got a very good product  so it is very important we go and look at these markets  and make sure we are on the case.,arsen may seek full share list arsen vicechairman david dein say club may consid seek full list share london stock exchang speak soccerex footbal busi forum dubai say full list one option fund club move new stadium club current list small ofex share exchang due move new seater emir stadium ashburton grove start season mr dein also warn current level tv coverag premiership may reach satur level sign match attend drop first month season arsen move new stadium see proport turnov medium earn drop season two year time club hope increas matchday earn turnov rule moneyearn mean includ full share list new stadium open go thorough financi review mr dein say list would one option flexibl decis make issu yet want best financi health mayb club list manchest unit success mr dein say although televis money coverag driven english game forward past year fear might mani game show sinc format premier leagu season premiership club see incom televis soar televis drive forc past year must constantli improv want remain world lead leagu competit must monitor qualiti product ensur attend declin must balanc quantiti exposur tv think practic reach satur point sometim think less club fund move ashburton grove number sourc includ debt bank money alreadi receiv come year sponsor sale surplu properti includ highburi stadium also look creat new revenu stream oversea market includ asia two execut travel round japan china moment build relationship organis club know support club grow around world get good product import go look market make sure case

634,150,the future in your pocket if you are a geek or gadget fan  the next 12 months look like they are going to be a lot of fun.  the relentless pace of development in the hi-tech world and rampant competition in many of its sectors  particularly among mobile phone firms  all suggests that 2005 is going to be a very good year. to begin with  2005 will be the year that third-generation (3g) mobile phones become inescapable. the 3 network launched in 2003  vodafone launched its consumer service in november  orange followed in early december and t-mobile and o2 are due to launch in 2005. the main result of these launches will likely be a slew of good deals for consumers as operators try to poach new customers from rivals and convince existing users to trade up.  already the extra capacity in 3g networks lets 3 offer good deals on voice calls at rates that will probably have to be matched by the other operators. but the shift in technology and low cost of voice calls means that operators lose a significant chunk of their revenue.  show me an operator that believes their voice business can sustain them  and i ll write their obituary  said niel ransom  chief technology officer at alcatel.  instead operators are likely to push all other things that 3g phones can do such as video messaging and other multimedia capabilities. already camera phones look set to challenge digital cameras and are likely to win more fans as multi-megapixel devices go on sale. but 3g will not have everything its own way. it will face competition from emerging technologies such as wimax. this wireless technology can boost data transmission speeds up to 75 megabits per second and works over distances of up to 30 miles. kent is likely to be the site of the uk s first wimax network which is due to go live in 2005 and it could be the way that rural areas get high-speed net access. analyst firm telecom view predicts that wimax will steal a lot of market share from 3g and will be a clear winner. bob larribeau  principal analyst at telecom view  said the better return on investment offered by technologies such as wimax could dent the possible returns of 3g networks. and the growing ubiquity of wi-fi must not be forgotten either. the technology is popping up in more places than ever and its wider use is only held back by the price differences across countries and suppliers.  moves to unite mobile and fixed phones look set to get more emphasis in 2005 too.  for a start  bt looks set to roll out its bluephone project during the next 12 months. the service revolves around a hybrid device that uses the mobile networks when you are out and about but switches back to the fixed line when you are at home. fixed line phones will also start to get much more serious competition from a technology that has the formidable name of voice over ip (voip). voip routes calls via the net instead of the fixed line phone network. anyone with a broadband connection  which is now more than 50% of the uk s net using population  can use voip and could slash their monthly phone bills if they used it. telecommunications regulator ofcom has declared 056 to be the area code for voip calls and 2005 is likely to see a lot more consumer-focused voip call services starting up. home broadband services will also start to increase in speed as dwindling numbers of new users signing force the pace of competition. if 2004 has been the year of the portable music player  they 2005 looks like it will be the year of the portable media player. motorola has just announced a deal with apple to produce a phone that works with the itunes service and other hybrid gadgets that sport a big memory and lots of other functions will become commonplace. the pace of advancement in storage media will continue mean that the cost per megabyte of memory will plummet. some of those devices will sport huge hard drives letting you store more data than you ever wanted or knew you had. convergence could mean that single-function devices start to dwindle in number. instead every gadget will be able to do almost anything and communicate almost any way you want. the only downside is that consumers will face a series of tough choices as they are confronted by a bewildering array of gadgets each with an enormous numbers of features and vast data holding capacities. but that is the kind of problem most gadget fans can live with.,futur pocket geek gadget fan next month look like go lot fun relentless pace develop hitech world rampant competit mani sector particularli among mobil phone firm suggest go

636,365,bangkok film festival battles on organisers of the third bangkok international film festival have been determined to carry on with this year s event despite the ravages of the asian tsunami disaster.  the festivities have been scaled down  red carpets have been mothballed and profits from ticket sales are being donated to the tsunami relief fund. apart from this  however  the festival has continued as originally planned.  when the disaster happened  we naturally asked ourselves if we should cancel   said the festival s executive director  craig prater.  the decision was made that we would continue  but that the focus would change.   our premieres became fundraisers  the opening night was visibly toned down and 10% of every ticket sold goes to the disaster fund   he continued.  but we feel like we ve turned a page. we ve acknowledged our position  and now it s business as usual.   mr prater s sentiments were echoed by christine rush  director of the festival s sister event  the bangkok film market.  we have been careful to be respectful of the thai nation s recovery from this terrible disaster   she said.   however  the nation s recovery very much depends upon it continuing its economic life.  we are encouraging attendees to keep the victims in mind and aggressively support the aid organisations helping out   she added. given the conspicuously low audience figures  that support may be more symbolic than significant. however  poor ticket sales have less to do with any fallout from the disaster and more to do with administrative and promotional difficulties.  the eclectic programme contains a wide range of titles  including such oscar hopefuls as ray charles biopic ray and mike leigh s abortion drama vera drake. that said  the absence of thai subtitles on most film prints might have proved offputting to local cinemagoers.  on a more positive note  the celebrity guests attending the event have generated huge media interest in this busy capital city. problems securing air transport  the clash with last sunday s golden globes ceremony in los angeles and other factors have forced some big names to cancel.  but the festival has still attracted such hollywood directors as oliver stone and joel schumacher  alongside such screen stars as michael douglas  jeremy irons and jean-claude van damme. irons  whose film being julia is in competition for the festival s golden kinnaree awards  said he had wondered whether he should attend after december s catastrophe.  i questioned whether i should come when such a tragedy had happened   the british actor said.  i thought it might be in rather bad taste. but then i spoke to the organisers and i was encouraged to let life go on.  now i ve come here i m very glad. what impresses me about thai culture is they get over these things far quicker than we do in the west   he continued.  basically i was invited here by thailand. if they still want you to come  you should.   now in its third year  bangkok is a relatively recent addition to the hectic film festival calendar. and while it has yet to attain the stature of more established events held in hong kong  tokyo and pusan in south korea  mr prater predicts it will soon become their equal.  it s grown awfully fast in three years - maybe too fast   he concedes.  we ve had some bumps in the road  but that s only because the festival is still a baby.  i have no doubt in my mind that in five years  this will be the top asian film festival in the world.  the golden kinnarees will be awarded on friday. the festival itself runs until 24 january.,bangkok film festiv battl organis third bangkok intern film festiv determin carri year event despit ravag asian tsunami disast festiv scale red carpet mothbal profit ticket sale donat tsunami relief fund apart howev festiv continu origin plan disast happen natur ask cancel say festiv execut director craig prater decis make would continu focu would chang premier becam fundrais open night visibl tone everi ticket sell goe disast fund continu feel like turn page acknowledg posit busi usual mr prater sentiment echo christin rush director festiv sister event bangkok film market care respect thai nation recoveri terribl disast say howev nation recoveri much depend upon continu econom life encourag attende keep victim mind aggress support aid organis help ad give conspicu low audienc figur support may symbol signific howev poor ticket sale less fallout disast administr promot difficulti eclect programm contain wide rang titl includ oscar hope ray charl biopic ray mike leigh abort drama vera drake say absenc thai subtitl film print might prove offput local cinemago posit note celebr guest attend event gener huge medium interest busi capit citi problem secur air transport clash last sunday golden globe ceremoni lo angel factor forc big name cancel festiv still attract hollywood director oliv stone joel schumach alongsid screen star michael dougla jeremi iron jeanclaud van damm iron whose film julia competit festiv golden kinnare award say wonder whether attend decemb catastroph question whether come tragedi happen british actor say thought might rather bad tast spoke organis encourag let life go come glad impress thai cultur get thing far quicker west continu basic invit thailand still want come third year bangkok rel recent addit hectic film festiv calendar yet attain statur establish event held hong kong tokyo pusan south korea mr prater predict soon becom equal grown aw fast three year mayb fast conced bump road festiv still babi doubt mind five year top asian film festiv world golden kinnare award friday festiv run januari
637,1852,observers to monitor uk election ministers will invite international observers to check the forthcoming uk general election is fairly run.  the move comes amid claims the poll could be marred by electoral fraud. a report by two mps committees called on thursday for urgent changes to the electoral registration system to combat vote rigging and boost turnout. but in a written response to labour mp gordon prentice  the government said it would normally invite observers to any uk election.  junior constitutional affairs minister christopher leslie said:  i fully expect us to repeat our previous practice of doing so once the date for the next general election is announced.  the government has looked at ways of boosting voter turnout  which fell to 59% in the last general election in 2001.  but trial all-postal ballots in four english regions last summer were hit by delays and some fraud allegations. liberal democrat peer lord greaves called last week for international observers at the general election - saying otherwise there could be months of court challenges  on a scale not seen since the 19th century . thursday s report was drawn up by two committees scrutinising the work of the office of the deputy prime minister (odpm) and the department for constitutional affairs (dca). it said that  with the growth of postal voting  there was a strong case to tighten up fraud protection by requiring voters to register individually  rather than by household. it also said about three million people eligible to vote are not registered to do so.  figures for the 2001 general election suggest 29% of people aged between 18 and 24  and 19% of black voters were not on the electoral roll. young people in shared accommodation are thought to miss out because no one acts as head of the household to fill in the form. odpm committee chairman andrew bennett said individual voter registration  as opposed to registration by household  should be quickly introduced as it could  dramatically reduce the chances of fraud . but his counterpart on the dca committee  alan beith  said it should be delayed  until measures likely to increase registration have been put in place and proved effective.  shadow constitutional affairs secretary oliver heald accused the government of  dragging its feet  over  this badly needed measure .  it is vital that we move ahead with the northern ireland system of individual electoral registration to safeguard the integrity of the britain s electoral system   he said.  the report said individual registration should be treated carefully as 12% of voters disappeared from the electoral roll in northern ireland when it was introduced in 2002. the report said the government should consider fines for unregistered voters  but accepted many experts said it would be an expensive system that would be hard to enforce. it said incentives to register  such as £20 council tax rebate  were likely to be seen as  gimmicks  and risked undermining the integrity of the system  mps said. instead they called for  imaginative campaigns  to boost interest.,observ monitor uk elect minist invit intern observ check forthcom uk gener elect fairli run move come amid claim poll could mar elector fraud report two mp committe call thursday urgent chang elector registr system combat vote rig boost turnout write respons labour mp gordon prentic govern say would normal invit observ uk elect junior constitut affair minist christoph lesli say fulli expect u repeat previou practic date next gener elect announc govern look way boost voter turnout fell last gener elect trial allpost ballot four english region last summer hit delay fraud alleg liber democrat peer lord greav call last week intern observ gener elect say otherwis could month court challeng scale see sinc th centuri thursday report drawn two committe scrutinis work offic deputi prime minist odpm depart constitut affair dca say growth postal vote strong case tighten fraud protect requir voter regist individu rather household also say three million peopl elig vote regist figur gener elect suggest peopl age black voter elector roll young peopl share accommod thought miss one act head household fill form odpm committe chairman andrew bennett say individu voter registr oppos registr household quickli introduc could dramat reduc chanc fraud counterpart dca committe alan beith say delay measur like increas registr put place prove effect shadow constitut affair secretari oliv heald accus govern drag foot badli need measur vital move ahead northern ireland system individu elector registr safeguard integr britain elector system say report say individu registr treat care voter disappear elector roll northern ireland introduc report say govern consid fine unregist voter accept mani expert say would expens system would hard enforc say incent regist £ council tax rebat like see gimmick risk undermin integr system mp say instead call imagin campaign boost interest
638,1937,more power to the people says hp the digital revolution is focused on letting people tell and share their own stories  according to carly fiorina  chief of technology giant hewlett packard.  the job of firms such as hp now  she said in a speech at the consumer electronics show (ces)  was to ensure digital and physical worlds fully converged. she said the goal for 2005 was to make people the centre of technology. ces showcases 50 000 new gadgets that will be hitting the shelves in 2005. the tech-fest  the largest of its kind in the world  runs from 6 to 9 january.  the digital revolution is about the democratisation of technology and the experiences it makes possible   she told delegates.  revolution has always been about giving power to the people.  she added:  the real story of the digital revolution is not just new products  but the millions of experiences made possible and stories that millions can tell.  part of giving people more control has been about the freeing up of content  such as images  video and music. crucial to this has been the effort to make devices that speak to each other better so that content can be more easily transferred from one device  such as a digital camera  to others  such as portable media players. a lot of work still needs to be done  however  to sort out compatibility issues and standards within the technology industry so that gadgets just work seamlessly  she said.  ms fiorina s talk also touted the way technology is being designed to focus on lifestyle  fashion and personalisation  something she sees as key to what people want.  special guest  singer gwen stefani  joined her on-stage to promote her own range of hp digital cameras which ms stefani has helped design and which are heavily influenced by japanese youth culture. the digital cameras  which are due to go on sale in the us by the summer  are based on the hp 607 model. the emphasis on personalisation and lifestyle is a big theme at this year s ces  with tiny  wearable mp3 players at every turn and rainbow hues giving colour to everything. ms fiorina also announced that hp was working with nokia to launch a visual radio service for mobiles  which would launch in europe early this year. the service will let people listen to radio on their mobiles and download relevant content  like a track s ringtone  simultaneously. the service is designed to make mobile radio more interactive.  among the other new products she showcased was the digital media hub  a big upgrade to hp s digital entertainment centre. coming out in the autumn in the us  the box is a networked  high-definition tv  cable set-top box  digital video recorder and dvd recorder. it has a removable hard drive cartridge  memory card slots  and light scribe labelling software which lets people design and print customised dvd labels and covers. it is designed to contain all a household s digital media  such as pre-recorded tv shows  pictures  videos and music so it can all be managed in one place. the hub reflects the increasing move to re-box the pc so that it can work as part of other key centres of entertainment. research suggests that about 258 million images are saved and shared every day  equating to 94 billion a year. eighty per cent of those remain on cameras. media hubs are designed to encourage people to organise them on one box. ms fiorina was one of several keynote speakers  who also included microsoft chief bill gates  to set out what major technology companies think people will be doing with technologies and gadgets in the next 12 months. in a separate announcement during the keynote speech  ms fiorina said that hp would be partnering mtv to replace this year s mtv asia music award. mtv s asia aid will be held in bangkok on 3 february  and is aimed at helping to raise money for the asian tsunami disaster.,power peopl say hp digit revolut focus let peopl tell share stori accord carli fiorina chief technolog

639,158,gm  ford cut output as sales fall us car firms general motors (gm) and ford have been forced to cut production in the face of falling car sales.  us sales at gm sank 12.7% in february compared to a year ago while ford sales dropped 3% as foreign rivals took a bigger share of the market. meanwhile  asian carmakers fared well - toyota sales jumped 11% while rival nissan notched up a 10% increase. overall. sales across the industry also fell to 1.25 million vehicles from 1.27 million a year earlier.  gm and ford blamed high fuel prices for low sales of big trucks and gas-guzzling sports utility vehicles (suvs) - the vehicles that provide the biggest profits.  gm added that us truck sales fell 9% in february while car business tumbled 17%  however it did acknowledge that some new products - such as the pontiac g6 and chevrolet cobalt - had put in solid performances.  the calendar year is starting off slower than expected  both for gm and the industry   said mark laneve  gm s vice president for north american sales  service and marketing. the slump in sales prompted the group to cut production in north america by 3% - it has already reduced output by around 9% in the face of growing stockpiles. meanwhile  ford which posted its ninth consecutive drop in monthly us sales  said it was cutting first-quarter north american production by another 10 000 vehicles  or 1.2%. chrysler  the us unit of germany s daimlerchrysler  was the only detroit based automaker to boast an increase in market share during the month - with sales rising 8%.  but america s loss was its foreign rivals  gain as they continued to nibble away at the us market. while japan s top car maker toyota and nissan saw sales accelerate  even the smaller suzuki motor corp snapped up a more business with sales improving 17.6% on a year ago. in 2003  the firm launched an ambitious plan to triple us sales by 2007 as it seeks to become a bigger player in the asian assault on the us market. korea s hyundai was another big gainer  turning in a 19% surge in february sales. toyota put its rise in sales down to strong results for its redesigned avalon sedan and a 120% surge in sales of its gas-electric prius hybrid mid-size sedan as petrol-price conscious consumers looked to vehicles that were cheaper to run.  as gas prices continue their upward march  fuel efficiency catches the public eye   jim press  vice president and chief operating officer of toyota s us sales arm  said in a statement.,gm ford cut output sale fall u car firm gener motor gm ford forc cut product face fall car sale u sale gm sank februari compar year ago ford sale drop foreign rival take big share market meanwhil asian carmak fare well toyota sale jump rival nissan notch increas overal sale across industri also fell million vehicl million year earlier gm ford blame high fuel price low sale big truck gasguzzl sport util vehicl suv vehicl provid big profit gm ad u truck sale fell februari car busi tumbl howev acknowledg new product pontiac g chevrolet cobalt put solid perform calendar year start slow expect gm industri say mark lanev gm vice presid north american sale servic market slump sale prompt group cut product north america alreadi reduc output around face grow stockpil meanwhil ford post ninth consecut drop monthli u sale say cut firstquart north american product anoth vehicl chrysler u unit germani daimlerchrysl detroit base automak boast increas market share month sale rise america loss foreign rival gain continu nibbl away u market japan top car maker toyota nissan saw sale acceler even small suzuki motor corp snap busi sale improv year ago firm launch ambiti plan tripl u sale seek becom big player asian assault u market korea hyundai anoth big gainer turn surg februari sale toyota put rise sale strong result redesign avalon sedan surg sale gaselectr priu hybrid midsiz sedan petrolpric consciou consum look vehicl cheaper run ga price continu upward march fuel effici catch public eye jim press vice presid chief oper offic toyota u sale arm say statement

641,2210,time to get tough on friendlies  for an international manager  a friendly provides an important opportunity to work with your players.  the only problem is that the game itself can often be a farce. some people have been saying it would be better to get the players together for the week  and do away with the 90 minutes at the end.  i would say it s 50-50 whether you should have these games or not  and if you look at it that way you would probably say you re better not doing so. it would certainly keep club managers happy  as it would reduce the risk of players returning to domestic duty injured. but international bosses will tell you that scrapping friendlies is counterproductive because the only way for a team to get better is by playing. the more you play together  the easier it is when it comes to the crunch in games like world cup quarter-finals against brazil. often in friendlies  though  a manager will play his strongest side for the first 45 minutes and then send out an entirely different one in the second half. and it s very difficult for any player to come on as substitute in a side with a few changes  let alone a whole team s worth. the debate will rage on  and i m not sure there is a satisfactory solution. one manager who has got it right this week is walter smith. the new scotland manager has decided to have a training camp instead of a friendly for his first international week since replacing berti vogts. it is the sort of move you would expect from walter  who is a canny manager.  the players have had such a hard time recently that he is better off getting them together in a relaxed atmosphere and trying to generate some team spirit before the next world cup qualifiers. if he had sent them out on wednesday and they had been badly beaten  it would have done them no good whatsoever. john toshack has his first game in charge of wales  and it will be important for him to get a decent result against hungary. he will have his own ideas on individuals and how to play and will probably look more at the performance  but the public wants results. it s extremely difficult to get the balance for friendlies. if you win  people forget them  but if you lose it becomes a stat that can be used against you. england s game against holland is a good example. it looks like a good opportunity to try out players like middlesbrough winger stewart downing or crystal palace striker andy johnson. but you have got to remember sven-goran eriksson s side were given a lesson by spain in the last game they played.  the injury problems in defence should at least give the likes of wes brown and jamie carragher a chance to impress. for the club managers  it will simply be a case of waiting at home with fingers crossed.,time get tough friendli intern manag friendli provid import opportun work player problem game often farc peopl say would well get player togeth week away minut end would say whether game look way would probabl say well would certainli keep club manag happi would reduc risk player return domest duti injur intern bos tell scrap friendli counterproduct way team get well play play togeth easy come crunch game like world cup quarterfin brazil often friendli though manag play strong side first minut send entir differ one second half difficult player come substitut side chang let alon whole team worth debat rage sure satisfactori solut one manag get right week walter smith new scotland manag decid train camp instead friendli first intern week sinc replac berti vogt sort move would expect walter canni manag player hard time recent well get togeth relax atmospher tri gener team spirit next world cup qualifi sent wednesday badli beaten would do good whatsoev john toshack first game charg wale import get decent result hungari idea individu play probabl look perform public want result extrem difficult get balanc friendli win peopl forget lose becom stat use england game holland good exampl look like good opportun tri player like middlesbrough winger stewart down crystal palac striker andi johnson get rememb svengoran eriksson side give lesson spain last game play injuri problem defenc least give like we brown jami carragh chanc impress club manag simpli case wait home finger cross
642,295,china net cafe culture crackdown chinese authorities closed 12 575 net cafes in the closing months of 2004  the country s government said.  according to the official news agency most of the net cafes were closed down because they were operating illegally. chinese net cafes operate under a set of strict guidelines and many of those most recently closed broke rules that limit how close they can be to schools. the move is the latest in a series of steps the chinese government has taken to crack down on what it considers to be immoral net use.  the official xinhua news agency said the crackdown was carried out to create a  safer environment for young people in china . rules introduced in 2002 demand that net cafes be at least 200 metres away from middle and elementary schools. the hours that children can use net cafes are also tightly regulated. china has long been worried that net cafes are an unhealthy influence on young people. the 12 575 cafes were shut in the three months from october to december. china also tries to dictate the types of computer games people can play to limit the amount of violence people are exposed to.  net cafes are hugely popular in china because the relatively high cost of computer hardware means that few people have pcs in their homes. this is not the first time that the chinese government has moved against net cafes that are not operating within its strict guidelines. all the 100 000 or so net cafes in the country are required to use software that controls what websites users can see. logs of sites people visit are also kept. laws on net cafe opening hours and who can use them were introduced in 2002 following a fire at one cafe that killed 25 people. during the crackdown following the blaze authorities moved to clean up net cafes and demanded that all of them get permits to operate. in august 2004 chinese authorities shut down 700 websites and arrested 224 people in a crackdown on net porn. at the same time it introduced new controls to block overseas sex sites. the reporters without borders group said in a report that chinese government technologies for e-mail interception and net censorship are among the most highly developed in the world.,china net cafe cultur crackdown chine author close net cafe close month countri govern say accord offici news agenc net cafe close oper illeg chine net cafe oper set strict guidelin mani recent close broke rule limit close school move late seri step chine govern take crack consid immor net use offici xinhua news agenc say crackdown carri creat safer environ young peopl china rule introduc demand net cafe least metr away middl elementari school hour child use net cafe also tightli regul china long worri net cafe unhealthi influenc young peopl cafe shut three month octob decemb china also tri dictat type comput game peopl play limit amount violenc peopl expo net cafe huge popular china rel high cost comput hardwar mean peopl pc home first time chine govern move net cafe oper within strict guidelin net cafe countri requir use softwar control websit user see log site peopl visit also kept law net cafe open hour use introduc follow fire one cafe kill peopl crackdown follow blaze author move clean net cafe demand get permit oper august chine author shut websit arrest peopl crackdown net porn time introduc new control block oversea sex site report without border group say report chine govern technolog email intercept net censorship among highli develop world
643,1241,gadget growth fuels eco concerns technology firms and gadget lovers are being urged to think more about the environment when buying and disposing of the latest hi-tech products.  at the consumer electronics show in las vegas earlier this month  several hi-tech firms were recognised for their strategies to help the environment. ebay also announced the rethink project bringing together intel  apple  and ibm among others to promote recycling. the us consumer electronics market is set to grow by over 11% in 2005. but more awareness is needed about how and where old gadgets can be recycled as well as how to be more energy efficient  said the us environmental protection agency (epa). of particular growing concern is how much energy it takes to recharge portable devices  one of the fastest growing markets in technology. the consumer electronics association (cea) has predicted that shipments of consumer technologies in 2005 will reach more than $125.73 billion (nearly £68 billion).  ebay s initiative pulls together major technology firms  environment groups  government agencies and ebay users to give information about what to do with old computers and where to send them. the online auction house thinks that its already-established community of loyal users could be influential.  we really became aware of the e-waste issue and we saw that our 125 million users can be a powerful force for good   ebay s david stern told the bbc news website.   we saw the opportunity to meet the additional demand we have on the site for used computers and saw the opportunity too to good some good for the environment.  but it is not just computers that cause a problem for the environment. teenagers get a new mobile every 11 months  adults every 18 months and a 15 million handsets are replaced in total each year. yet  only 15% are actually recycled. this year  a predicted two billion people worldwide will own a mobile  according to a deloitte report. schemes in the us  like ripmobile  could help in targeting younger generations with recycling messages. the initiative  which was also launched at ces  rewards 10 to 28-year-olds for returning unused phones.  this system allows for the transformation of a drawer full of unused mobile phones into anything from music to clothes to electronics or games   said seth heine from ripmobile.  one group of students collected 1 000 mobiles for recycling in just three months. mr heine told the bbc news website that what was important was to raise awareness amongst the young so that recycling becomes  learned behaviour . europe is undoubtedly more advanced than the us in terms of recycling awareness and robust  end of life  programmes  although there is a tide change happening in the rest of the world too. intel showcased some its motherboards and chips at ces which are entirely lead free.   there is more and more awareness on the consumer side  but the whole industry is moving towards being lead free   intel s allen wilson told the bbc news website.  there is still low-level awareness right now  but it is on the rise - the highest level of awareness is in europe.  a european union (eu) directive  weee (waste electronic and electrical equipment)  comes into effect in august. it puts the responsibility on electrical manufacturers to recycle items that are returned to them. but developments are also being made to design better technologies which are more energy efficient and which do not contain harmful substances. elements like chromium  lead  and cadmium - common in consumer electronics goods - will be prohibited in all products in the eu by 2006.  but it is not just about recycling either. the predicted huge growth in the gadget market means the amount of energy used to power them up is on the rise too. the biggest culprit  according to the epa  is the innocuous power adaptor  nicknamed  energy vampires . they provide vital juice for billions of mobile phones  pdas (personal digital assistants)  digital cameras  camcorders  and digital music players.  although there is a focus on developing efficient and improved circuits in the devices themselves  the technologies inside rechargers are still outdated and so eat up more energy than is needed to power a gadget. on 1 january  new efficiency standards for external power supplies came into effect as part of the european commission code of conduct. but at ces  the epa also unveiled new guidelines for its latest energy star initiative which targets external power adapters. these map out the framework for developing better adaptors that can be labelled with an energy star logo  meaning they are about 35% more efficient. the initiative is a global effort and more manufacturers  adaptors are being brought on board. most are made in china. about two billion are shipped global every year  and about three billion are in use in the us alone. the epa is already working with several companies which make more than 22% of power supplies on the market.  we are increasingly finding companies that not only want to provide neat  hi-tech devices  but also bundle with it a hi-tech  efficient power supply   the epa s andrew fanara said. initiatives like this are critical; if power adaptors continue to be made and used as they are now  consumer electronics and other small appliances will be responsible for more than 40% of electricity used in us homes  said the epa.,gadget growth fuel eco concern technolog firm gadget lover urg think environ buy dispos late hitech product consum electron show la vega earlier

647,1952,christmas sales worst since 1981 uk retail sales fell in december  failing to meet expectations and making it by some counts the worst christmas since 1981.  retail sales dropped by 1% on the month in december  after a 0.6% rise in november  the office for national statistics (ons) said. the ons revised the annual 2004 rate of growth down from the 5.9% estimated in november to 3.2%. a number of retailers have already reported poor figures for december. clothing retailers and non-specialist stores were the worst hit with only internet retailers showing any significant growth  according to the ons.  the last time retailers endured a tougher christmas was 23 years previously  when sales plunged 1.7%.  the ons echoed an earlier caution from bank of england governor mervyn king not to read too much into the poor december figures. some analysts put a positive gloss on the figures  pointing out that the non-seasonally-adjusted figures showed a performance comparable with 2003. the november-december jump last year was roughly comparable with recent averages  although some way below the serious booms seen in the 1990s. and figures for retail volume outperformed measures of actual spending  an indication that consumers are looking for bargains  and retailers are cutting their prices.  however  reports from some high street retailers highlight the weakness of the sector. morrisons  woolworths  house of fraser  marks & spencer and big food all said that the festive period was disappointing.  and a british retail consortium survey found that christmas 2004 was the worst for 10 years. yet  other retailers - including hmv  monsoon  jessops  body shop and tesco - reported that festive sales were well up on last year. investec chief economist philip shaw said he did not expect the poor retail figures to have any immediate effect on interest rates.  the retail sales figures are very weak  but as bank of england governor mervyn king indicated last night  you don t really get an accurate impression of christmas trading until about easter   said mr shaw.  our view is the bank of england will keep its powder dry and wait to see the big picture.,christma sale bad sinc uk retail sale fell decemb fail meet expect make count bad christma sinc retail sale drop month decemb rise novemb offic nation statist on say on revis annual rate growth estim novemb number retail alreadi report poor figur decemb cloth retail nonspecialist store bad hit internet retail show signific growth accord on last time retail endur tougher christma year previous sale plung on echo earlier caution bank england governor mervyn king read much poor decemb figur analyst put posit gloss figur point nonseasonallyadjust figur show perform compar novemberdecemb jump last year roughli compar recent averag although way seriou boom see s figur retail volum outperform measur actual spend indic consum look bargain retail cut price howev report high street retail highlight weak sector morrison woolworth hous fraser mark spencer big food say festiv period disappoint british retail consortium survey found christma bad year yet retail includ hmv monsoon jessop bodi shop tesco report festiv sale well last year investec chief economist philip shaw say expect poor retail figur immedi effect interest rate retail sale figur weak bank england governor mervyn king indic last night realli get accur impress christma trade easter say mr shaw view bank england keep powder dri wait see big pictur

650,1795,robinson ready for difficult task england coach andy robinson faces the first major test of his tenure as he tries to get back to winning ways after the six nations defeat by wales.  robinson is likely to make changes in the back row and centre after the 11-9 loss as he contemplates sunday s set-to with france at twickenham. lewis moody and martin corry could both return after missing the game with hamstring and shoulder problems. and the midfield pairing of mathew tait and jamie noon is also under threat. olly barkley immediately allowed england to generate better field position with his kicking game after replacing debutant tait just before the hour. the bath fly-half-cum-centre is likely to start against france  with either tait or noon dropping out.  tait  given little opportunity to shine in attack  received praise from robinson afterwards  even if the coach admitted cardiff was an  unforgiving place  for the teenage prodigy. robinson now has a tricky decision over whether to withdraw from the firing line  after just one outing  a player he regards as central to england s future. tait himself  at least outwardly  appeared unaffected by the punishing treatment dished out to him by gavin henson in particular.  i want more of that definitely   he said.  hopefully i can train hard this week and get selected for next week but we ll have to look at the video and wait and see.  we were playing on our own 22 for a lot of the first half so it was quite difficult. i thought we defended reasonably well but we ve just got to pick it up for france.   his newcastle team-mate noon hardly covered himself in glory in his first major test. he missed a tackle on michael owen in the build-up to wales  try  conceded a penalty at the breakdown  was turned over in another tackle and fumbled gavin henson s cross-kick into touch  all inside the first quarter. his contribution improved in the second half  but england clearly need more of a playmaker in the inside centre role. up front  the line-out remains fallible  despite a superb performance from chris jones  whose athleticism came to the fore after stepping into the side for moody. it is more likely the leicester flanker will return on the open side for the more physical challenge posed by the french forwards  with andy hazell likely to make way. lock ben kay also justified his recall with an impressive all-round display on his return to the side  but elsewhere england positives were thin on the ground.,robinson readi difficult task england coach andi robinson face first major test tenur tri get back win way six nation defeat wale robinson like make chang back row centr loss contempl sunday setto franc twickenham lewi moodi martin corri could return miss game hamstr shoulder problem midfield pair mathew tait jami noon also threat olli barkley immedi allow england gener well field posit kick game replac debut tait hour bath flyhalfcumcentr like start franc either tait noon drop tait give littl opportun shine attack receiv prais robinson afterward even coach admit cardiff unforgiv place teenag prodigi robinson tricki decis whether withdraw fire line one out player regard central england futur tait least outwardli appear unaffect punish treatment dish gavin henson particular want definit say hope train hard week get select next week look video wait see play lot first half quit difficult thought defend reason well get pick franc newcastl teammat noon hardli cover glori first major test miss tackl michael owen buildup wale tri conced penalti breakdown turn anoth tackl fumbl gavin henson crosskick touch insid first quarter contribut improv second half england clearli need playmak insid centr role front lineout remain fallibl despit superb perform chri jone whose athletic come fore step side moodi like leicest flanker return open side physic challeng pose french forward andi hazel like make way lock ben kay also justifi recal impress allround display return side elsewher england posit thin ground
651,1478,giving financial gifts to children your child or grandchild may want the latest toy this christmas  but how about giving them a present that will help their financial future   gifts of the financial variety might have a longer lasting impact. it may encourage children to save or start a fund which could count towards university costs  for example.  the government is trying to encourage saving at an early age  through its new child trust fund. the first vouchers  worth £250 or £500 for low-income families  will be distributed from january. all children born after 1st september 2002 will be eligible. parents will need to decide which financial institution will manage this gift in time for the start of the scheme in april 2005.  parents and relatives will be able to top up the fund with up to £1 200 a year  which will grow free of income and capital gains tax. as the child trust fund will not be in force in time for christmas  relatives could invest their gifts in a higher rate children s deposit account  and use this as a feeder fund.  there are accounts designed to start children off in the savings habit and they often pay a higher rate of interest. some of the best instant-access accounts currently available include the ladybird account from the saffron walden building society  paying 5.35% for a minimum balance of £1 and the alliance & leicester firstsaver which pays 5.25%  also starting at £1.  interest earned by children is subject to income tax. however  children  like adults  have a personal income tax allowance (£4 745 for the current tax year).  if the account holds money gifted by friends and relatives - but not parents - any interest earned from the savings account may be set against the allowance. as long as the total amount of interest falls within the allowance  then no tax will be payable. when the account is opened a form  r85   available from the bank or building society  should be completed. this confirms that the account holder is a non-taxpayer and allows interest to be received without the deduction of income tax.  the tax rules are different for parents who save on behalf of a child. only £100 of interest (per parent) can be tax-free. where interest exceeds this level  the whole of the interest will be taxed on the parent. this is to prevent parents from holding their own cash savings in their children s names and taking advantage of the tax allowances. where both parents and other relatives are saving on behalf of a child  consideration should be given to opening separate accounts - one for parents  gifts and one for gifts from other relatives. therefore  it may be preferable for parents to contribute to the child trust fund which is tax free  with any gifts from relatives that take the total above the annual £1 200 limit being directed to a deposit account.  another favourite solution is premium bonds. with the promise of riches far greater than a mere deposit account  they make great presents. the parent or guardian will be responsible for the bonds and will receive notification of the purchase. any prizes will be sent to the parent or child s guardian. the minimum for each purchase is £100 and bonds are sold in multiples of £10.  there are gift opportunities beyond cash accounts and these should not be ignored.  over the longer term  stock market funds have outperformed other types of investment  although in the shorter term they can be volatile. one of the benefits of investing for children is that investment is generally for the longer term - more than ten years - which helps to reduce the risks associated with investing in shares. one way to spread the risk is to invest in the stock market through a unit or investment trust. these are pooled investment funds which give access to a wide range of shares. these funds may be actively managed  where a fund manager picks individual stocks based on a view of their future potential  or passive  where a manager invests in all the shares that comprise a stock market index  for example  the ftse 100. exchange traded funds offer an alternative way to track a stock market. these are single shares that give the return of an underlying index (so are really another form of tracker). the difference is that the charges are quite low. the only drawback with all financial gifts is that the children gain an absolute right to the money at age 18  and parents will have no control over how it is spent. for larger gifts it may be worthwhile taking professional advice on the establishment of a suitable trust that will allow ongoing control over the capital and income.,give financi gift child child grandchild may want late toy christma give present help financi futur gift financi varieti might longer last impact may encourag child save start fund could count toward univers cost exampl govern tri encourag save earli age new child trust fund first voucher worth £ £ lowincom famili distribut januari child born st septemb elig parent need decid financi institut manag gift time start scheme april parent rel abl top fund £ year grow free incom capit gain tax child trust fund forc time christma rel could invest gift high rate child deposit account use feeder fund account design start child save habit often pay high rate interest best instantaccess account current avail includ ladybird account saffron walden build societi pay minimum balanc £ allianc leicest firstsav pay also start £ interest earn child subject incom tax howev child like adult person incom tax allow £ current tax year account hold money gift friend rel parent interest earn save account may set allow long total amount interest fall within allow tax payabl account open form r avail bank build societi complet confirm account holder nontaxpay allow interest receiv without deduct incom tax tax rule differ parent save behalf child £ interest per parent taxfre interest exce level whole interest tax parent prevent parent hold cash save child name take advantag tax allow parent rel save behalf child consider give open separ account one parent gift one gift rel therefor may prefer parent contribut child trust fund tax free gift rel take total annual £ limit direct deposit account anoth favourit solut premium bond promis rich far great mere deposit account make great present parent guardian respons bond receiv notif purchas prize sent parent child guardian minimum purchas £ bond sell multipl £ gift opportun beyond cash account ignor longer term stock market fund outperform type invest although shorter term volatil one benefit invest child invest gener longer term ten year help reduc risk associ invest share one way spread risk invest stock market unit invest trust pool invest fund give access wide rang share fund may activ manag fund manag pick individu stock base view futur potenti passiv manag invest share compris stock market index exampl ftse exchang trade fund offer altern way track stock market singl share give return underli index realli anoth form tracker differ charg quit low drawback financi gift child gain absolut right money age parent control spent large gift may worthwhil take profession advic establish suitabl trust allow ongo control capit incom
652,475,nintendo adds media playing to ds nintendo is releasing an adapter for its ds handheld console so it can play music and video.  the add-on for the ds means people can download tv programmes  film clips or mp3 files to the adaptor and then play them back while on the move. the release of the media add-on is an attempt by the japanese games giant to protect its dominance of the handheld gaming market. nintendo said the media adapter will be available from february in japan.  the nintendo ds is the successor to the hugely successful gameboy handheld game console and went on sale in japan on 2 december. the ds has two screens  one of which is touch sensitive  and also has on-board a short-range wireless link that lets people play against each other.  the launch of the media adapter  and the attempt to broaden the appeal of the device  is widely seen as a response to the unveiling of the sony psp which was built as a multi-purpose media player and game gadget from the start. sony is thought to be preparing pre-packaged movies and music for the psp. the add-on will also work with the gameboy advance sp. nintendo dominates the handheld gaming console world thanks to successive versions of the gameboy. more than 28 million gameboy advance handhelds have been sold around the world. the dual-screen ds is also thought to be selling well with more than 2.5 million expected to be sold by the end of 2004. nintendo said it had no plans to sell the media adapter outside japan. when it goes on sale the adapter is expected to cost about 5000 yen (£25)  roughly the difference in price between the ds and the higher-priced sony psp.,nintendo add medium play d nintendo releas adapt d handheld consol play music video addon d mean peopl download tv programm film clip mp file adaptor play back move releas medium addon attempt japanes game giant protect domin handheld game market nintendo say medium adapt avail februari japan nintendo d successor huge success gameboy handheld game consol go sale japan decemb d two screen one touch sensit also onboard shortrang wireless link let peopl play launch medium adapt attempt broaden appeal devic wide see respons unveil soni psp built multipurpos medium player game gadget start soni thought prepar prepackag movi music psp addon also work gameboy advanc sp nintendo domin handheld game consol world thank success version gameboy million gameboy advanc handheld sell around world dualscreen d also thought sell well million expect sell end nintendo say plan sell medium adapt outsid japan goe sale adapt expect cost yen £ roughli differ price d higherpr soni psp
653,1280,wales want rugby league training wales could follow england s lead by training with a rugby league club.  england have already had a three-day session with leeds rhinos  and wales are thought to be interested in a similar clinic with rivals st helens. saints coach ian millward has given his approval  but if it does happen it is unlikely to be this season. saints have a week s training in portugal next week  while wales will play england in the opening six nations match on 5 february.  we have had an approach from wales   confirmed a saints spokesman.  it s in the very early stages but it is something we are giving serious consideration to.  st helens  who are proud of their welsh connections  are obvious partners for the welsh rugby union  despite a spat in 2001 over the collapse of kieron cunningham s proposed £500 000 move to union side swansea. a similar cross-code deal that took iestyn harris from leeds to cardiff in 2001 did go through  before the talented stand-off returned to the 13-man code with bradford bulls. kel coslett  who famously moved from wales to league in the 1960s  is currently saints  football manager  while clive griffiths - wales  defensive coach - is a former st helens player and is thought to be the man behind the latest initiative. scott gibbs  the former wales and lions centre  played for st helens from 1994-96 and was in the challenge cup-winning team at wembley in 1996.,wale want rugbi leagu train wale could follow england lead train rugbi leagu club england alreadi threeday session leed rhino wale thought interest similar clinic rival st helen saint coach ian millward give approv happen unlik season saint week train portug next week wale play england open six nation match februari approach wale confirm saint spokesman earli stage someth give seriou consider st helen proud welsh connect obviou partner welsh rugbi union despit spat collaps kieron cunningham propos £ move union side swansea similar crosscod deal take iestyn harri leed cardiff go talent standoff return man code bradford bull kel coslett famous move wale leagu s current saint footbal manag clive griffith wale defens coach former st helen player thought man behind late initi scott gibb former wale lion centr play st helen challeng cupwin team wembley
654,2077,looks and music to drive mobiles mobile phones are still enjoying a boom time in sales  according to research from technology analysts gartner.  more than 674 million mobiles were sold last year globally  said the report  the highest total sold to date. the figure was 30% more than in 2003 and surpassed even the most optimistic predictions  gartner said. good design and the look of a mobile  as well as new services such as music downloads  could go some way to pushing up sales in 2005  said analysts. although people were still looking for better replacement phones  there was evidence  according to gartner  that some markets were seeing a slow-down in replacement sales.   all the markets grew apart from japan which shows that replacement sales are continuing in western europe   mobile analyst carolina milanesi told the bbc news website.  japan is where north america and western european markets can be in a couple of years  time.  they already have tv  music  ringtones  cameras  and all that we can think of on mobiles  so people have stopped buying replacement phones.   but there could be a slight slowdown in sales in european and us markets too  according to gartner  as people wait to see what comes next in mobile technology. this means mobile companies have to think carefully about what they are offering in new models so that people see a compelling reason to upgrade  said gartner. third generation mobiles (3g) with the ability to handle large amounts of data transfer  like video  could drive people into upgrading their phones  but ms milanesi said it was difficult to say how quickly that would happen.  at the end of the day  people have cameras and colour screens on mobiles and for the majority of people out there who don t really care about technology the speed of data to a phone is not critical.  nor would the rush to produce two or three megapixel camera phones be a reason for mobile owners to upgrade on its own. the majority of camera phone models are not at the stage where they can compete with digital cameras which also have flashes and zooms.  more likely to drive sales in 2005 would be the attention to design and aesthetics  as well as music services. the motorola razr v3 phone was typical of the attention to design that would be more commonplace in 2005  she added. this was not a  women s thing   she said  but a desire from men and women to have a gadget that is a form of self-expression too. it was not just about how the phone functioned  but about what it said about its owner.  western europe has always been a market which is quite attentive to design   said ms milanesi.   people are after something that is nice-looking  and together with that  there is the entertainment side.  this year music will have a part to play in this.  the market for full-track music downloads was worth just $20 million (£10.5 million) in 2004  but is set to be worth $1.8 billion (£9.4 million) by 2009  according to jupiter research. sony ericsson just released its walkman branded mobile phone  the w800  which combines a digital music player with up to 30 hours  battery life  and a two megapixel camera. in july last year  motorola and apple announced a version of itunes online music downloading service would be released which would be compatible with motorola mobile phones. apple said the new itunes music player would become motorola s standard music application for its music phones. but the challenge will be balancing storage capacity with battery life if mobile music hopes to compete with digital music players like the ipod. ms milanesi said more models would likely be released in the coming year with hard drives. but they would be more likely to compete with the smaller capacity music players that have around four gigabyte storage capacity  which would not put too much strain on battery life.,look music drive mobil mobil phone still enjoy boom time sale accord research technolog

657,2027,job cuts  false economy   - tuc plans to shed 71 000 civil service jobs will prove to be a  false economy  that could hamper public sector reforms  according to a tuc report.  public and commercial services union members have already voted to strike over cuts for one day on 5 november. the tuc said cuts would deliver less than 6% of the £22bn ministers hope to save through efficiency reforms. general secretary brendan barber warned the  costs could easily outweigh the benefits .  the government s big boost to public spending is now showing results   said mr barber.  public services are improving but looking for simple savings through job cuts at this stage could be a false economy.   they may shoot a tory fox  but cutting thousands of civil service jobs will hit the morale and capabilities of the public servants expected to implement government reforms. the costs could easily outweigh the benefits.  next friday s strike action by the pcs is the biggest in the civil service since 1993  hitting jobcentres  benefit agencies  pensions offices  customs and driving tests. the union says it is concerned about pensions  sick pay and forced relocation as well as the cut in jobs. last month it was announced that a total of 37 social security offices and jobcentres across the uk would close in the first wave of plans to shed civil service jobs. the number of civil servants in britain rose to more than 520 000 in april. other areas the strike will affect include passports  museums and galleries  libraries and health and safety inspections.,job cut fals economi tuc plan shed civil servic job prove fals economi could hamper public sector reform accord tuc report public commerci servic union member alreadi vote strike cut one day novemb tuc say cut would deliv less £bn minist hope save effici reform gener secretari brendan barber warn cost could easili outweigh benefit govern big boost public spend show result say mr barber public servic improv look simpl save job cut stage could fals economi may shoot torus fox cut thousand civil servic job hit moral capabl public servant expect implement govern reform cost could easili outweigh benefit next friday strike action pc big civil servic sinc hit jobcentr benefit agenc pension offic custom drive test union say concern pension sick pay forc reloc well cut job last month announc total social secur offic jobcentr across uk would close first wave plan shed civil servic job number civil servant britain rise april area strike affect includ passport museum galleri librari health safeti inspect
658,794,doors open at biggest gadget fair thousands of technology lovers and industry experts have gathered in las vegas for the annual consumer electronics show (ces).  the fair showcases the latest technologies and gadgets that will hit the shops in the next year. about 50 000 new products will be unveiled as the show unfolds. microsoft chief bill gates is to make a pre-show keynote speech on wednesday when he is expected to announce details of the next generation xbox.  the thrust of this year s show will be on technologies which put people in charge of multimedia content so they can store  listen to  and watch what they want on devices any time  anywhere. about 120 000 people are expected to attend the trade show which stretches over more than 1.5 million square feet. highlights will include the latest trends in digital imaging  storage technologies  thinner flat screen and high-definition tvs  wireless and portable technologies  gaming  and broadband technologies. the show also includes several speeches from key technology companies such as intel  microsoft  and hewlett packard among others.  the story this year remains all about digital and how that is completely transforming and revolutionising products and the way people interact with them   jeff joseph  from the consumer electronics association (cea) told the bbc news website.  it is about personalisation - taking your mp3 player and creating your own playlist  taking your digital video recorder and watch what you want to watch when - you are no longer at the whim of the broadcasters.   consumer electronics and gadgets had a phenomenal year in 2004  according to figures released by ces organisers  the cea  on tuesday. the gadget explosion signalled the strongest growth yet in the us in 2004. shipments of consumer electronics rose by almost 11% between 2003 and 2004. that trend is predicted to continue  according to cea analysts  with wholesale shipments of consumer technologies expected to grow by 11% again in 2005. the fastest-growing technologies in 2004 included blank dvd media  liquid crystal display (lcd) tvs  digital video recorders (dvrs)  and portable music players.  this year we will really begin to see that come to life in what we call place shifting - so if you have your pvr [personal video recorder] in your living room  you can move that content around the house.  some exhibitors will be showcasing how you can take that content anywhere   said mr joseph. he said the products which will be making waves in the next year will be about the  democratisation  of content - devices and technologies that will give people the freedom to do more with music  video  and images. there will also be more focus on the design of technologies  following the lead that apple s ipod made  with ease of use and good looks which appeal to a wider range of people a key concern.  the cea predicted that there would be several key technology trends to watch in the coming year. gaming would continue to thrive  especially on mobile devices  and would reach out to more diverse gamers such as women. games consoles sales have been declining  but the launch of next generation consoles  such as microsoft s xbox and playstation  could buoy up sales. although it has been widely predicted that mr gates would be showcasing the new xbox  some media reports have cast doubt on what he would be talking about in the keynote. some have suggested the announcement may take place at the games developers conference in the summer instead. with more than 52% of us homes expected to have home networks  the cea suggested hard drive boxes - or media servers - capable of storing thousands of images  video and audio files to be accessed through other devices around the home  will be more commonplace. portable devices that combine mobile telephony  digital music and video players  will also be more popular in 2005. their popularity will be driven by more multimedia content and services which will let people watch and listen to films  tv  and audio wherever they are. this means more storage technologies will be in demand  such as external hard drives  and flash memory like sd cards. ces runs officially from 6 to 9 january.,door open big gadget fair thousand technolog lover industri expert gather la vega annual consum electron show ce fair showcas late technolog gadget hit shop next year new product unveil show unfold microsoft chief bill gate make preshow keynot speech wednesday expect announc detail next gener xbox thrust year show technolog put peopl charg multimedia content store listen watch want devic time anywher peopl expect attend trade show stretch million squar foot highlight includ late trend digit imag storag technolog thinner flat screen highdefinit tv wireless portabl technolog game broadband technolog show also includ sever speech key technolog compani intel microsoft hewlett packard among other stori year remain digit complet transform revolutionis product way peopl interact jeff joseph consum electron associ cea told bbc news websit personalis take mp player creat playlist take digit video record watch want watch longer whim broadcast consum electron gadget phenomen year accord figur releas ce organis cea tuesday gadget explos signal strong growth yet u shipment consum electron rise almost trend predict continu accord cea analyst wholesal shipment consum technolog expect grow fastestgrow technolog includ blank dvd medium liquid crystal display lcd tv digit video record dvr portabl music player year realli begin see come life call place shift pvr person video record live room move content around hous exhibitor showcas take content anywher say mr joseph say product make wave next year democratis content devic technolog give peopl freedom music video imag also focu design technolog follow lead appl ipod make ea use good look appeal wider rang peopl key concern cea predict would sever key technolog trend watch come year game would continu thrive especi mobil devic would reach diver gamer woman game consol sale declin launch next gener consol microsoft xbox playstat could buoy sale although wide predict mr gate would showcas new xbox medium report cast doubt would talk keynot suggest announc may take place game develop confer summer instead u home expect home network cea suggest hard drive box medium server capabl store thousand imag video audio file access devic around home commonplac portabl devic combin mobil telephoni digit music video player also popular popular driven multimedia content servic let peopl watch listen film tv audio wherev mean storag technolog demand extern hard drive flash memori like sd card ce run offici januari
659,1734,borders 19-20 ulster ulster clung on for a morale-boosting celtic league win over bottom club borders at netherdale on friday night.  a late try by borders substitute jonny weston had set up a dramatic finish  but the scottish side could not complete the fightback. ulster had led 20-6 with tries from paul steinmetz and bryn cunningham. but the irish province failed to add to the tally in the second half and ended up relieved to get the win to lift them to eighth place in the table. borders had edged ahead with a sixth-minute penalty by charlie hore - only to hand the visitors the initiative via a gift try. calum macrae surrendered possession before centre steinmetz sent a chip into the danger zone. substitute joe pattison - who had come on for the injured gareth morton - wrongly thought the ball was trickling out of play and eased up on the chase.  the speedy steinmetz had other ideas and he raced up to get the vital touch in the nick of time  giving adam larkin an easy conversion. ally warnock clawed back three points for borders  but they were soon hit by another double-blow. first  mark blair was yellow carded for killing the ball on the ground and then full-back cunningham bagged the second touchdown in the wake of fine work by skipper andy ward. larkin again added the extras. even worse was to come for borders when larkin kicked two more penalties just before the break  the second of which also led to kelly brown being sin-binned. the hosts gave themselves a glimmer of hope immediately after the restart  however  when warnock struck a penalty at the other end. and he repeated the feat to set up the tense finale. ulster coach mark mccall said he was delighted to get the victory.  borders are a tougher proposition this year in spite of the fact that they have not had a victory in some time   said mccall.  in the first 20 minutes we were edgy but in the second 20 minutes we played some of our best rugby this season and scored two good tries.   morton  moffat  macrae  hore  berthinussen  warnock  moore  thomson  ford  douglas  blair  stewart  gray  brown  mcentee.  kay  parr  mcgee  rennick  weston  millar  pattison.  cunningham  maxwell  bell  steinmetz  howe  larkin  campbell  s. best  shields  moore  frost  mccullough  ward  feather  n. best.  brady  mccormick  longwell  browne  doak  s. young  bowe.  phil fear (wru),border ulster ulster clung moraleboost celtic leagu win bottom club border netherdal friday night late tri border substitut jonni weston set dramat finish scottish side could complet fightback ulster lead tri paul steinmetz bryn cunningham irish provinc fail add talli second half end reliev get win lift eighth place tabl border edg ahead sixthminut penalti charli hore hand visitor initi via gift tri calum macra surrend posse centr steinmetz sent chip danger zone substitut joe pattison come injur gareth morton wrongli thought ball trickl play ea chase speedi steinmetz idea race get vital touch nick time give adam larkin easi convers alli warnock claw back three point border soon hit anoth doubleblow first mark blair yellow card kill ball ground fullback cunningham bag second touchdown wake fine work skipper andi ward larkin ad extra even wors come border larkin kick two penalti break second also lead kelli brown sinbin host give glimmer hope immedi restart howev warnock struck penalti end repeat feat set ten final ulster coach mark mccall say delight get victori border tougher proposit year spite fact victori time say mccall first minut edgi second minut play best rugbi season score two good tri morton moffat macra hore berthinussen warnock moor thomson ford dougla blair stewart gray brown mcente kay parr mcgee rennick weston millar pattison cunningham maxwel bell steinmetz howe larkin campbel best shield moor frost mccullough ward feather n best bradi mccormick longwel brown doak young bow phil fear wru

661,748,us ahold suppliers face charges us prosecutors have charged nine food suppliers with helping dutch retailer ahold inflate earnings by more than $800m (£428m).  the charges have been brought against individuals as well as companies  alleging they created false accounts. ahold hit the headlines in february 2003 after it emerged that there were accounting irregularities at its us subsidiary foodservice. three former ahold top executives last year agreed to settle fraud charges.  ahold has admitted that it fraudulently inflated promotional allowances at foodservice  improperly consolidated joint ventures and also committed other accounting errors and irregularities.  the nine now charged  who worked as suppliers to ahold  are accused of signing false documents relating to the amount of money they paid the retailer for promoting their products in its stores. food companies pay supermarkets and retailers for prime shelf space. the suppliers in question are said to have inflated the amount of money they paid  providing auditors with signed letters that allowed ahold to inflate its earnings. us attorney david kelley said he expects the nine vendors will plead guilty to the charges. he added that there may be more court actions in the future.  i don t want to leave you with the impression that these were the only ones involved   he said. among those facing charges are john nettle  a former employee of general mills; mark bailin of rymer international seafood; tim daly of michael foods and kenneth bowman  who worked as an independent contractor for total foods.  others include michael hannigan of sugar foods; peter marion of maritime seafood processors and first choice foods; gordon redgate of commodity manager and private label distribution; bruce robinson of basic american foods and michael rogers  formerly of tyson foods. pasquale d amuro of the fbi called the nine vendors the key ingredients in  the process of cooking the books  at ahold. at the time of the scandal  ahold was seen by many as europe s enron. ahold shares tumbled on the news and many market observers predicted that the fall out could damage investor confidence across europe. it was less severe than many had envisaged  however  and since then ahold has worked hard at rebuilding its reputation and investor confidence. ahold is the world s fourth-largest supermarket chain. its other us businesses include stop & shop  and giant food.,u ahold supplier face charg u prosecutor charg nine food supplier help dutch retail ahold inflat earn m £m charg brought individu well compani alleg creat fals account ahold hit headlin februari emerg account irregular u subsidiari foodservic three former ahold top execut last year agre settl fraud charg ahold admit fraudul inflat promot allow foodservic improperli consolid joint ventur also commit account error irregular nine charg work supplier ahold accus sign fals document relat amount money paid retail promot product store food compani pay supermarket retail prime shelf space supplier question say inflat amount money paid provid auditor sign letter allow ahold inflat earn u attorney david kelley say expect nine vendor plead guilti charg ad may court action futur want leav impress one involv say among face charg john nettl former employe gener mill mark bailin rymer intern seafood tim dali michael food kenneth bowman work independ contractor total food other includ michael hannigan sugar food peter marion maritim seafood processor first choic food gordon redgat commod manag privat label distribut bruce robinson basic american food michael roger formerli tyson food pasqual amuro fbi call nine vendor key ingredi process cook book ahold time scandal ahold see mani europ enron ahold share tumbl news mani market observ predict fall could damag investor confid across europ less sever mani envisag howev sinc ahold work hard rebuild reput investor confid ahold world fourthlargest supermarket chain u busi includ stop shop giant food
662,1050,mobiles rack up 20 years of use mobile phones in the uk are celebrating their 20th anniversary this weekend.  britain s first mobile phone call was made across the vodafone network on 1 january 1985 by veteran comedian ernie wise. in the 20 years since that day  mobile phones have become an integral part of modern life and now almost 90% of britons own a handset. mobiles have become so popular that many people use their handset as their only phone and rarely use a landline.  the first ever call over a portable phone was made in 1973 in new york but it took 10 years for the first commercial mobile service to be launched. the uk was not far behind the rest of the world in setting up networks in 1985 that let people make calls while they walked. the first call was made from st katherine s dock to vodafone s head office in newbury which at the time was over a curry house. for the first nine days of 1985 vodafone was the only firm with a mobile network in the uk. then on 10 january cellnet (now o2) launched its service. mike caudwell  spokesman for vodafone  said that when phones were launched they were the size of a briefcase  cost about £2 000 and had a battery life of little more than 20 minutes.   despite that they were hugely popular in the mid-80s   he said.  they became a yuppy must-have and a status symbol among young wealthy business folk.  this was also despite the fact that the phones used analogue radio signals to communicate which made them very easy to eavesdrop on. he said it took vodafone almost nine years to rack up its first million customers but only 18 months to get the second million.  it s very easy to forget that in 1983 when we put the bid document in we were forecasting that the total market would be two million people   he said.  cellnet was forecasting half that.  now vodafone has 14m customers in the uk alone. cellnet and vodafone were the only mobile phone operators in the uk until 1993 when one2one (now t-mobile) was launched. orange had its uk launch in 1994. both newcomers operated digital mobile networks and now all operators use this technology. the analogue spectrum for the old phones has been retired. called global system for mobiles (gsm) this is now the most widely used phone technology on the planet and is used to help more than 1.2 billion people make calls. mr caudwell said the advent of digital technology also helped to introduce all those things  such as text messaging and roaming that have made mobiles so popular.,mobil rack year use mobil phone uk celebr th anniversari weekend britain first mobil phone call make across vodafon network januari veteran comedian erni wise year sinc day mobil phone becom integr part modern life almost briton handset mobil becom popular mani peopl use handset phone rare use landlin first ever call portabl phone make new york take year first commerci mobil servic launch uk far behind rest world set network let peopl make call walk first call make st katherin dock vodafon head offic newburi time curri hous first nine day vodafon firm mobil network uk januari cellnet o launch servic mike caudwel spokesman vodafon say phone launch size briefcas cost £ batteri life littl minut despit huge popular mid say becam yuppi musthav statu symbol among young wealthi busi folk also despit fact phone use analogu radio signal commun make easi eavesdrop say take vodafon almost nine year rack first million custom month get second million easi forget put bid document forecast total market would two million peopl say cellnet forecast half vodafon m custom uk alon cellnet vodafon mobil phone oper uk oneon tmobil launch orang uk launch newcom oper digit mobil network oper use technolog analogu spectrum old phone retir call global system mobil gsm wide use phone technolog planet use help billion peopl make call mr caudwel say advent digit technolog also help introduc thing text messag roam make mobil popular
663,110,web radio takes spanish rap global spin the radio dial in the us and you are likely to find plenty of spanish-language music. but what you will not find is much spanish-language hip-hop.  hip-hop and rap are actually quite popular in the spanish-speaking world  but local artists are having trouble marketing their work abroad. but now  a us company is bringing rap and hip-hop en espanol to computer users everywhere. los caballeros de plan g are one of mexico s hottest hip-hop acts. they have a devoted fan base in their native monterrey. but most mexican hip-hop fans  not to mention fans in most of the spanish-speaking world  rarely get a chance to hear the group s tracks on the radio.   you can t really just go on the radio and listen to hip-hop in spanish... it s just not accessible   says manuel millan  a native of san diego  california.  it s really hard for the spanish hip-hop scene to get into mainstream radio. you usually have a very commercialised sound and the groups are not really known around the country or around the world.  millan and two friends set out to change that - they wanted to make groups like los caballeros de plan g accessible to fans globally.  mainstream radio stations were not going to play this kind of music  and starting their own broadcast station was economically impossible. so  millan and his friends launched a website called latinohiphopradio.com. the name says it all: it is web-based radio  devoted to the hottest spanish language rap and hip-hop tracks. the site  which is in both in english and spanish  is meant to be easy to navigate. all the user has to do is download a media player. there are no djs. it is just music streamed over the net for free. suddenly  with the help of the website  los caballeros de plan g are producing  export quality  rap.  the web might be just the right medium for spanish language hip-hop right now. the genre is in what millan calls its  infant stage . but the production values are improving  and artists such as argentina s mustafa yoda are pushing to make it better and better. mustafa yoda is currently one of the hottest tracks on latinohiphopradio.com.  he s considered the eminem of argentina  and the latin american hip-hop scene   millan says.  he really hasn t had that much exposure as far as anywhere in the world  but he s definitely the one to look out for as far as becoming the next big thing in the spanish-speaking world.  currently  the chilean group makisa is also in latinohiphopradio.com s top 10  as is cuban artist papo record.  every country s got it s own cultural differences and they try to put those into their own songs   millan says. latinohiphopradio.com has been up and running for a couple of months now. the site has listeners from across the spanish speaking world. right now  mexico leads the way  accounting for about 50% of listeners. but web surfers in spain are logging in as well - about 25% of the web station s traffic comes from there. that is not surprising as many consider spain to be the leader in spanish-language rap and hip-hop. millan says that spain is actually just behind the united states and france in terms of overall rap and hip-hop production. that might be changing  though  as more and more latin american artists are finding audiences.  but one spaniard is still firmly in latinohiphopradio.com s top 10. his name is tote king and manuel millan says that he is the hip-hop leader in spain. on his track uno contra veinte emcees  or one against 20 emcees  tote king shows he is well aware of that fact.  it s basically him bragging that he s one of the best emcees in spain right now   millan says.  and it s pretty much true. he has the tightest productions  and his rap flow is impeccable  it s amazing.  latinohiphopradio.com is hoping to expand in the coming year. millan says they want to include more music and more news from the world of spanish language hip-hop and rap.  clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world  a bbc world service and wgbh-boston co-production.,web radio take spanish rap global spin radio dial u like find plenti spanishlanguag music find much spanishlanguag hiphop hiphop rap actual quit popular spanishspeak world local artist troubl market work abroad u compani bring rap hiphop en espanol comput user everywher lo caballero de plan g one mexico hottest hiphop act devot fan base nativ monterrey mexican hiphop fan mention fan spanishspeak world rare get chanc hear group track radio realli go radio listen hiphop spanish access say manuel millan nativ san diego california realli hard spanish hiphop scene get mainstream radio usual commercialis sound group realli know around countri around world millan two friend set chang want make group like lo caballero de plan g access fan global mainstream radio station go play kind music start broadcast station econom imposs millan friend launch websit call latinohiphopradiocom name say webbas radio devot hottest spanish languag rap hiphop track site english spanish meant easi navig user download medium player dj music stream net free suddenli help websit lo caballero de plan g produc export qualiti rap web might right medium spanish languag hiphop right genr millan call infant stage product valu improv artist argentina mustafa yoda push make well well mustafa yoda current one hottest track latinohiphopradiocom consid eminem argentina latin american hiphop scene millan say realli much exposur far anywher world definit one look far becom next big thing spanishspeak world current chilean group makisa also latinohiphopradiocom top cuban artist papo record everi countri get cultur differ tri put song millan say latinohiphopradiocom run coupl month site listen across spanish speak world right mexico lead way account listen web surfer spain log well web station traffic come surpris mani consid spain leader spanishlanguag rap hiphop millan say spain actual behind unit state franc term overal rap hiphop product might chang though latin american artist find audienc one spaniard still firmli latinohiphopradiocom top name tote king manuel millan say hiphop leader spain track uno contra veint emce one emce tote king show well awar fact basic brag one best emce spain right millan say pretti much true tightest product rap flow impecc amaz latinohiphopradiocom hope expand come year millan say want includ music news world spanish languag hiphop rap clark boyd technolog correspond world bbc world servic wgbhboston coproduct
664,1408,split-caps pay £194m compensation investors who lost money following the split-capital investment trust scandal are to receive £194m compensation  the uk s financial watchdog has announced.  eighteen investment firms involved in the sale of the investments agreed the compensation package with the financial services authority (fsa). splits were marketed as a low-risk way to benefit from rising share prices. but when the stock market collapsed in 2000  the products left thousands of investors out of pocket. an estimated 50 000 people took out split-capital funds  some investing their life savings in the schemes. the paying of compensation will be overseen by an independent company  the fsa said.  further details of how investors will be able to claim their share of the compensation package will be announced in the new year.  this should save investors from having to take their case to the financial ombudsman service  something  no doubt  that will be very welcome   rob mcivor  fsa spokesman  told bbc news. agreeing to pay compensation did not mean that the eighteen firms involved were admitting any guilt  the fsa added. any investor accepting the compensation will have to waive the right to take their case to the financial ombudsman service.  the fsa has been investigating whether investors were misled about the risks posed by split-capital investment trusts. the fsa s 60 strong investigation team looked into whether fund managers colluded in a so-called  magic circle   in the hope of propping up one another s share prices.  firms involved were presented with 780 files of evidence detailing 27 000 taped conversations and over 70 interviews. in may  the fsa was widely reported as having asked firms to pay up to £350m in compensation. mr mcivor told the bbc that the final settlement figure was smaller because two unnamed firms had pulled out of the compensation negotiations. investors in these two firms may now have to take any compensation claim to the financial ombudsman service or the courts.,splitcap pay £m compens investor lose money follow splitcapit invest trust scandal receiv £m compens uk financi watchdog announc eighteen invest firm involv sale invest agre compens packag financi servic author fsa split market lowrisk way benefit rise share price stock market collaps product left thousand investor pocket estim peopl take splitcapit fund invest life save scheme pay compens overseen independ compani fsa say detail investor abl claim share compens packag announc new year save investor take case financi ombudsman servic someth doubt welcom rob mcivor fsa spokesman told bbc news agre pay compens mean eighteen firm involv admit guilt fsa ad investor accept compens waiv right take case financi ombudsman servic fsa investig whether investor misl risk pose splitcapit invest trust fsa strong investig team look whether fund manag collud socal magic circl hope prop one anoth share price firm involv present file evid detail tape convers interview may fsa wide report ask firm pay £m compens mr mcivor told bbc final settlement figur small two unnam firm pull compens negoti investor two firm may take compens claim financi ombudsman servic court

667,935,civil servants in strike ballot the uk s biggest civil service union is to ballot its 290 000 members on strikes in protest at government plans to extend their pension age to 65.  the public and commercial services union will co-ordinate any action with up to six other public sector unions. unions have already earmarked 23 march for a one-day strike which could involve up to 1.4 million uk workers. the government says unions will be consulted before any changes are made to the pension system.  pcs leader mark serwotka warned there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink.   for a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service  choice on this and choice on that - isn t it ironic that they re saying to public sector workers there is no choice   he said.  if you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years - that is working until people drop.  in the 20th century  it s completely unacceptable.  bbc correspondent stephen cape said the combined unions represented  a formidable force  which could embarrass the government in the run-up to the general election. a stoppage involving civil servants  in particular  could seriously disrupt or close government departments  agencies and museums  he said.  opposition to raising the retirement age is  one thing all the unions are agreed on   our correspondent added. unison s 800 000 workers  the transport and general workers  union s 70 000 and amicus  20 000 are among those being balloted about a 23 march walkout. deputy prime minister john prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures on thursday night. our correspondent said that he understood no deal had been offered in that meeting but that there was room for further negotiations. there was  some possibility  of the strike action being avoided  he added.,civil servant strike ballot uk big civil servic union ballot member strike protest govern plan extend pension age public commerci servic union coordin action six public sector union union alreadi earmark march oneday strike could involv million uk worker govern say union consult chang make pension system pc leader mark serwotka warn could walkout unless govern rethink govern lectur everyon choic choic public servic choic choic iron say public sector worker choic say want pension promis start must work extra five year work peopl drop th centuri complet unaccept bbc correspond stephen cape say combin union repres formid forc could embarrass govern runup gener elect stoppag involv civil servant particular could serious disrupt close govern depart agenc museum say opposit rais retir age one thing union agre correspond ad unison worker transport gener worker union amicu among ballot march walkout deputi prime minist john prescott held privat meet senior union figur thursday night correspond say understood deal offer meet room negoti possibl strike action avoid ad
668,53,standard life cuts policy bonuses standard life  europe s largest mutual life insurer  has cut bonuses for with-profit policyholders.  annual bonus rates on its with-profits life policies were cut from 2.5% to 2%  while bonuses on pension policies were reduced from 3.25% to 2.5%. it is the sixth time in three years standard life has made cuts to bonus rates  despite an 8.7% rise in the value of the with-profits fund in 2004. the insurer blamed the cuts on poor share returns and low interest rates.  with-profits policies are designed to smooth out the peaks and troughs of stock market volatility. profits made in good years are kept in reserve to pay investors an annual bonus even when the stock market performs badly. slumping share prices throughout 2001 and 2002 forced most firms to trim bonus rates on their policies. standard life came in for criticism for sticking with stock market investments during 2001 and 2002. the insurer argued that shares outperformed other investments over the long term and that policyholders would feel the benefit when the stock market recovered. recently  norwich union and axa sun life both cut their with-profit bonus rates.  john gill  managing director of the insurer s life and pensions division  said that a strong stock market recovery in the past two years had only  partly compensated for losses during 2001 and 2002 . in addition  low interest rates meant that  long-term investment returns are well below historic levels   mr gill added. however  mr gill maintained that with-profits continued to perform well over the long term.  our payouts continue to stand up well against other types of long-term investments over similar periods   he said. standard life has an estimated 2.4 million with-profits policyholders. last year  the company announced that it was looking to float on the stock market in 2006.,standard life cut polici bonus standard life europ large mutual life insur cut bonus withprofit policyhold annual bonu rate withprofit life polici cut bonus pension polici reduc sixth time three year standard life make cut bonu rate despit rise valu withprofit fund insur blame cut poor share return low interest rate withprofit polici design smooth peak trough stock market volatil profit make good year kept reserv pay investor annual bonu even stock market perform badli slump share price throughout forc firm trim bonu rate polici standard life come critic stick stock market invest insur argu share outperform invest long term policyhold would feel benefit stock market recov recent norwich union axa sun life cut withprofit bonu rate john gill manag director insur life pension divis say strong stock market recoveri past two year partli compens loss addit low interest rate meant longterm invest return well histor level mr gill ad howev mr gill maintain withprofit continu perform well long term payout continu stand well type longterm invest similar period say standard life estim million withprofit policyhold last year compani announc look float stock market

671,487,kennedy looks to election gains they may not know quite how to describe their position in british politics - the real opposition  the valid opposition  the effective opposition or the authentic opposition.  but the liberal democrats are entering the expected 2005 election campaign determined to prove it is they  not the tories  who are now the real threat to labour. as tory leader michael howard kicked off his election campaign  the lib dem leader charles kennedy dismissed the conservatives as a  fading  force. and he insisted there was  no limit  to his party s ambitions in the coming poll. and he can produce some pretty impressive recent election results to back up his optimism for an election which he believes might just see his party doing big things. sensible third party leaders are usually cautious about making any predictions about how they will do come the big test.  and mr kennedy was not falling into that trap when he fired up his campaign from the party s westminster hq. he would make no predictions other than that he expected the lib dems to increase both their votes and their commons seats at the election.  the gap between labour and the tories was now so narrow - as proved  he claimed  by the defection to labour of robert jackson - that only his party offered a genuine alternative. on the war on iraq  identity cards  student fees and the council tax  there was nothing to chose between the two big parties whereas the liberal democrats offered costed  sensible alternatives. he was also happy to break the two party consensus on taxation by promising to increase income tax on those earning more than £100 000 a year to pay for the scrapping of student fees  the introduction of free personal care for the elderly and replacing the council tax with a local income tax. he was also happy to offer a pledge that he would be doing no deals to  prop up  either of the other big parties after the election.  there was a time when such optimistic sounds coming from the third party could be dismissed as self-delusion. that is no longer the case with the liberal democrats. the other parties will still insist that the lib dems are no hopers whose greatest effect on the poll will be to boost the hopes of their opponents by denying them otherwise winnable seats.  labour  in particular  fears that disillusioned supporters may switch to the lib dems allowing the tories to win some seats. but mr kennedy is clearly hoping for a more significant outcome than that. he will not talk about the big breakthrough  although there are those who believe this could well be the election that sees his party crossing some sort of symbolic threshold. they would argue that  by the time of the election after next  the liberal democrats may genuinely have replaced the tories as the party challenging labour for power. the lib dems will hope to have made advances because of their consistent stand against the war on iraq. but mr kennedy believes his new manifesto will also offer sensible  costed and achievable policies on things like the council tax  crime and asylum that will underpin his claim that his party really is the only opposition worth the name.,kennedi look elect gain may know quit describ posit british polit real opposit valid opposit effect opposit authent opposit liber democrat enter expect elect campaign determin prove torus real threat labour torus leader michael howard kick elect campaign lib dem leader charl kennedi dismiss conserv fade forc insist limit parti ambit come poll produc pretti impress recent elect result back optim elect believ might see parti big thing sensibl third parti leader usual cautiou make predict come big test mr kennedi fall trap fire campaign parti westminst hq would make predict expect lib dem increas vote common seat elect gap labour torus narrow prove claim defect labour robert jackson parti offer genuin altern war iraq ident card student fee council tax noth chose two big parti wherea liber democrat offer cost sensibl altern also happi break two parti consensu taxat promis increas incom tax earn £ year pay scrap student fee introduct free person care elderli replac council tax local incom tax also happi offer pledg would deal prop either big parti elect time optimist sound come third parti could dismiss selfdelus longer case liber democrat parti still insist lib dem hoper whose great effect poll boost hope oppon deni otherwis winnabl seat labour particular fear disillus support may switch lib dem allow torus win seat mr kennedi clearli hope signific outcom talk big breakthrough although believ could well elect see parti cross sort symbol threshold would argu time elect next liber democrat may genuin replac torus parti challeng labour power lib dem hope make advanc consist stand war iraq mr kennedi believ new manifesto also offer sensibl cost achiev polici thing like council tax crime asylum underpin claim parti realli opposit worth name

673,1089,germany calls for eu reform german chancellor gerhard schroeder has called for radical reform of the eu s stability pact to grant countries more flexibility over their budget deficits.  mr schroeder said existing fiscal rules should be loosened to allow countries to run deficits above the current 3% limit if they met certain criteria. writing in the financial times  mr schroeder also said heads of government should have a greater say in reforms. changes to the pact are due to be agreed at an economic summit in march.  the current eu rules limit the size of a eurozone country s deficit to 3% of gdp. countries which exceed the threshold are liable to heavy fines by the european commission  although several countries  including germany  have breached the rules consistently since 2002 without facing punishment. the european commission acknowledged last month that it would not impose sanctions on countries who break the rules.  mr schroeder - a staunch supporter of the pact when it was set up in the 1990s - said exemptions were now needed to take into account the cost of domestic reform programmes and changing economic conditions.  the stability pact will work better if intervention by european institutions in the budgetary sovereignty of national parliaments is only permitted under very limited conditions   he wrote.  only if their competences are respected will the member states be willing to align their policies more consistently with the economic goals of the eu.   deficits should be allowed to rise above 3%  mr schroeder argued  if countries meet several  mandatory criteria . these include governments which are adopting costly structural reforms  countries which are suffering economic stagnation and nations which are shouldering  special economic burdens . the proposed changes would make it harder for the european commission to launch infringement action against any state which breaches the pact s rules. mr schroeder s intervention comes ahead of a meeting of the 12 eurozone finance ministers on monday to discuss the pact. the issue will also be discussed at tuesday s ecofin meeting of the finance ministers of all 25 eu members. mr schroeder also called for heads of government to play a larger role in shaping reforms to the pact. a number of eu finance ministers are believed to favour only limited changes to the eurozone s rules.,germani call eu reform german chancellor gerhard schroeder call radic reform eu stabil pact grant countri flexibl budget deficit mr schroeder say exist fiscal rule loosen allow countri run deficit current limit met certain criterion write financi time mr schroeder also say head govern great say reform chang pact due agre econom summit march current eu rule limit size eurozon countri deficit gdp countri exceed threshold liabl heavi fine european commiss although sever countri includ germani breach rule consist sinc without face punish european commiss acknowledg last month would impos sanction countri break rule mr schroeder staunch support pact set s say exempt need take account cost domest reform programm chang econom condit stabil pact work well intervent european institut budgetari sovereignti nation parliament permit limit condit write compet respect member state will align polici consist econom goal eu deficit allow rise mr schroeder argu countri meet sever mandatori criterion includ govern adopt costli structur reform countri suffer econom stagnat nation shoulder special econom burden propos chang would make harder european commiss launch infring action state breach pact rule mr schroeder intervent come ahead meet eurozon financ minist monday discus pact issu also discus tuesday ecofin meet financ minist eu member mr schroeder also call head govern play large role shape reform pact number eu financ minist believ favour limit chang eurozon rule
674,1106,gazprom  in $36m back-tax claim  the nuclear unit of russian energy giant gazprom is reportedly facing a 1bn rouble ($35.7m; £19.1m) back-tax claim for the 2001-2003 period.  vedomosti newspaper reported that russian authorities made the demand at the end of last year. the paper added that most of the taxes claimed are linked to the company s export activity. gazprom  the biggest gas company in the world  took over nuclear fuel giant atomstroieksport in october 2004. the main project of atomstroieksport is the building of a nuclear plant in iran  which has been a source of tension between russia and the us.  gazprom is one of the key players in the complex russian energy market  where the government of vladimir putin has made moves to regain state influence over the sector. gazprom is set to merge with state oil firm rosneft  the company that eventually acquired yuganskneftegas  the main unit of embattled oil giant yukos. claims for back-taxes was a tool used against yukos  and led to the enforced sale yuganskneftegas. some analysts fear the kremlin will continue to use these sort of moves to boost the efforts of the state to regain control over strategically important sectors such as oil.,gazprom m backtax claim nuclear unit russian energi giant gazprom reportedli face bn roubl m £m backtax claim period vedomosti newspap report russian author make demand end last year paper ad tax claim link compani export activ gazprom big ga compani world take nuclear fuel giant atomstroieksport octob main project atomstroieksport build nuclear plant iran sourc tension russia u gazprom one key player complex russian energi market govern vladimir putin make move regain state influenc sector gazprom set merg state oil firm rosneft compani eventu acquir yuganskneftega main unit embattl oil giant yuko claim backtax tool use yuko lead enforc sale yuganskneftega analyst fear kremlin continu use sort move boost effort state regain control strateg import sector oil
675,1358,bond game fails to shake or stir for gaming fans  the word goldeneye evokes excited memories not only of the james bond revival flick of 1995  but also the classic shoot-em-up that accompanied it and left n64 owners glued to their consoles for many an hour.  adopting that hallowed title somewhat backfires on this new game  for it fails to deliver on the promise of its name and struggles to generate the original s massive sense of fun. this however is not a sequel  nor does it relate to the goldeneye film. you are the eponymous renegade spy  an agent who deserts to the bond world s extensive ranks of criminal masterminds  after being deemed too brutal for mi6. your new commander-in-chief is the portly auric goldfinger  last seen in 1964  but happily running around bent on world domination. with a determination to justify its name which is even less convincing than that of tina turner s similarly-titled theme song  the game literally gives the player a golden eye following an injury  which enables a degree of x-ray vision.  rogue agent signals its intentions by featuring james bond initially and proceeding to kill him off within moments  squashed by a plummeting helicopter. the notion is of course to add a novel dark edge to a 007 game  but the premise simply does not get the juices flowing like it needs to.  recent bond games like nightfire and everything or nothing were very competent and did a fine job of capturing the sense of flair  invention and glamour of the film franchise. this title lacks that aura  and when the bond magic shines through  it feels like a lucky accident. the central problem is that the gameplay just is not good enough. quite aside from the bizarre inability to jump  the even more bizarre glaring graphical bugs and dubious enemy ai  the levels simply are not put together with much style or imagination. admittedly the competition has been tough  even in recent weeks  with the likes of halo 2 and half life 2 triumphing in virtually every department. what the game is good at is enveloping you in noisy  dynamic scenes of violent chaos. as is the trend of late  you are made to feel like you are in the midst of a really messy and fraught encounter. sadly that sense of action is outweighed by the difficulty of navigating and battling within the chaos  meaning that frustration is often the outcome. and irregular save points mean you have to backtrack each time you are killed. a minute red dot passes for a crosshair  although the collision-detection is so suspect that the difficulties of aiming weapons are compensated for. shooting enemies from a distance can be tricky  and you will not always know you have picked them off  since dead enemies vanish literally before they have fully hit the floor  and they do so in some woefully uninspiring death animations. it is perhaps indicative of a lack of confidence that the game maker s allow you several different weapons almost immediately and throw you quickly into raging firefights - no time is risked with a measured build-up.  by far the most satisfying element of the game is seeing old favourites like dr no  goldfinger  hat-fiend oddjob and crazed russian sex beast xenia onatopp resurrected after all these years  and with their faces rendered in an impressively recognisable fashion.  there is a real thrill from doing battle with these legendary villains  and it is a testament to the power of the bond universe that they can cut such a dash. but the in-game niggles  combined with a story and presentation that just do not feel sufficiently well thought-through  will make this a disappointment for most. diehard fans of bond will probably find enough here to make it a worthwhile purchase and try to ignore the failings. the game is weak  not completely unplayable. then again  007 fanatics may also take umbrage at the cavalier blending of characters from different eras. given james bond s healthy pedigree in past games  there is every reason to hope that this is just a blip  a commendable idea that just has not worked  that will be rectified when the character inevitably makes his return.  goldeneye: rogue agent is out now,bond game fail shake stir game fan word goldeney evok excit memori jame bond reviv flick also classic shootemup accompani left n owner glu consol mani hour adopt hallow titl somewhat backfir new game fail deliv promis name struggl gener origin massiv sen fun howev sequel relat goldeney film eponym renegad spi agent desert bond world extens rank crimin mastermind deem brutal mi new commanderinchief portli auric goldfing last see happili run around bent world domin determin justifi name even less convinc tina turner similarlytitl theme song game liter give player golden eye follow injuri enabl degre xray vision rogu agent signal intent featur jame bond initi proceed kill within moment squash plummet helicopt notion cours add novel dark edg game premis simpli get juic flow like need recent bond game like nightfir everyth noth compet fine job captur sen flair invent glamour film franchis titl lack aura bond magic shine feel like lucki accid central problem gameplay good enough quit asid bizarr inabl jump even bizarr glare graphic bug dubiou enemi ai level simpli put togeth much style imagin admittedli competit tough even recent week like halo half life triumph virtual everi depart game good envelop noisi dynam scene violent chao trend late make feel like midst realli messi fraught encount sadli sen action outweigh difficulti navig battl within chao mean frustrat often outcom irregular save point mean backtrack time kill minut red dot pas crosshair although collisiondetect suspect difficulti aim weapon compens shoot enemi distanc tricki alway know pick sinc dead enemi vanish liter fulli hit floor woefulli uninspir death anim perhap indic lack confid game maker allow sever differ weapon almost immedi throw quickli rage firefight time risk measur buildup far satisfi element game see old favourit like dr goldfing hatfiend oddjob craze russian sex beast xenia onatopp resurrect year face render impress recognis fashion real thrill battl legendari villain testament power bond univers cut dash ingam niggl combin stori present feel suffici well thoughtthrough make disappoint diehard fan bond probabl find enough make worthwhil purchas tri ignor fail game weak complet unplay fanat may also take umbrag cavali blend charact differ era give jame bond healthi pedigre past game everi reason hope blip commend idea work rectifi charact inevit make return goldeney rogu agent

677,1401,be careful how you code a new european directive could put software writers at risk of legal action  warns former programmer and technology analyst bill thompson.  if it gets its way  the dutch government will conclude its presidency of the european union by pushing through a controversial measure that has been rejected by the european parliament  lacks majority support from national governments and will leave millions of european citizens in legal limbo and facing the possibility of court cases against them. if the new law was about border controls  defence or even the new constitution  then our tv screens would be full of experts agonising over the impact on our daily lives. sadly for those who will be directly affected  the controversy concerns the patenting of computer programs  a topic that may excite the bloggers  campaigning groups and technical press but does not obsess middle britain. after all  how much fuss can you generate about the directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions  and the way it amends article 52 of the 1973 european patent convention  yet if the new directive is nodded through at the next meeting of one of the eu s ministerial councils  as seems likely  it will allow programs to be patented in europe just as they are in the us. many observers of the computing scene  including myself  think the results will be disastrous for small companies  innovative programmers and the free and open source software movement. it will let large companies patent all sorts of ideas and give legal force to those who want to limit their competitors  use of really obvious ideas.  in the us you cannot build a system that stores customer credit card details so that they can pay without having to re-enter them unless amazon lets you  because they hold the patent on  one-click  online purchase. it is a small invention  but amazon made it to the patent office first and now owns it.  we are relatively free from this sort of thing over here  but perhaps not for long. the new proposals go back to 2002  although argument about patentability of software and computer-implemented inventions has been going on since at least the mid-1980s. they have come to a head now after a year in which proposals were made  endorsed by the council of ministers  radically modified by the european parliament and then re-presented in their original form. some national governments seem to be aware of the problems. poland has rejected the proposal and germany s main political parties have opposed it  but there is not enough opposition to guarantee their rejection. early in december the british government held a consultation meeting with those who had commented on the proposals. science minister lord sainsbury went along to listen and outline the uk position  but according to those present  it was embarrassing to see how little the minister and his officials actually understood the issues concerned.  the draft directive is being put through the council as what is called an  a  item and can only be approved or rejected. no discussion or amendment is allowed. so why should we be worried  first  there is the abuse of the democratic process involved in disregarding the views of the parliament and abandoning all of their carefully argued amendments. this goes to the heart of the european project  and even those who do not care about software or patents should be worried. if coders are treated like this today  who is to say that it will not be you tomorrow   more directly  once software patents are granted then any programmer will have to worry that the code they are writing is infringing someone else s patent. this is not about stealing software  as code is already protected by copyright. patents are not copyright  but something much stronger. a patent gives the owner the right to stop anyone else using their invention  even if the other person invented it separately. i have never  to my shame  managed to read lord byron s childe harold s pilgrimage. if it was pointed out that one of my articles contained a substantial chunk of the poem then i could defend myself in court by claiming that i had simply made it up and it was coincidence. the same does not hold for a patent. if i sit down this afternoon and write a brilliant graphics compression routine and it happens to be the same as the lzw algorithm used in gif files  then i am in trouble under patent law  at least in the us. coincidence is no defence. the proposed directive is supported by many of the major software companies  but this is hardly surprising since most of them are us-based and they have already had to cope with a legal environment that allows patents. they have legal departments and  more crucially  patents of their own which they can trade or cross-license with other patent holders.  even this system breaks down  of course  as microsoft found out last year when they initially lost a case brought by eolas which claimed that internet explorer (and other browsers) infringed an eolas patent. that one was eventually thrown out  but only after months of uncertainty and millions of dollars. but small companies  and the free and open software movement do not have any patents to trade. much of the really useful software we use every day  programs like the apache web server  the gnu/linux operating system and the fearsomely popular firefox browser  is developed outside company structures by people who do not have legal departments to check for patent infringements. the damage to software will not happen overnight  of course. if the directive goes through it has to be written into national laws and then there will be a steady stream of legal actions against small companies and open source products. eventually someone will decide to attack linux directly  probably with some secret funding from one or two large players. the new directive will limit innovation by forcing programmers to spend time checking for patent infringements or simply avoiding working in potentially competitive areas. and it will damage europe s computer industry. we can only hope that the council of ministers has the integrity and strength to reject this bad law.  bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital.,care code new european direct could

682,491,giggs handed wales leading role ryan giggs will captain wales as he wins his 50th cap in wednesday s friendly against hungary in cardiff.  john toshack  in his first game as coach after succeeding mark hughes  admits he is surprised that giggs has only just reached the landmark.  with the games he s played for united  proportionately it doesn t seem that many for wales   toshack said.  but he s one of the greatest of all welsh internationals and on his 50th cap it s appropriate he s captain.  giggs admits he had briefly considered retirement from the international game  but is now targetting playing for wales in the 2008 european championships. the manchester united wing revealed how club manager sir alex ferguson talked him into extending his wales career.  i briefly discussed my international future with sir alex  but he urged me to carry on   giggs said.  he feels  like myself  that i have no weight problems and keep myself fit  so in three or four years  time i will be able to play in the european finals if we get there.  the manager has always wanted me to play for my club and country and he was keen for me to continue because i am fit enough.   giggs admits he was wavering and considering joining the likes of former wales skipper gary speed and united team-mate paul scholes in committing the remaining years of his career to club football. but giggs is now focussed on making the toshack era even more successful than the time hughes spent at the helm. the manchester united winger won his first cap as a 17-year-old in 1991  an away loss to germany  and now faces his landmark appearance at the age of 31. with giggs leading wales out against hungary  there is every chance that he will become the permanent successor to speed. however  toshack refused to reveal whether he sees giggs as a long-term option.  for this particular game i think it is appropriate that ryan giggs will be captain  it s his 50th cap and he s known for some time about that   toshack said. on wednesday night toshack takes charge of his first match since replacing hughes  and giggs said:  it s my 50th cap and i am looking forward to it  and i hope to play a lot more times from here on in.  it s important to be here  all the players feel the same. it s a new start and all the top players certainly see it as important.  i see myself leading by example  it is something i have taken on for wales as well as united these past few seasons.  the way john is looking at things  he is aiming to build his side around the experienced lads right up to the next tournament  the euro 2006 event.  i have told john i will be around for the next european tournament  by then i will be 35 so hopefully i will still be okay.  a lot can happen  but i m hoping to be around.  giggs  own personal future at old trafford is still up in the air as he has yet to reach agreement on a new contract  with manchester united offering one extra year and giggs seeking two.  i have put the contract thing to the back of my mind at the moment   said giggs.  it is an important period for the club and i am just concentrated on that.  i ve heard the suggestions  hopefully there is a two-year deal about to be offered because that is what i am looking for  to get it sorted out.  i m enjoying my football  the way united have been playing and my own form  you have to enjoy it.  we have massive games coming up: manchester city this week  then the everton cup tie  followed by ac milan in the champions league  and my first wales game under john toshack  so it s an important

686,831,chelsea hold arsenal a gripping game between arsenal and chelsea ended with the honours finishing even at highbury.  thierry henry produced a sublime strike to put arsenal ahead but john terry levelled with a powerful header. henry s quickly-taken free-kick put arsenal back in front but eidur gudjohnsen equalised with a header from william gallas  knockback. henry missed a golden chance when he blazed a shot high late on and arsenal also had a penalty appeal rejected. henry s opener had given arsenal the perfect start and set up an enthralling affair. the french striker headed a long cesc faregas ball back to jose antonio reyes from the edge of the chelsea area and immediately saw it headed back into his path from the spaniard. and  with his back to goal  henry finished with aplomb when he took one touch  turned and struck an angled strike past the despairing dive of keeper petr cech. henry epitomised a determination about the arsenal side but chelsea appeared unruffled and equalised after 16 minutes.  gunners keeper manuel almunia  who got the nod ahead of jens lehmann  did well to save a well-struck frank lampard shot. but he could not keep out terry s powered header from the resultant corner as arsenal s weakness at set-pieces was again exposed. almost immediately  henry went close and chelsea gathered the loose ball before going straight up the other end where gudjohnsen fluffed an effort. gudjohnsen did not make the same error minutes later when he struck a sweet shot only for almunia to be equal to the task and save. the homes side regained the lead in controversial fashion when robert pires won a dubious free-kick. and  given the option to take the 25-yard set-piece quickly  henry curled in a shot with cech still organising his wall.  this time arsenal did not allow chelsea to level so soon as they went into the break ahead. chelsea brought striker didier drogba on to partner gudjohnsen up front after the interval and the move reaped immediate reward. lampard swung in a cross which gallas knocked back across goal and a deft header from gudjohnsen levelled matters again. chelsea s main threat was coming from crosses and lampard missed a great opportunity as he headed wide when left unmarked at the far post. the second half failed to live up to the thrilling pace of the opening period but there were flashes of brilliance. one of them came from the enigmatic robben when he jinked his way through two arsenal defenders only to see his poked shot saved by almunia.  arsenal ended the match the stronger and worked a excellent chance for henry who put a left-foot shot high from eight yards. subtitute robin van persie could also have nicked a win for the highbury outfit but frustratingly sidefooted just wide. matthieu flamini had a late penal appeal waved away before the final whistle which maintained chelsea five-point premiership lead over arsenal.  almunia  lauren  toure  campbell  cole  pires  flamini  fabregas

687,878,nintendo handheld given euro date nintendo s new handheld console  the ds  will launch in europe on 11 march  the company has announced.  the portable games machine  which features touch-screen control  will retail for £99 in the uk (149 euros). nintendo said 15 games would be available in the uk at launch  with prices ranging from £19 to £29. more than 2.8 million ds consoles have been sold since it first appeared in the us and japan at the end of 2004. rival sony has said it will launch its first handheld console  the psp  in the us and europe before the end of march. the psp is expected to compete for a large part of the same handheld market  despite sony s assertion that the machines are aimed at different consumers.  the 15 games available on the european launch date will include nintendo s super mario 64 ds  as well as titles from third-party developers such as ubisoft s rayman ds.  more than 120 games are in development for the new console  nintendo has said. the ds is backwards compatible with the game boy advance  allowing the earlier machine s back catalogue of 700 games to be played. additionally  a short-range wireless link for multiplayer gaming is built in to the ds  with a  download play  option which allows a group to play against each other  even if just one person owns a copy. other features include a short-range messaging application called pictochat  and a built-in microphone which is used in sega s launch title project rub. nintendo has also announced a media adapter  which will allow the console to play music and video on the move.  the launch price of £99 (149 euros) compares favourably with the us price of $149  according to john houlihan  editor of the computerandvideogames.com magazine.  it s a very  very competitive price point. there are some innovative features  and nintendo has created quite a buzz   he says.  however  the line-up of games could have been stronger. everyone wanted to see the eight-player mario kart ds  for example.   mr houlihan believes that there is likely to be an audience for both the nintendo ds and sony s new psp  with the former aimed largely at a younger audience and the latter expected to be marketed as a multimedia device.  the psp is a sexy bit of kit  but sony s attitude to the psp has been very understated in europe  so far   mr houlihan said. the worldwide handheld software market had an estimated worth of $2.6bn at the end of 2004  according to industry analysts screen digest.  in the past  games consoles and handhelds have generally launched much later in europe than in other parts of the world. however nintendo president satoru iwata said the company was  pleased to have offered such a short period of time between the us and european launch .  europe is an extremely important market for nintendo   mr iwata added. nintendo raised its sales targets for the ds console last december after selling a million in the us and japan in just a few weeks.,nintendo handheld give euro date nintendo new handheld consol d launch europ march compani announc portabl game machin featur touchscreen control retail £ uk euro nintendo say game would avail uk launch price rang £ £ million d consol sell sinc first appear u japan end rival soni say launch first handheld consol psp u europ end march psp expect compet larg part handheld market despit soni assert machin aim differ consum game avail european launch date includ nintendo super mario d well titl thirdparti develop ubisoft rayman d game develop new consol nintendo say d backward compat game boy advanc allow earlier machin back catalogu game play addit shortrang wireless link multiplay game built d download play option allow group play even one person own copi featur includ shortrang messag applic call pictochat builtin microphon use sega launch titl project rub nintendo also announc medium adapt allow consol play music video move launch price £ euro compar favour u price accord john houlihan editor computerandvideogamescom magazin competit price point innov featur nintendo creat quit buzz say howev lineup game could strong everyon want see eightplay mario kart d exampl mr houlihan believ like audienc nintendo d soni new psp former aim larg young audienc latter expect market multimedia devic psp sexi bit kit soni attitud psp underst europ far mr houlihan say worldwid handheld softwar market estim worth bn end accord industri analyst screen digest past game consol handheld gener launch much later europ part world howev nintendo presid satoru iwata say compani plea offer short period time u european launch europ extrem import market nintendo mr iwata ad nintendo rais sale target d consol last decemb sell million u japan week

689,1436,banker loses sexism claim a former executive at the london offices of merrill lynch has lost her £7.5m ($14.6m) sex discrimination case against the us investment bank.  an employment tribunal dismissed stephanie villalba s allegations of sexual discrimination and unequal pay. but the 42-year-old won her claim of unfair dismissal  resulting from her sacking in august 2003. her partial victory is likely to cap her compensation to about £55 000  a tiny fraction of what she asked for. the extent of damages will be assessed in the new year. the action - the biggest claim heard by an employment tribunal in the uk - had been viewed as something of a test case.  the tribunal decided that ms villalba had been unfairly dismissed because  having been removed from a senior post  she was entitled to wait to see if a suitable alternative position could be found in the organisation. ms villalba  the former head of merrill s private client business in europe  has made no decision on whether to appeal.  a spokesman for her lawyers described the decision as  very disappointing   but pointed to some criticism of merrill s procedures within the lengthy judgement. the tribunal upheld ms villalba s claim of victimisation on certain specific issues  including bullying e-mails in connection with a contract  but said it found no evidence of  laddish culture  at the bank.  we said from the start that this case was about performance not gender   merrill said in a statement.  ms villalba was removed by the very same person who had promoted her into the position and who then replaced her with another woman.  merrill lynch is dedicated to creating a true meritocracy where every employee has the opportunity to advance based on their skills and hard work.   based in london s financial district  ms villalba worked for merrill s global private client business in europe  investing funds for some of merrill s most important customers. but in 2003 her employers told her she had no future after 17 years with the company  and she was made redundant. merrill lynch denied ms villalba s claims and said she was removed from her post because of the extensive losses the firm was suffering on the continent. the firm had told the tribunal that ms villalba s division had been losing about $1m a week. merrill said ms villalba lacked the leadership skills to turn around the unit.,banker lose sexism claim former execut london offic merril lynch lose £m m sex discrimin case u invest bank employ tribun dismiss stephani villalba alleg sexual discrimin unequ pay yearold claim unfair dismiss result sack august partial victori like cap compens £ tini fraction ask extent damag ass new year action big claim heard employ tribun uk view someth test case tribun decid m villalba unfairli dismiss remov senior post entitl wait see suitabl altern posit could found organis m villalba former head merril privat client busi europ make decis whether appeal spokesman lawyer describ decis disappoint point critic merril procedur within lengthi judgement tribun upheld m villalba claim victimis certain specif issu includ bulli email connect contract say found evid laddish cultur bank say start case perform gender merril say statement m villalba remov person promot posit replac anoth woman merril lynch dedic creat true meritocraci everi employe opportun advanc base skill hard work base london financi district m villalba work merril global privat client busi europ invest fund merril import custom employ told futur year compani make redund merril lynch deni m villalba claim say remov post extens loss firm suffer contin firm told tribun m villalba divis lose m week merril say m villalba lack leadership skill turn around unit
690,2109,taxes must be trusted - kennedy public trust in taxes is breaking down because labour and tories are not being straight with people on the issue  lib dem leader charles kennedy has said.  a day ahead of the government s pre-budget report  mr kennedy used a speech to say his party was facing up to  painful economic realities . he said the current level of taxation was about right  although he would put a new 50% tax on top earners. other parties have accused the lib dems of making uncosted promises. mr kennedy made it clear he was determined to counter that accusation. the lib dems have already published what they say are the full costings for all their plans and wednesday s speech did not announce new policies.  speaking at the commonwealth club  mr kennedy said it was critical for a political party to have economic credibility  both on what it promised and what it was expected to deliver. he said.  budgets have to add up. tough choices are needed in public spending.  the lib dems would cut  low priority  spending  including the government s id cards scheme and the child trust fund.  those cutbacks would free up funds for increasing basic state pensions for over-75s  putting more police on the streets and reintroducing fee eye and dental checks  he said. the lib dems argue they were honest about taxes in the past by calling for a 1p rise on income tax. now they say the only simple tax rise they want is a new 50% tax band for top earners to pay for scrapping university tuition fees  providing free personal care for elderly and disabled people and keeping local taxes down. there would also be a local income tax to replace council tax and a number of changes to environmental taxes to ensure it is the  polluter who pays .  the lib dems say the tories have only laid out possible options for cutting taxes to grab headlines while labour has hidden most of its tax rises. mr kennedy said:  that contract with the people - that the government will only tax fairly and will spend their money wisely - can only be sustained if the political parties are straightforward about their plans.  with the stealth tax strategy of gordon brown  the obvious unfairness of our current tax system - especially the council tax  and the empty promises of the conservative party on this issue - it is no wonder that trust in taxation is breaking down.  he challenged the treasury to open up its books so the national audit office can report on the government s performance.  conservative co-chairman liam fox said: liam fox said  if charles kennedy is serious about making his budgets add up he should start by explaining how they would fund their 100 spending commitments.  the reality is  the lib dems lack the courage to tackle waste and bureaucracy  and the only people who would face  tough choices  would be the families who would be £630 worse off a year.   and chancellor gordon brown said the lib dem figures did not add up. he accused the party of claiming it would spend less while across the country committing itself to spend more.,tax must trust kennedi public trust tax break labour torus straight peopl issu lib dem leader charl kennedi say day ahead govern prebudget report mr kennedi use speech say parti face pain econom realiti say current level taxat right although would put new tax top earner parti accus lib dem make uncost promis mr kennedi make clear determin counter accus lib dem alreadi publish say full cost plan wednesday speech announc new polici speak commonwealth club mr kennedi say critic polit parti econom credibl promis expect deliv say budget add tough choic need public spend lib dem would cut low prioriti spend includ govern id card scheme child trust fund cutback would free fund increas basic state pension over put polic street reintroduc fee eye dental check say lib dem argu honest tax past call p rise incom tax say simpl tax rise want new tax band top earner pay scrap univers tuition fee provid free person care elderli disabl peopl keep local tax would also local incom tax replac council tax number chang environment tax ensur pollut pay lib dem say torus laid possibl option cut tax grab headlin labour hidden tax rise mr kennedi say contract peopl govern tax fairli spend money wise sustain polit parti straightforward plan stealth tax strategi gordon brown obviou unfair current tax system especi council tax empti promis conserv parti issu wonder trust taxat break challeng treasuri open book nation audit offic report govern perform conserv cochairman liam fox say liam fox say charl kennedi seriou make budget add start explain would fund spend commit realiti lib dem lack courag tackl wast bureaucraci peopl would face tough choic would famili would £ wors year chancellor gordon brown say lib dem figur add accus parti claim would spend less across countri commit spend
691,1163,moyes u-turn on beattie dismissal everton manager david moyes will discipline striker james beattie after all for his headbutt on chelsea defender william gallas.  the scot initially defended beattie  whose dismissal put everton on the back foot in a game they ultimately lost 1-0  saying gallas overreacted. but he has had a rethink after looking over the video evidence again. he said:  i believe that i should set the record straight by conceding that the dismissal was right and correct.  moyes added:  my comments on saturday came immediately after the final whistle and at a point when i had only had the opportunity to see one  very quick re-run of the incident.   the club website also reported that beattie  who seemed unrepentant after saturday s match  insisting gallas  would have stayed down a lot longer  if he had headbutted him  has now apologised. moyes continued:  although the incident was totally out of character - james has never even been suspended before in his career - his actions were unacceptable and had a detrimental effect on his team-mates.  james did issue a formal apology to myself  his team-mates and to the everton supporters immediately after the game and that was the right thing to have done. he will now be subjected to the normal club discipline.  he is a competitive player but a fair player and i know how upset he is by what has happened. however  i must say that i do still believe the chelsea player in question did go down too easily.  speaking immediately after the game  moyes said:  i don t think it was a sending-off  i have been a centre-half in my time and i would have been ashamed to have gone down as easily as that.   not in a million years would john terry have gone down in the same way. i have never heard of anybody butting somebody from behind while you are running after them.  what has happened to big  strong centre-halves  i thought it was a push initially and i still don t think it was a sending-off.  an angry beattie initially said:  he (gallas) would have stayed down a lot longer if i had headbutted him.  i can tell you it wasn t an intentional headbutt. we were chasing a ball into the corner and william gallas was looking over his shoulder and blocking me off.  he was stopping as we were running and i said to myself  if you re going to stay in my way i ll go straight over you . our heads barely touched and it wasn t an intentional headbutt.,moy uturn beatti dismiss everton manag david moy disciplin striker jame beatti headbutt chelsea defend william galla scot initi defend beatti whose dismiss put everton back foot game ultim lose say galla overreact rethink look video evid say believ set record straight conced dismiss right correct moy ad comment saturday come immedi final whistl point opportun see one quick rerun incid club websit also report beatti seem unrepent saturday match insist galla would stay lot longer headbut apologis moy continu although incid total charact jame never even suspend career action unaccept detriment effect teammat jame issu formal apolog teammat everton support immedi game right thing do subject normal club disciplin competit player fair player know upset happen howev must say still believ chelsea player question go easili speak immedi game moy say think sendingoff centrehalf time would asham go easili million year would john terri go way never heard anybodi but somebodi behind run happen big strong centrehalv thought push initi still think sendingoff angri beatti initi say galla would stay lot longer headbut tell intent headbutt chase ball corner william galla look shoulder block stop run say go stay way go straight head bare touch intent headbutt

693,701,blunkett unveils policing plans people could be given the mobile phone number of their local bobby under an overhaul of policing in england and wales unveiled by david blunkett.  the plans include a dedicated policing team for each neighbourhood and a 10 point compulsory customer charter. the home secretary said targets would be put in place to ensure that the public got a good response from police. local people would also be able to  trigger  action on specific problems if they felt nothing was being done. local councillors would have to show certain conditions had been met before invoking the power. and police could refuse the request if the complaints were frivolous  would only cause annoyance or would pose too heavy a burden on resources.  mr blunkett said a new three digit number would be created for non-emergency phone calls to police. the best performing police services would get more cash and extra freedoms  he said  but he would not shirk from stepping in where the public was being failed. the home secretary s powers to suspend or sack chief constables are being reviewed after mr blunkett s battle with humberside chief david westwood over intelligence failures on soham murderer ian huntley.  opposition parties also want more local policing to tackle nuisance behaviour and other crime but they accuse ministers of tying the police up with paperwork. tory spokesman david davis said the proposals were  little more than a taxpayer-funded pr exercise  ahead of a general election predicted for next may.  police forces were already  buried  under existing government initiatives and there was little in the latest plans to reassure them   said mr davis. earlier lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten said the government was right to want to increase the links between local people and the police.  but these measures will only work if they re matched with a cut in the amount of paperwork - and investment in modern equipment to keep the police out on the streets.   before delivering a statement to mps  mr blunkett was joined by tony blair at welling school  in south east london  which is at the heart of a community policing initiative. mr blunkett said he wanted  to go back to a time when i was very young  when you expected the police to be part of the community and the community to be part of policing and where people were joined together in partnership making it work . the prime minister said the law-abiding citizen should be in charge of the community and  not the minority who want to cause trouble .  mr blunkett already boasts about producing record police numbers. he has also started to recruit 25 000 community support officers (csos) and the new plans would allow all police forces to give them the power to detain suspects. an extra £50m was promised on tuesday so 2 000 new csos can be recruited now rather than next year. within two years  every force will be expected to keep to a  coppers  contract  on what kind of service the public can expect. a mori poll this summer suggested policing  unlike health and education  was the one major public service where people were less satisfied the more contact they had with it. the plans also include the idea of allowing people join police forces at different levels rather than the traditional way of making everybody spend specific amounts of time as a constable before being promoted. there will also be  specific exercises  to encourage black and asian people to join the police at senior ranks.,blunkett unveil polic plan peopl could give mobil phone number local bobbi overhaul polic england wale unveil david blunkett plan includ dedic polic team neighbourhood point compulsori custom charter home secretari say target would put place ensur public get good respons polic local peopl would also abl trigger action specif problem felt noth do local councillor would show certain condit met invok power polic could refus request complaint frivol would caus annoy would pose heavi burden resourc mr blunkett say new three digit number would creat nonemerg phone call polic best perform polic servic would get cash extra freedom say would shirk step public fail home secretari power suspend sack chief constabl review mr blunkett battl humbersid chief david westwood intellig failur soham murder ian huntley opposit parti also want local polic tackl nuisanc behaviour crime accus minist tie polic paperwork torus spokesman david davi say propos littl taxpayerfund pr exercis ahead gener elect predict next may polic forc alreadi buri exist govern initi littl late plan reassur say mr davi earlier lib dem home affair spokesman mark oaten say govern right want increas link local peopl polic measur work match cut amount paperwork invest modern equip keep polic street deliv statement mp mr blunkett join toni blair well school south east london heart commun polic initi mr blunkett say want go back time young expect polic part commun commun part polic peopl join togeth partnership make work prime minist say lawabid citizen charg commun minor want caus troubl mr blunkett alreadi boast produc record polic number also start recruit commun support offic cso new plan would allow polic forc give power detain suspect extra £m promis tuesday new cso recruit rather next year within two year everi forc expect keep copper contract kind servic public expect mori poll summer suggest polic unlik health educ one major public servic peopl less satisfi contact plan also includ idea allow peopl join polic forc differ level rather tradit way make everybodi spend specif amount time constabl promot also specif exercis encourag black asian peopl join polic senior rank
694,1571,donor attacks blair-brown  feud  the reported feud between tony blair and gordon brown has prompted a labour donor to say he will almost certainly refuse to give more funds.  duncan bannatyne also attacked the government over iraq and its  poor  response to the asian tsunami crisis. his broadside came as ex-foreign secretary robin cook said he hoped mr brown would be premier at some point. mr bannatyne has previously given labour £50 000. he made his fortune from care homes and health clubs.  the 52-year-old on tuesday said was he was reviewing his donations because of cabinet disunity and international issues. his spokesman said it was highly unlikely he would give labour more money  although he would remain a supporter and not fund the conservatives.  robert peston s new book has prompted more speculation about the blair-brown rift with its claims that the prime minister broke a promise made in 2003 to stand down. mr bannatyne said:  disunity in the cabinet has a corrosive effect on the country.  gordon brown is a great chancellor who has delivered a stable economy  but business wants that to continue and not be blown off course by petty squabbles based on personal ambition.  the businessman  whose latest venture is a casino in newcastle  also voiced concern about the ongoing violence in iraq.  and he branded the uk government s response to the tsunami as  piecemeal and poor .  the people there need practical help not just pledges of money   he said.  the us has forces helping on the ground - we can do more.  british navy ships have helped the relief effort and the prime minister has said the government could ultimately give hundreds of millions of pounds in aid. mr bannatyne is due to host a new television programme and is also appearing on bbc2 business start-up programme dragon s den. but his spokesman insisted his attack on labour was not a publicity stunt.  in a separate development  robin cook gave his support to mr brown s prime ministerial ambitions but told a lunch for political journalists winning the election had to be labour s election. but he insisted the recent squabbles between mr blair and mr brown were not  perceived as a problem by the voters   adding there was no impression of governmental incompetence. mr cook argued that more prominence was given to these matters because there was  not an alternative source of opposition to the government . he warned the  abstentions party  was the real challenge to labour - and they would not be motivated by mr blair s promise to produce an  unremittingly new labour  election manifesto. his comments come after dave prentis  the leader of britain s biggest union unison  told the daily record newspaper he wants a date to be set for mr blair to be replaced as labour leader.,donor attack blairbrown feud report feud toni blair gordon brown prompt labour donor say almost certainli refus give fund duncan bannatyn also attack govern iraq poor respons asian tsunami crisi broadsid come exforeign secretari robin cook say hope mr brown would premier point mr bannatyn previous give labour £ make fortun care home health club yearold tuesday say review donat cabinet disun intern issu spokesman say highli unlik would give labour money although would remain support fund conserv robert peston new book prompt specul blairbrown rift claim prime minist broke promis make stand mr bannatyn say disun cabinet corros effect countri gordon brown great chancellor deliv stabl economi busi want continu blown cours petti squabbl base person ambit businessman whose late ventur casino newcastl also voic concern ongo violenc iraq brand uk govern respons tsunami piecem poor peopl need practic help pledg money say u forc help ground british navi ship help relief effort prime minist say govern could ultim give hundr million pound aid mr bannatyn due host new televis programm also appear bbc busi startup programm dragon den spokesman insist attack labour public stunt separ develop robin cook give support mr brown prime ministeri ambit told lunch polit journalist win elect labour elect insist recent squabbl mr blair mr brown perceiv problem voter ad impress government incompet mr cook argu promin give matter altern sourc opposit govern warn abstent parti real challeng labour would motiv mr blair promis produc unremittingli new labour elect manifesto comment come dave prenti leader britain big union unison told daili record newspap want date set mr blair replac labour leader

697,1195,giant waves damage s asia economy governments  aid agencies  insurers and travel firms are among those counting the cost of the massive earthquake and waves that hammered southern asia.  the worst-hit areas are sri lanka  india  indonesia and thailand  with at least 23 000 people killed. early estimates from the world bank put the amount of aid needed at about $5bn (£2.6bn)  similar to the cash offered central america after hurricane mitch. mitch killed about 10 000 people and caused damage of about $10bn in 1998. world bank spokesman damien milverton told the wall street journal that he expected an aid package of financing and debt relief.  tourism is a vital part of the economies of the stricken countries  providing jobs for 19 million people in the south east asian region  according to the world travel and tourism council (wttc). in the maldives islands  in the indian ocean  two-thirds of all jobs depend on tourism.  but the damage covers fishing  farming and businesses too  with hundreds of thousands of buildings and small boats destroyed by the waves. international agencies have pledged their support; most say it is impossible to gauge the extent of the damage yet. the international monetary fund (imf) has promised rapid action to help the governments of the stricken countries cope.   the imf stands ready to do its part to assist these nations with appropriate support in their time of need   said managing director rodrigo rato. only sri lanka and bangladesh currently receive imf support  while indonesia  the quake s epicentre  has recently graduated from imf assistance. it is up to governments to decide if they want imf help. other agencies  such as the asian development bank  have said that it is too early to comment on the amount of aid needed. there is no underestimating the size of the problem  however. the united nations  emergency relief coordinator  jan egeland  said that  this may be the worst national disaster in recent history because it is affecting so many heavily populated coastal areas... so many vulnerable communities.  many people will have [had] their livelihoods  their whole future destroyed in a few seconds.  he warned that  the longer term effects many be as devastating as the tidal wave or the tsunami itself  because of the risks of epidemics from polluted drinking water.  insurers are also struggling to assess the cost of the damage  but several big players believe the final bill is likely to be less than the $27bn cost of the hurricanes that battered the us earlier this year.   the region that s affected is very big so we have to check country-by-country what the situation is   said serge troeber  deputy head of the natural disasters department at swiss re  the world s second biggest reinsurance firm.  i should assume  however  that the overall dimension of insured damages is below the storm damages of the us   he said. munich re  the world s biggest reinsurer  said:  this is primarily a human tragedy. it is too early for us to state what our financial burden will be.  allianz has said it sees no significant impact on its profitability. however  a low insurance bill may simply reflect the general poverty of much of the region  rather than the level of economic devastation for those who live there.  the international federation of the red cross and red crescent societies told the reuters news agency that it was seeking $6.5m for emergency aid.   the biggest health challenges we face is the spread of waterborne diseases  particularly malaria and diarrhoea   the aid agency was quoted as saying. the european union has said it will deliver 3m euros (£2.1m; $4.1m) of aid  according to the wall street journal. the eu s humanitarian aid commissioner  louis michel  was quoted as saying that it was key to bring aid  in those vital hours and days immediately after the disaster . other countries also are reported to have pledged cash  while the us state department said it was examining what aid was needed in the region. getting companies and business up and running also may play a vital role in helping communities recover from the weekend s events.  many of the worst-hit areas  such as sri lanka  thailand s phuket island and the maldives  are popular tourist resorts that are key to local economies.  december and january are two of the busiest months for the travel in southern asia and the damage will be even more keenly felt as the industry was only just beginning to emerge from a post 9/11 slump. growth has been rapid in southeast asia  with the world tourism organisation figures showing a 45% increase in tourist revenues in the region during the first 10 months of 2004. in southern asia that expansion is 23%.  india continues to post excellent results thanks to increased promotion and product development  but also to the upsurge in business travel driven by the rapid economic development of the country   the wto said.  arrivals to other destinations such as... maldives and sri lanka also thrived.  in thailand  tourism accounts for about 6% of the country s annual gross domestic product  or about $8bn. in singapore the figure is close to 5%. tourism also brings in much needed foreign currency. in the short-term  however  travel companies are cancelling flights and trips. that has hit shares across asia and europe  with investors saying that earnings and economic growth are likely to slow.,giant wave damag asia economi govern aid agenc insur travel firm among count cost massiv earthquak wave hammer southern asia worsthit area sri lanka india indonesia thailand least peopl kill earli estim world bank put amount aid need bn £bn similar cash offer central america hurrican mitch mitch kill peopl caus damag bn world bank spokesman damien milverton told wall street journal expect aid packag financ debt relief tourism vital part economi stricken countri provid job million peopl south east asian region accord world travel tourism council wttc maldiv island indian ocean twothird job depend tourism damag cover fish farm busi hundr thousand build small boat destroy wave intern agenc pledg support say imposs gaug extent damag yet intern monetari fund imf promis rapid action help govern stricken countri cope imf stand readi part assist nation appropri support time need say manag director rodrigo rato sri lanka bangladesh current receiv imf support indonesia quak epicentr recent graduat imf assist govern decid want imf help agenc asian develop bank say earli comment amount aid need underestim size problem howev unit nation emerg relief coordin jan egeland say may bad nation disast recent histori affect mani heavili popul coastal area mani vulner commun mani peopl livelihood whole futur destroy second warn longer term effect mani devast tidal wave tsunami risk epidem pollut drink water insur also struggl ass cost damag sever big player believ final bill like less bn cost hurrican batter u earlier year region affect big check countrybycountri situat say serg troeber deputi head natur disast depart swiss world second big reinsur firm assum howev overal dimens insur damag storm damag u say munich world big reinsur say primarili human tragedi earli u state financi burden allianz say see signific impact profit howev low insur bill may simpli reflect gener poverti much region rather level econom devast live intern feder red cross red crescent societi told reuter news agenc seek m emerg aid big health challeng face spread waterborn diseas particularli malaria diarrhoea aid agenc quot say european union say deliv m euro £m m aid accord wall street journal eu humanitarian aid commission loui michel quot say key bring aid vital hour day immedi disast countri also report pledg cash u state depart say examin aid need region get compani busi run also may play vital role help commun recov weekend event mani worsthit area sri lanka thailand phuket island maldiv popular tourist resort key local economi decemb januari two busiest month travel southern asia damag even keenli felt industri begin emerg post slump growth rapid southeast asia world tourism organis figur show increas tourist revenu region first month southern asia expans india continu post excel result thank increas promot product develop also upsurg busi travel driven rapid econom develop countri wto say arriv destin maldiv sri lanka also thrive thailand tourism account countri annual gross domest product bn singapor figur close tourism also bring much need foreign currenc shortterm howev travel compani cancel flight trip hit share across asia europ investor say earn econom growth like slow

699,2035,errors  doomed first dome sale the initial attempt to sell the millennium dome failed due to a catalogue of errors  a report by the government s finance watchdog says.  the report said too many parties were involved in decision-making when the attraction first went on sale after the millennium exhibition ended. the national audit office said the dome cost taxpayers £28.7m to maintain and sell in the four years after it closed. finally  a deal to turn it into a sport and entertainment venue was struck. more than £550m could now be returned to the public sector in the wake of the deal to regenerate the site in greenwich  london.  the nao report said that this sale went through because it avoided many of the problems of the previous attempt to sell the dome. deputy prime minister john prescott said a good deal had been secured.  delivery of the many benefits secured through this deal will continue the substantial progress already made at the millennium village and elsewhere on the peninsula   he said. but edward leigh  who is chairman of the commons public accounts committee  warned the government would have to work hard to ensure taxpayers would get full benefit from the dome deal. he said:  this report also shows that the first attempt to sell the dome proved a complete fiasco. every arm of government seems to have had a finger in the pie. the process was confused and muddled.  he added:  four years after the millennium exhibition closed  the government finally has a deal to find a use for what has been a white elephant since it closed in a deal that  incredible as it may seem  should bring in some money and provide a benefit for the local area and the country as whole. however  it was more a question of luck that a strong bid turned up after thefirst abortive attempt.  nao head sir john bourn said:  in difficult circumstances following the failure of the first competition  english partnerships and the office of the deputy prime minister have worked hard to get a deal.,error doom first dome sale initi attempt sell millennium dome fail due catalogu error report govern financ watchdog say report say mani parti involv decisionmak attract first go sale millennium exhibit end nation audit offic say dome cost taxpay £m maintain sell four year close final deal turn sport entertain venu struck £m could return public sector wake deal regener site greenwich london nao report say sale go avoid mani problem previou attempt sell dome deputi prime minist john prescott say good deal secur deliveri mani benefit secur deal continu substanti progress alreadi make millennium villag elsewher peninsula say edward leigh chairman common public account committe warn govern would work hard ensur taxpay would get full benefit dome deal say report also show first attempt sell dome prove complet fiasco everi arm govern seem finger pie process confus muddl ad four year millennium exhibit close govern final deal find use white eleph sinc close deal incred may seem bring money provid benefit local area countri whole howev question luck strong bid turn thefirst abort attempt nao head sir john bourn say difficult circumst follow failur first competit english partnership offic deputi prime minist work hard get deal

for england and wales - would not change laws on assisted suicide and contains a presumption in favour of preserving life.  the bill would establish a legal presumption that everybody can make decisions about their own treatment unless proved otherwise. it would allow people to give somebody the power of attorney to make decisions on their behalf  which could be challenged by doctors. critics fear it could allow  killing by omission  through withdrawing treatment. an amendment to the bill - specifically preventing decisions that would bring about death - has been tabled by former conservative leader iain duncan smith. ninety one mps have signed a petition backing the amendment. mps could vote on it later on tuesday  during the bill s report stage debate. the bill will then go to a third reading and be debated in the lords  before becoming law.  the christian medical fellowship (cmf) and lawyers  christian fellowship (lcf) said the mental capacity bill would allow euthanasia by the  back door . peter saunders of the cmf said it believed advance refusals should be only advisory  not legally binding.  cmf is concerned that patients will make unwise and hasty advance decisions to refuse food and fluids without being properly informed about the diagnosis and the expected course their illness will take   he said.  the lcf s andrea williams said there were  too many loopholes that could be abused by unscrupulous doctors . ex-labour minister frank field told bbc two s newsnight programme there was a danger people would feel under pressure to  do away  with themselves so relatives could inherit their assets.  constitutional affairs minister david lammy said laws affecting 750 000 people with dementia needed updating. mr lammy told bbc news labour mps would not get a free vote as the law was being strengthened  not changed.  we are against euthanasia  we are against assisted suicide but we are in a situation now where people can make living wills and that has the force of the common law   he said.  doctors are saying they want more clarity. patients are saying they want more clarity.  the making decisions alliance  which includes the alzheimer s society  age concern  mencap and the national autistic society  said misunderstandings over the bill had to be cleared up.  it will not change the current law on euthanasia and will actually provide a series of better safeguards when decisions are made for people who lack capacity   the alliance said in a statement. the british medical association also backs the bill  saying it just gives incapacitated people the same rights as others. debate on legalising euthanasia has intensified in the uk because of cases like that of motor neurone patient diane pretty. she died two years ago after losing a legal battle to allow her husband to help her commit suicide.,mp debat euthanasia law mp prepar debat bill critic claim would legalis euthanasia back door bill would give legal forc live will peopl say want medic treatment withheld becom sever incapacit mental capac bill broad support chariti say would give well safeguard treatment christian group say could mean doctor withhold food fluid even think inappropri minist insist mental capac bill england wale would chang law assist suicid contain presumpt favour preserv life bill would establish legal presumpt everybodi make decis treatment unless prove otherwis would allow peopl give somebodi power attorney make decis behalf could challeng doctor critic fear could allow kill omiss withdraw treatment amend bill specif prevent decis would bring death tabl former conserv leader iain duncan smith nineti one mp sign petit back amend mp could vote later tuesday bill report stage debat bill go third read debat lord becom law christian medic fellowship cmf lawyer christian fellowship lcf say mental capac bill would allow euthanasia back door peter saunder cmf say believ advanc refus advisori legal bind cmf concern patient make unwis hasti advanc decis refus food fluid without properli inform diagnosi expect cours ill take say lcf andrea william say mani loophol could abus unscrupul doctor exlabour minist frank field told bbc two newsnight programm danger peopl would feel pressur away rel could inherit asset constitut affair minist david lammi say law affect peopl dementia need updat mr lammi told bbc news labour mp would get free vote law strengthen chang euthanasia assist suicid situat peopl make live will forc common law say doctor say want clariti patient say want clariti make decis allianc includ alzheim societi age concern mencap nation autist societi say misunderstand bill clear chang current law euthanasia actual provid seri well safeguard decis make peopl lack capac allianc say statement british medic associ also back bill say give incapacit peopl right other debat legalis euthanasia intensifi uk case like motor neuron patient dian pretti die two year ago lose legal battl allow husband help commit suicid

702,1190,call for action on internet scam phone companies are not doing enough to warn customers about internet  rogue-dialling  scams  according to premium phone line regulator icstis.  it has received 45 000 complaints in recent months about dial-up internet connections diverting to premium rate numbers without users  knowledge. phone companies refuse to pay compensation because they say calls must be paid for. they must warn people earlier about possible fraud  icstis said.  people who use dial-up connections can be affected by the scams. without realising  a program can be downloaded which diverts internet calls via a premium phone line. victims often fail to notice until they receive an unusually high bill. icstis spokesman rob dwight said:  phone companies should get in touch with their customers sooner.  if my bill goes over the usual £50 a month i want to know about it straight away - i don t want to be told when it s hit £750.   phone companies had the systems in place to spot fraudulent activity and artificially-inflated traffic  he said.  we alert them to the numbers that we have under investigation and they should be looking out for these numbers   he added.  telecoms ombudsman elizabeth france said:  certainly i would not be surprised to find my credit card company phoning me if i do something out of the ordinary.  so i would expect phone companies to be looking to see if they can have a similar approach.  the biggest phone company bt says it is doing what it can to monitor fraud and warn people about rogue dialling. its advice to customers is to use call barring if they want to prevent calls to premium lines because  under the current system  once the call has been made there s little that can be done.  gavin patterson  group managing director for bt consumer  said  we do look at customer s calling patterns and we do make interventions when they are out of the ordinary.  we re looking at the moment at whether we can improve this.  but as bt handled 180 million calls a day monitoring was  quite a task in itself   he added. the government has ordered a review of premium line services and is likely to say icstis should have more power to deal with rogue diallers in future. at the moment  it cannot demand pay-outs on the behalf of customer - it can only close illegal services down.  i use free anti-virus software (avg) and free firewall protection (zonealarm). both of these tools have prevented unauthorised access and outgoing calls inadvertently and innocently caused by my daughter s love of music sites. how about isps informing all customers of such facilities  the responsibility clearly falls with the customer but many fall prey through simply not knowing how to avoid these issues.  ignorance is and always has been an expensive business.  does any one know what happens once this fraud has been committed and recognised  the phone companies pay the people who obtaining money fraudulently  so are these people followed up and prosecuted    these diallers are mainly downloaded from sites offering illegal mp3s  porn and pirated software. if people didn t visit such sites they d be considerably less at risk. whatever happened to personal responsibility  it seems everyone has to be a  victim  these days!  part of the blame has to rest with the manufacturers of home computer operating systems. a secure system should not allow a web page or email to download and install anything without the user s knowledge.  these scams are illegal and telephone companies should have nothing to do with them. they should refuse to pay money over to the perpetrators. or are they themselves receiving such good returns that it is in their interest to keep the scam going   why don t bt et al block all premium numbers by default and only turn it off at the customer s request  to anyone who falls foul of this scam - refuse to pay your telephone provider for these calls. after you notify your telephone provider of these fraudulent transactions  they cannot insist on you paying the bill. to do so would be to knowingly assist the fraudsters to commit the fraud. no customers have yet been taken to court for refusing to pay these bills.  disable or remove your modem and use broadband instead - then you have nothing to worry about. or buy some decent firewall software and anti-virus. you would not walk out in the freezing cold without a coat - you would not drive your car without any insurance - so why not protect your pc  stop blaming the phone companies - it s not their fault!  i was very impressed with our phone company recently. i had kept ringing a hotline number for kylie tickets and next day they rang back to ask if i was aware there were 40-odd calls to the same number. great service. and i got the tickets as well!  i have a colleague who has fallen victim to this kind of scam. he informed the phone company about it  they subsequently put a block on premium rate numbers. three months later another huge bill of over £1 000 came in - the block apparently didn t work and he still has to pay for it  even though a block was in place. phone companies are probably quite happy for their customers to be hit with a huge bill  otherwise they d be taking extra steps to prevent this kind of problem.  i have been scammed of £139. the operator will do nothing about this and  to add insult to injury  i was charged vat by the government.  premium rate numbers have been subject to various scams ever since they were invented. one example was where thieves would set up a premium rate number and then dial it day and night from phones whose quarterly bills were never paid. the telephone company was the victim here and you can bet that loophole was blocked very quickly.  i know people who have run up large bills  despite being it-literate. from talking to bt in belfast  i believe that they will shortly be giving out a free application that can stop you dialling expensive numbers without knowing. it s not the fault of phone companies  and at last they are doing something about it.  it s about time that the profiteering by the  legitimate  phone companies came to an end  mainly by doing away with dial-up altogether and bring broadband down to the same price as dial-up! not only will this ruin things for the dialler scammers but also allow people to update and upgrade their security more easily and quickly.  i haven t  fallen victim to a rogue-dialling scam  but i think you re seriously remiss in not pointing out that the vast majority of these scams arise from people trying to access services purporting to provide free pornography. in most cases the user is entirely at fault  which is probably why the telephone companies are rightly unwilling to refund them.  my telephone supplier did not inform me that my monthly bill had risen from its normal £3 to £5  to £320. this was because of the scam. they simply billed me. what particularly galls me  over and above having over £300 stolen  is that the supplier and the government (through vat) are profiting from this crime and will not reimburse me their portion of my losses.  how about an automatic monthly cap of say £20 on premium rate calls that you would have to contact your provider to have lifted  that way you could use legitimate premium rate numbers while limiting fraudulent usage. at least any disputed amount would be limited  far easier for a telecoms operator to write off £20 than it is £750.  a few years back i was also the target of such scams but thank god i have already upgraded to broadband and nothing was connected to my modem so all i heard was the sound of an attempted connection.  how about home users take some responsibility and ensure their anti-virus and firewall software is up to date  that should prevent the vast majority of these scams.,call action internet scam phone compani enough warn custom internet roguedial scam accord

705,279,soaring oil  hits world economy  the soaring cost of oil has hit global economic growth  although world s major economies should weather the storm of price rises  according to the oecd.  in its latest bi-annual report  the oecd cut its growth predictions for the world s main industrialised regions. us growth would reach 4.4% in 2004  but fall to 3.3% next year from a previous estimate of 3.7%  the oecd said. however  the paris-based economics think tank said it believed the global economy could still regain momentum.  forecasts for japanese growth were also scaled back to 4.0% from 4.4% this year and 2.1% from 2.8% in 2005. but the outlook was worst for the 12-member eurozone bloc  with already sluggish growth forecasts slipping to 1.8% from 2.0% this year and 1.9% from 2.4% in 2005  the oecd said. overall  the report forecast total growth of 3.6% in 2004 for the 30 member countries of the oecd  slipping to 2.9% next year before recovering to 3.1% in 2006.  there are nonetheless good reasons to believe that despite recent oil price turbulence the world economy will regain momentum in a not-too-distant future   said jean-philippe cotis  the oecd s chief economist. the price of crude is about 50% higher than it was at the start of 2004  but down on the record high of $55.67 set in late october.  a dip in oil prices and improving jobs prospects would improve consumer confidence and spending  the oecd said.  the oil shock is not enormous by historical standards - we have seen worse in the seventies. if the oil price does not rise any further  then we think the shock can be absorbed within the next few quarters   vincent koen  a senior economist with the oecd  told the bbc s world business report.  the recovery that was underway  and has been interrupted a bit by the oil shock this year  would then regain momentum in the course of 2005.  china s booming economy and a  spectacular comeback  in japan - albeit one that has faltered in recent months - would help world economic recovery  the oecd said.  supported by strong balance sheets and high profits  the recovery of business investment should continue in north america and start in earnest in europe   it added. however  the report warned:  it remains to be seen whether continental europe will play a strong supportive role through a marked upswing of final domestic demand.  the oecd highlighted current depressed household expenditure in germany and the eurozone s over-reliance on export-led growth.,soar oil hit world economi soar cost oil hit global econom growth although world major economi weather storm price rise accord oecd late biannual report oecd cut growth predict world main industrialis region u growth would reach fall next year previou estim oecd say howev parisbas econom think tank say believ global economi could still regain momentum forecast japanes growth also scale back year outlook bad member eurozon bloc alreadi sluggish growth forecast slip year oecd say overal report forecast total growth member countri oecd slip next year recov nonetheless good reason believ despit recent oil price turbul world economi regain momentum nottoodist futur say jeanphilipp coti oecd chief economist price crude high start record high set late octob dip oil price improv job prospect would improv consum confid spend oecd say oil shock enorm histor standard see wors seventi oil price rise think shock absorb within next quarter vincent koen senior economist oecd told bbc world busi report recoveri underway interrupt bit oil shock year would regain momentum cours china boom economi spectacular comeback japan albeit one falter recent month would help world econom recoveri oecd say support strong balanc sheet high profit recoveri busi invest continu north america start earnest europ ad howev report warn remain see whether continent europ play strong support role mark upsw final domest demand oecd highlight current depress household expenditur germani eurozon overreli exportl growth
706,1122,playstation 3 processor unveiled the cell processor  which will drive sony s playstation 3  will run 10-times faster than current pc chips  its designers have said.  sony  ibm and toshiba  who have been working on the cell processor for three years  unveiled the chip on monday. it is being designed for use in graphics workstations  the new playstation console  and has been described as a supercomputer on a chip. the chip will run at speeds of greater than 4 ghz  the firms said. by comparison  rival chip maker intel s fastest processor runs at 3.8 ghz. details of the chip were released at the international solid state circuits conference in san francisco. the new processor is set to ignite a fresh battle between intel and the cell consortium over which processor sits at the centre of digital products. the playstation 3 is expected in 2006  while toshiba plans to incorporate it into high-end televisions next year. ibm has said it will sell a workstation with the chip starting later this year.  cell is comprised of several computing engines  or cores. a core based on ibm s power architecture controls eight  synergistic  processing centres. in all  they can simultaneously carry out 10 instruction sequences  compared with two for current intel chips.  later this year  intel and advanced micro devices plan to release their own  multicore  chips  which also increase the number of instructions that can be executed at once. the cell s specifications suggest the playstation 3 will offer a significant boost in graphics capabilities but analysts cautioned that not all the features in a product announcement will find their way into systems.  any new technology like this has two components   said steve kleynhans  an analyst with meta group. he said:  it has the vision of what it could be because you need the big vision to sell it.  then there s the reality of how it s really going to be used  which generally is several levels down the chain from there.   while the playstation 3 is likely to be the first mass-market product to use cell  the chip s designers have said the flexible architecture means that it would be useful for a wide range of applications  from servers to mobile phones. initial devices are unlikely to be any smaller than a games console  however  because the first version of the cell will run hot enough to need a cooling fan. and while marketing speak describes the chip as a  supercomputer  - it remains significantly slower than the slowest computer on the list of the world s top 500 supercomputers. ibm said cell was  os neutral  and would support multiple operating systems simultaneously but designers would not confirm if microsoft s windows was among those tested with the chip. if cell is to challenge intel s range of chips in the marketplace  it will need to find itself inside pcs  which predominantly run using windows.,playstat processor unveil cell processor drive soni playstat run time faster current pc chip design say soni ibm toshiba work cell processor three year unveil chip monday design use graphic workstat new playstat consol describ supercomput chip chip run speed great ghz firm say comparison rival chip maker intel fast processor run ghz detail chip releas intern solid state circuit confer san francisco new processor set ignit fresh battl intel cell consortium processor sit centr digit product playstat expect toshiba plan incorpor highend televis next year ibm say sell workstat chip start later year cell compris sever comput engin core core base ibm power architectur control eight synergist process centr simultan carri instruct sequenc compar two current intel chip later year intel advanc micro devic plan releas multicor chip also increas number instruct execut cell specif suggest playstat offer signific boost graphic capabl analyst caution featur product announc find way system new technolog like two compon say steve kleynhan analyst meta group say vision could need big vision sell realiti realli go use gener sever level chain playstat like first massmarket product use cell chip design say flexibl architectur mean would use wide rang applic server mobil phone initi devic unlik small game consol howev first version cell run hot enough need cool fan market speak describ chip supercomput remain significantli slow slowest comput list world top supercomput ibm say cell o neutral would support multipl oper system simultan design would confirm microsoft window among test chip cell challeng intel rang chip marketplac need find insid pc predominantli run use window

708,772,opposition grows to house arrests the conservatives have expressed  serious misgivings  about government plans for keeping uk and foreign terror suspects under house arrest.  michael howard said he would not back the home secretary s plans for  control orders  which include home detention.  i do not believe that anyone should be deprived of their liberty on the say so of a politician   he said. the lib dems also oppose the proposals  but ministers insist they are proportionate to the terror threat.  the government proposed the idea and a range of other new powers after the laws lords said current detentions without trial broke human rights laws. new metropolitan police commissioner sir ian blair has backed the control orders  saying:  i m sorry. it is a dilemma  but there is only one choice.  but mr howard said:  we have serious misgivings about both their effectiveness in protecting life and their consequences for the british way of life.   he argued that people accused of terrorist offences should be brought to trial and be held in prison - not at home - while they await trial. mr howard said he feared  internment without trial creates martyrs  and could be  a very effective recruiting sergeant  for terrorists . his party plans to move an amendment to the serious organised crime and police bill next week that would give a judge responsibility for assessing evidence and ensuring a balanced case is presented to the court. he called on the prime minister to  enter into constructive discussions  with his party to find a  better way forward . controversy over the issue continues after a foreign terror suspect held in the uk without trial or charge since december 2001 was freed from jail.  home secretary charles clarke said there was not enough evidence to keep the egyptian man  known only as c  certified as a terrorist suspect. on monday  the legal team for two algerian suspects being held without trial told a court the men did not want bail if it meant being put under house arrest. most of the terror suspects are detained at belmarsh prison in london. the liberal democrats say they also oppose house arrests and questioned the human rights implications of the measure. home affairs spokesman mark oaten told bbc radio 4 s today programme:  it s a matter of principle for us that we can t have a situation where the home secretary is able to impose house detention now on uk nationals as well as foreign nationals.   the lib dems believe the home secretary should allow phone tapping evidence in prosecutions.  we think there could be a role for some form of control order - tagging  surveillance  limitation on use of mobile phones - but not with the home secretary s say so. that must be done with a proper judicial process  a judge involved in making those decisions   said mr oaten. mr clarke has rejected that idea saying intercept evidence is only a small part of the case against terror suspects and could put the lives of intelligence sources at risk. he said prosecutions were the government s first preference and promised the powers would only be used in  serious  cases  with independent scrutiny from judges.,opposit grow hous arrest conserv express seriou misgiv govern plan keep uk foreign terror suspect hous arrest michael howard say would back home secretari plan control order includ home detent believ anyon depriv liberti say politician say lib dem also oppos propos minist insist proportion terror threat govern propos idea rang new power law lord say current detent without trial broke human right law new metropolitan polic commission sir ian blair back control order say sorri dilemma one choic mr howard say seriou misgiv effect protect life consequ british way life argu peopl accus terrorist offenc brought trial held prison home await trial mr howard say fear intern without trial creat martyr could effect recruit sergeant terrorist parti plan move amend seriou organis crime polic bill next week would give judg respons ass evid ensur balanc case present court call prime minist enter construct discus parti find well way forward controversi issu continu foreign terror suspect held uk without trial charg sinc decemb freed jail home secretari charl clark say enough evid keep egyptian man know c certifi terrorist suspect monday legal team two algerian suspect held without trial told court men want bail meant put hous arrest terror suspect detain belmarsh prison london liber democrat say also oppos hous arrest question human right implic measur home affair spokesman mark oaten told bbc radio today programm matter principl u situat home secretari abl impos hous detent uk nation well foreign nation lib dem believ home secretari allow phone tap evid prosecut think could role form control order tag surveil limit use mobil phone home secretari say must do proper judici process judg involv make decis say mr oaten mr clark reject idea say intercept evid small part case terror suspect could put live intellig sourc risk say prosecut govern first prefer promis power would use seriou case independ scrutini judg
709,1566,ferdinand casts doubt over glazer rio ferdinand has said he is unsure of malcolm glazer s motives after the american billionaire launched a new offer to buy manchester united.  the club have confirmed that the glazer family partnership have submitted proposals of a third bid.  a lot of people want the club s interest to be with people who have grown up with the club and have got its interests at heart   said ferdinand.  no one knows what this guy will be bringing to the table.  the central defender added on bbc radio five live:  we will have to wait and see what glazer comes with.  i would like to see the situation resolved either way.  i think people are getting bored with him coming in and out of the news with new proposals.  the other stuff off the pitch takes the shine off what is going on the pitch.   glazer  currently owns a 28.1% stake in the club  and united s statement to the stock exchange said:  the board has noted the recent press speculation on this subject.  the board can confirm that it has now received a detailed proposal subject to various pre-conditions which may form the basis of an offer for manchester united from glazer.  a further announcement will be made in due course.  glazer s previous bids for the club  which united supporters opposed  were rejected by the board because of the high level of debt they would incur. but it is believed that glazer has substantially reduced the borrowing required for his latest move. he will still need the approval of major shareholders john magnier and jp mcmanus  who own 28.9% of the club to succeed. but the irish duo have cut off talks with glazer over the proposed sale of their stake  while fans remain opposed to his involvement.,ferdinand cast doubt glazer rio ferdinand say unsur malcolm glazer motiv american billionair launch new offer buy manchest unit club confirm glazer famili partnership submit propos third bid lot peopl want club interest peopl grown club get interest heart say ferdinand one know guy bring tabl central defend ad bbc radio five live wait see glazer come would like see situat resolv either way think peopl get bore come news new propos stuff pitch take shine go pitch glazer current own stake club unit statement stock exchang say board note recent press specul subject board confirm receiv detail propos subject variou precondit may form basi offer manchest unit glazer announc make due cours glazer previou bid club unit support oppos reject board high level debt would incur believ glazer substanti reduc borrow requir late move still need approv major sharehold john magnier jp mcmanu club succeed irish duo cut talk glazer propos sale stake fan remain oppos involv
710,1640,feta cheese battle reaches court a row over whether only greece should be allowed to label its cheese feta has reached the european court of justice.  the danish and german governments are challenging a european commission ruling which said greece should have sole rights to use the name. the commission s decision gave the same legal protection to feta as to italian parma ham and french champagne. but critics of the judgement say feta is a generic term  with the cheese produced widely outside greece.  the commission s controversial 2002 ruling gave  protected designation of origin  status to feta cheese made in greece  effectively restricting the use of the feta name to producers there.  from 2007 onwards  greek firms will have the exclusive use of the feta label and producers elsewhere in europe must find another name to describe their products. the german and danish governments argue that feta does not relate to a specific geographical area and that their firms have been producing and exporting the cheese for years.  in our opinion it is a generic designation and we do not have any other name or term for this type of cheese   hans arne kristiansen  a spokesman for the danish dairy board  told the bbc. denmark is europe s second largest producer of feta after greece - producing about 30 000 tonnes a year - and exports its products to greece. it is concerned that the ruling could threaten the production of other cheeses in denmark such as brie.  it would cost millions if we wanted to introduce a new designation   mr kristiansen said.  that is just one of the costs.   the case will also have a major impact on britain s sole feta producer  yorkshire company shepherds purse cheeses.  judy bell  the company s founder  said it would cost a huge amount to rebrand its product.  if we lose we will have to go through a massive re-merchandising process and reorganisation   she said.  we have never tried to pull the wool over anyone s eyes - it s very clear from the label that it s yorkshire feta.  the original decision was a victory for greece  where feta cheese is believed to have been produced for about 6 000 years. feta is a soft white cheese made from sheep or goat s milk  and is an essential ingredient in greek cuisine. greece makes 115 000 tonnes  mainly for domestic consumption. the court is expected to reach a verdict in the case in the autumn.,feta chees battl reach court row whether greec allow label chees feta reach european court justic danish german govern challeng european commiss rule say greec sole right use name commiss decis give legal protect feta italian parma ham french champagn critic judgement say feta gener term chees produc wide outsid greec commiss controversi rule give protect design origin statu feta chees make greec effect restrict use feta name produc onward greek firm exclus use feta label produc elsewher europ must find anoth name describ product german danish govern argu feta relat specif geograph area firm produc export chees year opinion gener design name term type chees han arn kristiansen spokesman danish dairi board told bbc denmark europ second large produc feta greec produc tonn year export product greec concern rule could threaten product chees denmark brie would cost million want introduc new design mr kristiansen say one cost case also major impact britain sole feta produc yorkshir compani shepherd purs chees judi bell compani founder say would cost huge amount rebrand product lose go massiv remerchandis process reorganis say never tri pull wool anyon eye clear label yorkshir feta origin decis victori greec feta chees believ produc year feta soft white chees make sheep goat milk essenti ingredi greek cuisin greec make tonn mainli domest consumpt court expect reach verdict case autumn

713,2187,battered dollar hits another low the dollar has fallen to a new record low against the euro after data fuelled fresh concerns about the us economy.  the greenback hit $1.3516 in thin new york trade  before rallying to $1.3509. the dollar has weakened sharply since september when it traded about $1.20  amid continuing worries over the levels of the us trade and budget deficits. meanwhile  france s finance minister has said the world faced  economic catastrophe  unless the us worked with europe and asia on currency controls. herve gaymard said he would seek action on the issue at the next meeting of g7 countries in february. ministers from european and asian governments have recently called on the us to strengthen the dollar  saying the excessively high value of the euro was starting to hurt their export-driven economies.  it s absolutely essential that at the meeting of the g7 our american friends understand that we need coordinated management at the world level   said mr gaymard.  thursday s new low for the dollar came after data was released showing year-on-year sales of new homes in the us had fallen 12% in november - with some analysts saying this could indicate problems ahead for consumer activity.  commerce department data also showed consumer spending - which drives two thirds of the us economy - grew just 0.2% last month. the figure was weaker than forecast - and fell short of the 0.8% rise in october. the official us policy is that it supports a strong dollar but many market observers believe it is happy to let the dollar fall because of the boost to its exporters.  the us government has faced pressure from exporter organisations which have publicly stated the currency still has further to fall from  abnormal and dangerous heights  set in 2002. the us says it will let market forces determine the dollar s strength rather than intervene directly. statements from president bush in recent weeks highlighting his aim to cut the twin us deficits have prompted slight upturns in the currency. but while some observers said the quiet trade on thursday had exacerbated small moves in the market  most agree the underlying trend remains downwards. the dollar has now fallen for a third consecutive year and analysts are forecasting a further  albeit less dramatic weakening  in 2005.  i can see it finishing the year around $1.35 and we can see that it s going to be a steady track upward for the euro/dollar in 2005  finishing the year around $1.40   said adrian hughes  currency strategist with hsbc in london.,batter dollar hit anoth low dollar fall new record low euro data fuell fresh concern u economi greenback hit thin new york trade ralli dollar weaken sharpli sinc septemb trade amid continu worri level u trade budget deficit meanwhil franc financ minist say world face econom catastroph unless u work europ asia currenc control herv gaymard say would seek action issu next meet g countri februari minist european asian govern recent call u strengthen dollar say excess high valu euro start hurt exportdriven economi absolut essenti meet g american friend understand need coordin manag world level say mr gaymard thursday new low dollar come data releas show yearonyear sale new home u fall novemb analyst say could indic problem ahead consum activ commerc depart data also show consum spend drive two third u economi grow last month figur weaker forecast fell short rise octob offici u polici support strong dollar mani market observ believ happi let dollar fall boost export u govern face pressur export organis publicli state currenc still fall abnorm danger height set u say let market forc determin dollar strength rather interven directli statement presid bush recent week highlight aim cut twin u deficit prompt slight upturn currenc observ say quiet trade thursday exacerb small move market agre underli trend remain downward dollar fall third consecut year analyst forecast albeit less dramat weaken see finish year around see go steadi track upward eurodollar finish year around say adrian hugh currenc strategist hsbc london
714,1260,uk heading wrong way - howard tony blair has had the chance to tackle the problems facing britain and has failed  michael howard has said.   britain is heading in the wrong direction   the conservative leader said in his new year message. mr blair s government was a  bossy  interfering government that takes decisions that should be made by individuals   he added. but labour s campaign spokesman fraser kemp responded:  britain is working  don t let the tories wreck it again . mr howard also paid tribute to the nation s character for its generous response to the asian quake disaster. the catastrophe was overshadowing the hopes for the future at this usually positive time of the year  mr howard said.   we watched the scenes of destruction with a sense of disbelief. the scale  the speed  the ferocity of what happened on boxing day is difficult to grasp.  yet britain s response has shone a light on our nation s character. the last week has shown that the warm  caring heart of britain beats as strong as ever.  he went on to reflect on the values that  most britons hold dear . looking ahead to the coming general election  he pledged to  turn these beliefs into reality  and set out the choices he says are facing britain.  how much tax do people want to pay  who will give taxpayers value for money  the clean hospitals and good  disciplined schools they want   who can be trusted to get a grip on the disorder on our streets and the chaos in our immigration system    mr blair has failed to tackle these problems  he claimed  saying he has the  wrong solution  to them.   the result is big government and higher taxes eroding incentives  undermining enterprise and denying people choice.  worst of all  it is a government that has wasted people s money and failed to tackle the problems families face today.  the tories  he said  can cut crime and improve public services without asking people to pay more taxes.  we can have progress without losing what makes britain great - its tolerance  the respect for the rule of law  the ability of everyone to fulfil their potential.  we simply need to change direction. the election will give britain the chance to change.  this is the record mr blair will have to defend in the coming months  he said  urging voters to hold him to account.  but labour spokesman mr kemp said:  it would be more appropriate for this message to come out on 1 april  not 1 january.   let us never forget that when michael howard was in government britain suffered mass unemployment  15% interest rates  record home repossessions  and the introduction of the poll tax.  with labour britain is working. rather than alluding to false promises michael howard should be starting 2005 with an apology to the british people for the misery that the government  of which he was a member  inflicted upon the country.,uk head wrong way howard toni blair chanc tackl problem face britain fail michael howard say britain head wrong direct conserv leader say new year messag mr blair govern bossi interf govern take decis make individu ad labour campaign spokesman fraser kemp respond britain work let torus wreck mr howard also paid tribut nation charact gener respons asian quak disast catastroph overshadow hope futur usual posit time year mr howard say watch scene destruct sen disbelief scale speed feroc happen box day difficult grasp yet britain respons shone light nation charact last week show warm care heart britain beat strong ever go reflect valu briton hold dear look ahead come gener elect pledg turn belief realiti set choic say face britain much tax peopl want pay give taxpay valu money clean hospit good disciplin school want trust get grip disord street chao immigr system mr blair fail tackl problem claim say wrong solut result big govern high tax erod incent undermin enterpris deni peopl choic bad govern wast peopl money fail tackl problem famili face today torus say cut crime improv public servic without ask peopl pay tax progress without lose make britain great toler respect rule law abil everyon fulfil potenti simpli need chang direct elect give britain chanc chang record mr blair defend come month say urg voter hold account labour spokesman mr kemp say would appropri messag come april januari let u never forget michael howard govern britain suffer mass unemploy interest rate record home repossess introduct poll tax labour britain work rather allud fals promis michael howard start apolog british peopl miseri govern member inflict upon countri
715,1657,egypt and israel seal trade deal in a sign of a thaw in relations between egypt and israel  the two countries have signed a trade protocol with the us  allowing egyptian goods made in partnership with israeli firms free access to american markets.  the protocol  signed in cairo  will establish what are called  qualified industrial zones  in egypt. products from these zones will enjoy duty free access to the us  provided that 35% of their components are the product of israeli-egyptian cooperation. the us describes this as the most important economic agreement between egypt and israel in two decades.  the protocol establishing the zones has been stalled for years. there has been deep sensitivity in egypt about any form of co-operation with israel as long as its peace process with the palestinians remains blocked. but in recent weeks an unusual warmth has crept into relations between the two countries. both exchanged prisoners earlier this month  with egypt handing back an israeli who has served eight years in prison after being convicted for spying.  egyptian president hosni mubarak has described israeli prime minister ariel sharon as the best chance for the palestinians to achieve peace. the government in cairo now believes mr sharon is moving towards the centre and away from the positions of right wing groups. it also believes the us  pressed by europe  is now more willing to engage seriously in the search for a settlement. but there are also pressing economic reasons for egypt s decision to enter into the trade agreement. it will give a huge boost to egyptian textile exports  which are about to suffer a drop after new regulations come into force in the us at the beginning of the year.,egypt israel seal trade deal sign thaw relat egypt israel two countri sign trade protocol u allow egyptian good make partnership isra firm free access american market protocol sign cairo establish call qualifi industri zone egypt product zone enjoy duti free access u provid compon product israeliegyptian cooper u describ import econom agreement egypt israel two decad protocol establish zone stall year deep sensit egypt form cooper israel long peac process palestinian remain block recent week unusu warmth crept relat two countri exchang prison earlier month egypt hand back isra serv eight year prison convict spi egyptian presid hosni mubarak describ isra prime minist ariel sharon best chanc palestinian achiev peac govern cairo believ mr sharon move toward centr away posit right wing group also believ u press europ will engag serious search settlement also press econom reason egypt decis enter trade agreement give huge boost egyptian textil export suffer drop new regul come forc u begin year

717,2009,half of uk s mobiles  go online  multimedia mobile phones are finally showing signs of taking off  with more britons using them to go online.  figures from industry monitor  the mobile data association (mda)  show the number of phones with gprs and mms technology has doubled since last year. gprs lets people browse the web  access news services  mobile music and other applications like mobile chat. by the end of 2005  the mda predicts that 75% of all mobiles in the uk will be able to access the net via gprs. the mda say the figures for the three months up to 30 september are a  rapid increase  on the figure for the same time the previous year. about 53 million people own a mobile in the uk  so the figures mean that half of those phones use gprs. gprs is often described as 2.5g technology - 2.5 generation - sitting between 2g and 3g technology  which is like a fast  high-quality broadband internet for phones.  with more services being offered by mobile operators  people are finding more reasons to go online via their mobile. downloadable ringtones are still proving highly popular  but so is mobile chat. bandaid was the fastest ever-selling ringtone this year  according to the mda  and chat was given some publicity when prime minister tony blair answered questions through mobile text chat. multimedia messaging services also looked brighter with 32% of all mobiles in the uk able to send or receive picture messages. this is a 14% rise from last september s figures. but a recent report from continental research reflects the continuing battle mobile companies have to actually persuade people to go online and to use mms. it said that 36% of uk camera phone users had never sent a multimedia message  or mms. that was 7% more than in 2003. mobile companies are keen for people to use multimedia functions their phones  like sending mms and going online  as this generates more money for them. but critics say that mms is confusing and some mobiles are too difficult to use. there have also been some issues over interoperability  and being able to send mms form a mobile using one network to a different one.,half uk mobil go onlin multimedia mobil phone final show sign take briton use go onlin figur industri monitor mobil data associ mda show number phone gpr mm technolog doubl sinc last year gpr let peopl brow web access news servic mobil music applic like mobil chat end mda predict mobil uk abl access net via gpr mda say figur three month septemb rapid increas figur time previou year million peopl mobil uk figur mean half phone use gpr gpr often describ g technolog gener sit g g technolog like fast highqual broadband internet phone servic offer mobil oper peopl find reason go onlin via mobil download rington still prove highli popular mobil chat bandaid fast eversel rington year accord mda chat give public prime minist toni blair answer question mobil text chat multimedia messag servic also look brighter mobil uk abl send receiv pictur messag rise last septemb figur recent report continent research reflect continu battl mobil compani actual persuad peopl go onlin use mm say uk camera phone user never sent multimedia messag mm mobil compani keen peopl use multimedia function phone like send mm go onlin gener money critic say mm confus mobil difficult use also issu interoper abl send mm form mobil use one network differ one

719,756,us to rule on yukos refuge call yukos has said a us bankruptcy court will decide whether to block russia s impending auction of its main production arm on thursday.  the russian oil firm has filed for bankruptcy protection in the us in an attempt to halt the forced sale. however  judge letitia clark said the hearing would continue on thursday when arguments in the case would be heard. russian authorities are due to auction off yuganskneftegas on 19 december to pay a huge tax bill sent to yukos.  russian prosecutors are forcing the sale of the firm s most lucrative asset yuganskneftegas to help pay a $27bn (£14bn) back tax bill  which they claim is owed by yukos.  filing for bankruptcy protection in the us was  a last resort to preserve the rights of our shareholders  employees and customers   said yukos chief executive steven theede. the company added it had opted to take action through american courts as us bankruptcy law gives worldwide jurisdiction over a debtor company s property and because it was seeking a judiciary willing to protect the value of shareholders  investments. however  as the firm is based in russia and has no significant us assets  lawyers are unsure of the outcome of the case.  we are here to stop 60% of our body from being cut off on sunday   zack clement  a lawyer for yukos  told judge clark in an emergency hearing in houston  texas  on wednesday. as well as the bid to get chapter 11 bankruptcy - which protects firms from creditors  allowing them to continue trading as they restructure their finances - the group also made a claim for damages against the russian government. yukos asked the houston court to order russia to arbitration so that it can press claims for billions of dollars in damages over a  campaign of illegal  discriminatory and disproportionate  tax claims. mr clement said that under russian law  the russian government was obliged to enter into arbitration as set out in international law.  he added that the opening bid for the firm s yuganskneftgas unit was $8bn - less than half of the $20bn that yukos advisers say it is worth.  we believe the only significant bidder at the auction on sunday is gazprom   he said  referring to russia s natural gas giant. yukos maintains that the forced auction is illegal and  will cause the company to suffer immediate and irreparable harm.  many commentators believe the russian government s aggressive pursuit of yukos is a politically-motivated response to the political ambitions of its former chief executive  mikhail khodorkovsky. mr khodorkovsky  who had funded liberal opposition groups  was arrested in october last year on fraud and tax evasion charges and is still in jail analysts believe that if its production unit is auctioned off  it is likely to be bought up by a government-backed firm  like gazprom  effectively bringing a large chunk of russia s lucrative oil and gas industry back under state control.,u rule yuko refug call yuko say u bankruptci court decid whether block russia impend auction main product arm thursday russian oil firm file bankruptci protect u attempt halt forc sale howev judg letitia clark say hear would continu thursday argument case would heard russian author due auction yuganskneftega decemb pay huge tax bill sent yuko russian prosecutor forc sale firm lucr asset yuganskneftega help pay bn £bn back tax bill claim owe yuko file bankruptci protect u last resort preserv right sharehold employe custom say yuko chief execut steven theed compani ad opt take action american court u bankruptci law give worldwid jurisdict debtor compani properti seek judiciari will protect valu sharehold invest howev firm base russia signific u asset lawyer unsur outcom case stop bodi cut sunday zack clement lawyer yuko told judg clark emerg hear houston texa wednesday well bid get chapter bankruptci protect firm creditor allow continu trade restructur financ group also make claim damag russian govern yuko ask houston court order russia arbitr press claim billion dollar damag campaign illeg discriminatori disproportion tax claim mr clement say russian law russian govern oblig enter arbitr set intern law ad open bid firm yuganskneftga unit bn less half bn yuko advis say worth believ signific bidder auction sunday gazprom say refer russia natur ga giant yuko maintain forc auction illeg caus compani suffer immedi irrepar harm mani comment believ russian govern aggress pursuit yuko politicallymotiv respons polit ambit former chief execut mikhail khodorkovski mr khodorkovski fund liber opposit group arrest octob last year fraud tax evas charg still jail analyst believ product unit auction like bought governmentback firm like gazprom effect bring larg chunk russia lucr oil ga industri back state control

721,317,takeover offer for sunderland fc bob murray  chairman of sunderland fc  has launched a £1.5m ($2.8m) bid for the club after buying broadcaster bskyb s stake in the business.  mr murray is already sunderland s leading shareholder  holding a 37.6% stake  and now hopes to take full control of the championship side. mr murray said the club would find it easier to attract more investment by having a single majority owner. sunderland delisted its shares from the stock market in august.  a lifetime sunderland supporter and board director since 1984  mr murray agreed to buy bskyb s 4.76% holding in the wearside club on tuesday - taking his stake to 42.3%. under stock market rules  mr murray is required to make an offer for the remaining shares that he does not already own at the same price paid for the bskyb holding of 31p a share.  should the offer be fully accepted  mr murray said he expected to pay a maximum of £1.53m for the remaining shares. he also stressed that fans who wanted to keep in touch with the club s financial affairs could retain a small number of shares  enabling them to attend annual meetings.  the football sector is experiencing significant changes and uncertainty   mr murray said in a statement.  the recent speculation surrounding malcolm glazer and manchester united has shown the unsettling effect possible where there are a number of disparate interests   he added.  i believe that this offer will strengthen the company and remove the potential for that type of uncertainty.   sunderland were relegated from the premiership in 2003 but are currently pushing for promotion. the club managed to reduce its losses last year from £20.6m to £1.2m after selling a host of leading players. however  the club s turnover dropped sharply from £42.5m to £28.5m over the same period  because of a fall in broadcast revenues. bskyb bought its stake in sunderland in 1999 as part of a five year media partnership deal. the deal expired last month.,takeov offer sunderland fc bob murray chairman sunderland fc launch £m m bid club buy broadcast bskyb stake busi mr murray alreadi sunderland lead sharehold hold stake hope take full control championship side mr murray say club would find easy attract invest singl major owner sunderland delist share stock market august lifetim sunderland support board director sinc mr murray agre buy bskyb hold wearsid club tuesday take stake stock market rule mr murray requir make offer remain share alreadi price paid bskyb hold p share offer fulli accept mr murray say expect pay maximum £m remain share also stress fan want keep touch club financi affair could retain small number share enabl attend annual meet footbal sector experienc signific chang uncertainti mr murray say statement recent specul surround malcolm glazer manchest unit show unsettl effect possibl number dispar interest ad believ offer strengthen compani remov potenti type uncertainti sunderland releg premiership current push promot club manag reduc loss last year £m £m sell host lead player howev club turnov drop sharpli £m £m period fall broadcast revenu bskyb bought stake sunderland part five year medium partnership deal deal expir last month
722,817,india unveils anti-poverty budget india is to boost spending on primary schools and health in a budget flagged as a boost for the ordinary citizen.  india s defence budget has also been raised 7.8% to 830bn rupees ($19bn). the priority for finance minister palaniappan chidambaram is to fight poverty and keep the government s communist allies onside. but his options are limited by a new law which makes him cut the budget deficit  which he said would be 4.5% of gdp in the year to march 2005. the country s overall deficit is thought to be more than 10%  if the spending of india s 35 states and territories is included. under the fiscal responsibility law  mr chidambaram has to trim the deficit by 0.3 percentage points each year  a target he says he has now met for the current year.  but the heavy spending on poverty reduction means the 2005-6 target for the deficit will be 4.3%  mr chidambaram said - falling short of the new law s requirement.  i was left with no option but to press the pause button vis a vis the act   he said. the following year  though  would have to be back on track  he warned.   i may add that we are perilously close to the limits of fiscal prudence and there is no more room for spending beyond our means   he said. the coming year s reduction has meant bringing more of the businesses in india s burgeoning services sector into the tax system and restructuring the personal tax system  although there are numerous corporate tax and duty reductions built into the budget.  presenting his budget in the lower house of parliament  mr chidambaram said the indian economy was performing strongly and that inflation has been reined in. he said india s economy grew 6.9% in 2004. in his budget mr chidambaram has:  - increased spending on primary education to 71.56bn rupees ($1.6bn)   - increased spending on health to 102.8bn rupees ($2.35bn)   - announced that 80bn rupees ($1.8bn) will be spent on building rural infrastructure   - pledged 102.16bn rupees ($2.3bn) for tsunami victims   - increased flow of funds to agriculture by 30%   - announced a package for the sugar industry  in addition  up to 100bn rupees ($2.3bn) to be spent on infrastructure will be sourced by borrowing against the country s foreign exchange reserves  keeping budgeted spending under control.  given the resilience of the indian economy... it is possible to launch a direct assault on poverty   mr chidambaram said.  the whole purpose of democratic government is to eliminate poverty.  the new indian government  led by the congress party  was voted into power last may after it pledged to introduce economic reforms with a  human face .  the finance minister says he is committed to continue reforming india s tax system while expanding the tax base. as part of his reforms he has announced:  - duty cuts on capital goods and raw materials   - expanded service tax net   - raised the income-tax threshold to 100 000 rupees ($2 300)   - reduced income tax for those earning less than 250 000 rupees ($5 700) to 20%   - reduced corporate tax rates to 30%  an annual economic survey released on friday said india needed to ease limit restriction on foreign investment  reform labour laws and cut duties apart from widening the tax base for long-term economic growth. but mr chidambaram is under pressure from the communist parties to focus on increasing social spending. the communists are also hostile to measures seeking to increase foreign investment and allow companies to hire and fire employees at will. in recent months  they have expressed their displeasure at the government s economic reform plans including increasing foreign direct investment in telecommunication and aviation. in his last budget  mr chidambaram had pledged billions of dollars for improving education and health services for the poor as well as special assistance for farmers.,india unveil antipoverti budget india boost spend primari school health budget flag boost ordinari citizen india defenc budget also rais bn rupe bn prioriti financ minist palaniappan chidambaram fight poverti keep govern communist alli onsid option limit new law make cut budget deficit say would gdp year march countri overal deficit thought spend india state territori includ fiscal respons law mr chidambaram trim deficit percentag point year target say met current year heavi spend poverti reduct mean target deficit mr chidambaram say fall short new law requir left option press paus button vi vi act say follow year though would back track warn may add peril close limit fiscal prudenc room spend beyond mean say come year reduct meant bring busi india burgeon servic sector tax system restructur person tax system although numer corpor tax duti reduct built budget present budget low hous parliament mr chidambaram say indian economi perform strongli inflat rein say india economi grow budget mr chidambaram increas spend primari educ bn rupe bn increas spend health bn rupe bn announc bn rupe bn spent build rural infrastructur pledg bn rupe bn tsunami victim increas flow fund agricultur announc packag sugar industri addit bn rupe bn spent infrastructur sourc borrow countri foreign exchang reserv keep budget spend control give resili indian economi possibl launch direct assault poverti mr chidambaram say whole purpos democrat govern elimin poverti new indian govern lead congress parti vote power last may pledg introduc econom reform human face financ minist say commit continu reform india tax system expand tax base part reform announc duti cut capit good raw materi expand servic tax net rais incometax threshold rupe reduc incom tax earn less rupe reduc corpor tax rate annual econom survey releas friday say india need ea limit restrict foreign invest reform labour law cut duti apart widen tax base longterm econom growth mr chidambaram pressur communist parti focu increas social spend communist also hostil measur seek increas foreign invest allow compani hire fire employe recent month express displeasur govern econom reform plan includ increas foreign direct invest telecommun aviat last budget mr chidambaram pledg billion dollar improv educ health servic poor well special assist farmer

725,1805,dublin hi-tech labs to shut down dublin s hi-tech research laboratory  media labs europe  is to shut down.  the research centre  which was started by the irish government and the massachusetts institute of technology  was a hotbed for technology concepts. since its opening in 2000  the centre has developed ideas  such as implants for teeth  and also aimed to be a digital hub for start-ups in the area. the centre was supposed to be self-funded  but has failed to attract the private cash injection it needs. in a statement  media labs europe said the decision to close was taken because neither the irish government nor the prestigious us-based massachusetts institute of technology (mit) was willing to fund it. prime minister bertie ahern had wanted to the centre to become a big draw for smaller hi-tech companies  in an attempt to regenerate the area.  about three dozen small firms were attracted to the area  but it is thought the effects of the dot.com recession damaged the labs  long-term survival. the labs needed about 10 million euros (us$13 million) a year from corporate sponsors to survive.  in the end  it was too deep and too long a recession   said simon jones  the labs  managing director. ian pearson  bt s futurologist  told the bbc news website that the closure was a  real shame . bt was just one of the companies that had worked with the labs  looking at rfid tag developments and video conferencing.  there were a lot of very talented  creative people there and they came up with some great ideas that were helping to ensure greater benefits of technology for society.  i have no doubt that the individuals will be quickly snapped up by other research labs  but the synergies from them working as a team will be lost.   noel dempsey  the government s communications minister  said mr ahern had been  very committed  to the project.  he is  i know  very disappointed it has come to this. at the time it seemed to be the right thing to do   he said.  unfortunately the model is not a sustainable one in the current climate.   during its five years  innovative and some unusual ideas for technologies were developed. in recent months  14 patent applications had been filed by the labs. many concepts fed into science  engineering  and psychology as well as technology  but it is thought too few of the ideas were commercially viable in the near-term. several research teams explored how which humans could react with technologies in ways which were entirely different. the human connectedness group  for example  developed the iband  a bracelet which stored and exchanged information about you and your relationships. this information could be beamed to another wearer when two people shook hands. other projects looked at using other human senses  like touch  to interact with devoices which could be embedded in the environment  or on the body itself. one project examined how brainwaves could directly control a computer game. the labs  set up in an old guinness brewery  housed around 100 people  made up of staff  researchers  students  collaborators and part-time undergraduate students. it is thought more than 50 people will lose their jobs when the labs close on 1 february. according to its latest accounts  media lab europe said it spent 8.16 million euros (about us$10.6 million) in 2003 and raised just 2.56 million

727,1386,new drink limit  would cut toll  more lives than previously thought could be saved by cutting drink-drive limits by a third  a report says.  university college london research claims cutting the limit from 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg would save 65 lives a year. the findings are being published by the parliamentary advisory council for transport safety as mps are due to vote on the government s road safety bill. the bill includes changes to speeding fines but not to the drink-drive limit. the research  carried out by transport expert professor richard allsop  says cutting the limit would also lead to 230 fewer serious injuries on the uk s roads compared with 2003. he estimates that this would save the country £119m a year.  a previous estimate  contained in a 1998 department of transport document  suggested such a move could save 50 lives a year. the findings are based on the assumption that drivers who currently keep below the legal limit would continue to do so were it to be lowered and that those who tend to exceed the limit slightly would also lower their drinking. professor allsop said:  reducing the limit from 80mg to 50mg can be expected to save around 65 lives a year or around half of those who die in accidents where the driver s bac [blood alcohol content] is within 30mg of the current limit.  only about one in 50 of those driving during weekend evenings and nights will need to moderate their drinking to achieve this and fewer still at other times.   ministers do not support a lower limit  saying it is not clear it would have a major impact on drink drive casualties. they believe educating drivers is more important. the aa motoring trust said it was not sure what affect dropping the limit would have on drivers  attitudes to drink-driving. road safety head andrew howard said:  it remains to be seen whether the social disapproval of the drinking driver will stay at the current rate if the alcohol limit is cut.   parliamentarians need to consider this carefully. britons police themselves by consensus much more effectively than they do by weight of enforcement alone.  liberal democrat transport spokesman john thurso said drink-driving remained a  major killer   with figures showing a worrying rise in the number of accidents involving drivers who had been drinking. he said there had been a 29% drop in the number of drivers being breathalysed since 1997  which he said the government needed to address if it wanted to reduce the danger caused by drink-driving. the road safety bill  which gets its second reading on tuesday  would allow the results of roadside breath tests to be used in court - currently a blood test is needed. it also includes plans for a staggered speeding fines and points system  penalising drivers who exceed limits by a wide margin more than those who are caught going just over. these have been criticised by road safety campaigners  including labour backbencher gwyneth dunwoody  who says it will reduce the incentive for drivers to stay within the limits in residential areas  leading to more road casualties. in an article for the times newspaper  ms dunwoody  who chairs the transport select committee  says:  slight increases to low car speeds increase hugely the risks to pedestrians and cyclists.  it is quite simple: if you hit someone at 30mph  they have a 50 per cent chance of survival. if you are going at 40mph  nine times out of ten they will die.,new drink limit would cut toll live previous thought could save cut drinkdriv limit third report say univers colleg london research claim cut limit mg alcohol per ml blood mg would save live year find publish parliamentari advisori council transport safeti mp due vote govern road safeti bill bill includ chang speed fine drinkdriv limit research carri transport expert professor richard allsop say cut limit would also lead few seriou injuri uk road compar estim would save countri £m year previou estim contain depart transport document suggest move could save live year find base assumpt driver current keep legal limit would continu low tend exceed limit slightli would also low drink professor allsop say reduc limit mg mg expect save around live year around half die accid driver bac blood alcohol content within mg current limit one drive weekend even night need moder drink achiev few still time minist support low limit say clear would major impact drink drive casualti believ educ driver import aa motor trust say sure affect drop limit would driver attitud drinkdriv road safeti head andrew howard say remain see whether social disapprov drink driver stay current rate alcohol limit cut parliamentarian need consid care briton polic consensu much effect weight enforc alon liber democrat transport spokesman john thurso say drinkdriv remain major killer figur show worri rise number accid involv driver drink say drop number driver breathalys sinc say govern need address want reduc danger caus drinkdriv road safeti bill get second read tuesday would allow result roadsid breath test use court current blood test need also includ plan stagger speed fine point system penalis driver exceed limit wide margin caught go criticis road safeti campaign includ labour backbench gwyneth dunwoodi say reduc incent driver stay within limit residenti area lead road casualti articl time newspap m dunwoodi chair transport select committe say slight increas low car speed increas huge risk pedestrian cyclist quit simpl hit someon mph per cent chanc surviv go mph nine time ten die

729,1745,brown to outline presidency goals next year will be  make or break  for development in poorer countries gordon brown will say as he sets out uk goals for its eu and g8 presidencies.  the chancellor is due to outline a series of key targets the government will be judged on in 2005. they will include doubling aid from donor countries and eliminating debt owed by the poorest nations. mr brown also wants other g8 nations to match his target for overseas aid - spending 0.7% of national income.  he also wants the richer countries to do more to help the development of vaccines for aids and malaria. the chancellor is travelling to america next week as part of his persuasion drive over the issue. he told bbc radio 4 s today programme:  we need more resources allied to progress on trade and progress on debt relief if we are going to make an impact on the problems of ill health  of illiteracy  of poverty  particularly in africa but right through the developing countries.   his proposals were effectively a new  marshall plan  for the world  including an international finance facility  which would issue bonds in an attempt to double global aid cash to $100bn a year. agreement in the doha development talks could also give developing nations the trading ability they needed  he argued. the european union s common agricultural policy had caused aggravated trade problems  he said  but there was now an agreement to end export subsidies.  mr brown said much had been achieved on issues such as debt relief in the last seven years. but with 30 000 children were dying unnecessarily every day more was needed  including 100% debt relief multilaterally.  that is why next year is a test   he said.  if after five years of making promises the world is not prepared to honour them  then people will be justified in saying they promised but they did not produce results.  the catholic aid agency cafod will host mr brown s speech on wednesday.  cafod wants britain to use its influence to pressure countries like the us to make firm commitments to tackle global poverty. mr brown said america too needed to take more action but defended president george bush for guaranteeing resources to countries which introduced reforms to tackle corruption. oxfam s paying the price report this week said 45 million children will die needlessly before 2015 and aid budgets are half their 1960 levels. the charity s director  barbara stocking  said:  2005 offers the chance for an historic breakthrough  but unless world leaders act now the year will end in shameful failure.  the report said the g8 of top industrialised nations had agreed in 1970 to spend 0.7% of their incomes on aid.  but 34 years later none of the organisations members had reached this target and many had not yet set a timetable. mr blair  who has described africa as a  scar  on the world s conscience  has already said tackling world poverty would be one his g8 priorities along with climate change and the aids epidemic. but band aid founder bob geldof in july said he was sick of hearing  guff  about scars on the world. it was pathetic that britain was the 4th richest country in the world but only the 11th most generous aid donor  he added. conservative shadow international development secretary alan duncan accused mr brown of missing his target on providing anti-retroviral drug treatment to three million africans by 2005. instead  only 500 000 people would benefit  he said.  there s no point in him demanding praise and adulation for setting a whole new raft of targets when he has so woefully failed to meet the ones he already has   added mr duncan.,brown outlin presid goal next year make break develop poorer countri gordon brown say set uk goal eu g presid

730,1995,mourinho plots impressive course chelsea s win at fulham - confirming their position at the premiership summit - proves that they now have everything in place to mount serious challenges on all fronts this season.  they have got strength in depth  great players  an outstanding manager in jose mourinho and finances no other club in the world can match. all they need to add now is the big prizes which  as we all know  is the most difficult part of all. one thing is certain - they have put themselves in a position to make that leap to success very impressively indeed. they beat a very tough everton at stamford bridge  won at newcastle in the carling cup  and then won 4-1 at fulham  which was a great result given that they had been showing good form. as i said  winning the major honours is the hardest task of all  but in mourinho they have a manager who will make it a whole lot easier to handle the anticipation and expectation that will come their way now. mourinho has won the biggest club prize of all  the champions league  and that track record and confidence transmits itself to top players. it is a priceless commodity. no-one can be anything other than highly-impressed by mourinho. he is regarded as a touch arrogant by some people  and maybe he can appear that way  but he has the silverware to back up the talk. mourinho doesn t simply talk a good game - he s won some very big games such as the champions league final with porto. some may criticise his talk  but the words are backed up with actions. i ve also found him to be very realistic whenever i ve heard him. he s spent a lot of money and it seems to be working  and we should remember lots of managers have spent money and it has not worked. the buys are now integrating  and in arjen robben he has the player who is giving them that extra dimension.  in the early games he was slaughtered for defensive tactics  and yet he was winning games. you cannot win titles early on in the season  but you can certainly lose them and those points on the board were vital. i also thought the criticism was very harsh  because even though they were not scoring goals they were creating chances by the hatful. now they are taking those chances  have the double threat of robben and damien duff  and things are looking good. i just wonder if they lack a predator  particularly with didier drogba injured. he was starting to look the part before he was sidelined  but you have to feel if chelsea had a ruud van nistelrooy they would be even more of a safe bet for the title. chelsea also have all the tools to go far in the champions league. i felt they would never have a better chance than last season  but they have swept all before them in europe so far this season. it will now be very interesting to see how mourinho prioritises things  but his life will be made easier by the size of chelsea s squad. i have said i believed chelsea would win the league this season  even when arsenal were flying at the start  and i have seen nothing to make me change me mind.  if anything  what i have seen has confirmed my early impressions. and chelsea would have taken encouragement from arsenal s rocky defensive display at spurs  even though they ran out 5-4 winners. mourinho had his say on that game  complaining:  five-four is a hockey score  not a football score.  in a three-against-three training match  if the score reaches 5-4 i send the players back to the dressing rooms as they are not defending properly.  so to get a result like that in a game of 11 against 11 is disgraceful.   on a more serious note  it was a game that merely confirmed the importance of sol campbell to arsenal. much criticism has been aimed at pascal cygan  but i believe the problem lies with the absence of campbell and its overall effect on arsenal s defence. confidence is a crucial factor in defending. when you start conceding goals  you suddenly get a chill in the bones every time the ball comes into the penalty area. you think  oh no  - then find your worst fears confirmed. arsenal need to reverse the process  with or without campbell  and get some clean sheets on the board. but the return of campbell is key. he solidifies the unit  has pace and is powerful in the air and on the deck. he is vastly experienced and has a calming influence on all around him. campbell pulls it all together at the back and gets the defence playing as a unit. chelsea have no such problems at present  which is why i would still place my money on them to edge out arsenal as champions this season.,mourinho plot impress cours chelsea win fulham confirm posit premiership summit prove everyth place mount seriou challeng front season get strength depth great player outstand manag jose mourinho financ club world match need add big prize know difficult part one thing certain put posit make leap success impress inde beat tough everton stamford bridg newcastl carl cup fulham great result give show good form say win major honour hardest task mourinho manag make whole lot easy handl anticip expect come way mourinho big club prize champion leagu track record confid transmit top player priceless commod noon anyth highlyimpress mourinho regard touch arrog peopl mayb appear way silverwar back talk mourinho simpli talk good game big game champion leagu final porto may criticis talk word back action also found realist whenev heard spent lot money seem work rememb lot manag spent money work buy integr arjen robben player give extra dimens earli game slaughter defens tactic yet win game win titl earli season certainli lose point board vital also thought critic harsh even though score goal creat chanc hat take chanc doubl threat robben damien duff thing look good wonder lack predat particularli didier drogba injur start look part sidelin feel chelsea ruud van nistelrooy would even safe bet titl chelsea also tool go far champion leagu felt would never well chanc last season swept europ far season interest see mourinho prioritis thing life make easy size chelsea squad say believ chelsea would win leagu season even arsen fli start see noth make chang mind anyth see confirm earli impress chelsea would take encourag arsen rocki defens display spur even though ran winner mourinho say game complain fivefour hockey score footbal score threeagainstthre train match score reach send player back dress room defend properli get result like game disgrac seriou note game mere confirm import sol campbel arsen much critic aim pascal cygan believ problem lie absenc campbel overal effect arsen defenc confid crucial factor defend start conced goal suddenli get chill bone everi time ball come penalti area think oh find bad fear confirm arsen need revers process without campbel get clean sheet board return campbel key solidifi unit pace power air deck vastli experienc calm influenc around campbel pull togeth back get defenc play unit chelsea problem present would still place money edg arsen champion season

742,593,china  ripe  for media explosion asia is set to drive global media growth to 2008 and beyond  with china and india filling the two top spots  analysts have predicted.  japan  south korea and singapore will also be strong players  but china s demographics give it the edge  a media conference in london heard. the world s most populous country - population 1.3bn - now has about 200 million middle-class consumers. forty per cent fall in the key 16 to 35-year-old demographic. as a result  it is attracting huge foreign investment in media and communications  analysts told the financial times new media and broadcasting conference last week. interest in china among international media groups has surged in recent months after beijing issued rules allowing foreign investment in joint-venture television  radio and film production companies. news corporation  viacom and sony pictures are among the big names involved in joint ventures with chinese players.  more than 700 million chinese listen to 1 000 radio stations  while 200 tv stations broadcast 2 900 channels. china central television (cctv)  the state broadcaster  claims an audience of more than a billion people. of the country s 360 million households  100 million receive cable tv programmes. the rest could be a potential audience for satellite broadcasting which china plans to launch in 2006. the state administration of radio  film and television (sarft)  which regulates broadcasting  plans to move all programmes to digital by 2015. the continuing roll-out of new digital channels has boosted demand for quality content  creating significant opportunities for both chinese and foreign content providers.  but according to recent reports from china  the authorities have tightened controls over foreign investment in tv production joint ventures. it has limited most foreign companies to only one joint venture and banned the involvement of any found to be  unfriendly   according to reports. the sarft said:  there is a very strong ideological component to production of broadcast television programmes.  it added:  china must understand the political tendencies and background of overseas partners and prevent joint ventures or cooperation from bringing harmful foreign thinking or culture into our production sector.  according to the financial times  china correspondent  the new rules highlight the political sensitivities that surround foreign involvement in china s media sector. this is despite beijing s decision to open the state-dominated sector to international investment.  as well as traditional broadcasting  chinese and foreign entrepreneurs alike see fortunes waiting to be made in new media  like mobile services and online gaming. mobile games already account for 15% of revenues from china s 340 million mobile users.  online gaming sales are predicted to top a billion us dollars next year  according to the uk-based journal screen digest. the video market is also seen as a big opportunity  although piracy levels are still very high despite an anti-piracy drive during the past year. in the cinema industry the deployment of digital screens is being accelerated. this is not just to modernise venues but also to curb piracy and regulate distribution. li ruigang  president of the commercial broadcaster shanghai media group  told the conference that china s new media market  is already experiencing explosive growth . it was particularly strong in charged broadband services and mobile value-added services. leading china-watcher  and founder of the cga consultancy jeanne-marie gescher  agreed that the time was ripe for foreign media groups to tap china s huge media market potential.  china s media are now driven by investors who do not care how people consume media -

743,1835,school sport  is back   says pm tony blair has promised that  sport is back  as a priority for schools.  the prime minister launched a £500m initiative to allow school sports clubs in england to provide up to three hours of extra activity a week by 2010.  it s an important part of education and it s an important part of health   mr blair said. but the conservatives say government proposals - which include two hours  pe within school for 75% of pupils by 2006 - are unrealistic.  the latest move is aimed at encouraging more diversity in sport  with activities such as yoga and tai chi being options. launching the initiative  mr blair completed an agility course and shot basketball hoops with students from the all-girl waverley sports college in southwark  south london. he said:  you ve got to bring back school sport. it s got to be done differently than it was 30 or 40 years ago. it s still very  very important.   earlier  education secretary charles clarke told bbc news there were at least three areas which needed  a coherent framework  and  dedicated funding . these were training for pe teachers  establishing more specialist schools and the development of partnerships for activities such as inter-school competitions. he added the government had originally pledged  for every pupil to get at least two hours of high-quality physical education  a week. the proportion was currently at 62%  and the government was hoping this would rise to 85% by 2008 and 100% by 2010. the money for the initiative will come from a new £500m fund.  the £500m move will also increase the number of specialist sport colleges from 350 to 400. but the conservatives warned of rising obesity levels and said that since only a third of children do two hours of sport a week currently  the government is promising something it cannot guarantee. shadow spokesman for sport hugh robertson said:  i suspect the correct way to tackle it is to look at the other end of the spectrum and try to enable the clubs - which is where the real passion for sport exists - to deliver the school sport offer.  he said more emphasis should be put on traditional sports  saying that an  anti-competitive sport agenda  had been pursued in recent years. martin ward  of the secondary heads association  said members did not like  ring-fenced funds  and that it should be up to the schools themselves to decide how to spend their money.,school sport back say pm toni blair promis sport back prioriti school prime minist launch £m initi allow school sport club england provid three hour extra activ week import part educ import part health mr blair say conserv say govern propos includ two hour pe within school pupil unrealist late move aim encourag diver sport activ yoga tai chi option launch initi mr blair complet agil cours shot basketbal hoop student allgirl waverley sport colleg southwark south london say get bring back school sport get do differ year ago still import earlier educ secretari charl clark told bbc news least three area need coher framework dedic fund train pe teacher establish specialist school develop partnership activ interschool competit ad govern origin pledg everi pupil get least two hour highqual physic educ week proport current govern hope would rise money initi come new £m fund £m move also increas number specialist sport colleg conserv warn rise obes level say sinc third child two hour sport week current govern promis someth guarante shadow spokesman sport hugh robertson say suspect correct way tackl look end spectrum tri enabl club real passion sport exist deliv school sport offer say emphasi put tradit sport say anticompetit sport agenda pursu recent year martin ward secondari head associ say member like ringfenc fund school decid spend money

745,1202,parmalat sues 45 banks over crash parmalat has sued 45 banks as it tries to reclaim money paid to banks before the scandal-hit italian dairy company went bust last year.  the firm collapsed with debts of about 14bn euros ($19bn; £10bn) and new boss enrico bondi has already taken legal action against a number of lenders. he claims the banks were aware of the problems but continued to work with the company so they could earn commissions. parmalat has not identified which banks it has gone after this time. under italian law  administrators can seek to get back money paid to financial institutions prior to insolvency  if there is a suspicion that the institutions knew that the company was in financial trouble. the firm also said it is preparing further law suits.  according to the reuters news agency  35 of the companies sued on thursday are italian while the remaining 10 are international. the unidentified parmalat source also told reuters that the company was planning to take action against a total of 80 financial institutions. among those already targeted are bank of america  ubs  credit suisse first boston  deutsche bank and citigroup. it has also gone after auditors grant thornton. they have all denied any wrongdoing. parmalat was declared insolvent in december 2003 after it emerged that 4bn euros thought to be held in an offshore account did not in fact exist. in the investigation that followed it became apparent that the company  among other things  had been billing clients twice in order to boost sales and bolster the balance sheet. that enabled parmalat to borrow heavily and expand overseas  allowing it to become a darling of the italian stock exchange.,parmalat sue bank crash parmalat su bank tri reclaim money paid bank scandalhit italian dairi compani go bust last year firm collaps debt bn euro bn £bn new bos enrico bondi alreadi take legal action number lender claim bank awar problem continu work compani could earn commiss parmalat identifi bank go time italian law administr seek get back money paid financi institut prior insolv suspicion institut knew compani financi troubl firm also say prepar law suit accord reuter news agenc compani su thursday italian remain intern unidentifi parmalat sourc also told reuter compani plan take action total financi institut among alreadi target bank america ub credit suiss first boston deutsch bank citigroup also go auditor grant thornton deni wrongdo parmalat declar insolv decemb emerg bn euro thought held offshor account fact exist investig follow becam appar compani among thing bill client twice order boost sale bolster balanc sheet enabl parmalat borrow heavili expand oversea allow becom darl italian stock exchang

747,917,enron bosses in $168m payout eighteen former enron directors have agreed a $168m (£89m) settlement deal in a shareholder lawsuit over the collapse of the energy firm.  leading plaintiff  the university of california  announced the news  adding that 10 of the former directors will pay $13m from their own pockets. the settlement will be put to the courts for approval next week. enron went bankrupt in 2001 after it emerged it had hidden hundreds of millions of dollars in debt.  before its collapse  the firm was the seventh biggest public us company by revenue. its demise sent shockwaves through financial markets and dented investor confidence in corporate america.   the settlement is very significant in holding these outside directors at least partially personally responsible   william lerach  the lawyer leading the class action suit against enron  said.  hopefully  this will help send a message to corporate boardrooms of the importance of directors performing their legal duties   he added. under the terms of the $168m settlement - $155m of which will be covered by insurance - none of the 18 former directors will admit any wrongdoing. the deal is the fourth major settlement negotiated by lawyers who filed a class action on behalf of enron s shareholders almost three years ago. so far  including the latest deal  just under $500m (£378.8m) has been retrieved for investors.  however  the latest deal does not include former enron chief executives ken lay and jeff skilling. both men are facing criminal charges for their alleged misconduct in the run up to the firm s collapse. neither does it cover andrew fastow  who has pleaded guilty to taking part in an illegal conspiracy while he was chief financial officer at the group. enron s shareholders are still seeking damages from a long list of other big name defendants including the financial institutions jp morgan chase  citigroup  merrill lynch and credit suisse first boston. the university of california said the trial in the case is scheduled to begin in october 2006. it joined the lawsuit in december 2001alleging  massive insider trading  and fraud  claiming it had lost $145m on its investments in the company.,enron bos m payout eighteen former enron director agre m £m settlement deal sharehold lawsuit collaps energi firm lead plaintiff univers california announc news ad former director pay m pocket settlement put court approv next week enron go bankrupt emerg hidden hundr million dollar debt collaps firm seventh big public u compani revenu demis sent shockwav financi market dent investor confid corpor america settlement signific hold outsid director least partial person respons william lerach lawyer lead class action suit enron say hope help send messag corpor boardroom import director perform legal duti ad term m settlement m cover insur none former director admit wrongdo deal fourth major settlement negoti lawyer file class action behalf enron sharehold almost three year ago far includ late deal m £m retriev investor howev late deal includ former enron chief execut ken lay jeff skill men face crimin charg alleg misconduct run firm collaps neither cover andrew fastow plead guilti take part illeg conspiraci chief financi offic group enron sharehold still seek damag long list big name defend includ financi institut jp morgan chase citigroup merril lynch credit suiss first boston univers california say trial case schedul begin octob join lawsuit decemb alleg massiv insid trade fraud claim lose m invest compani
748,1327,wenger keeping faith with almunia arsene wenger has pledged to keep faith with stand-in keeper manuel almunia for the crunch week which could define arsenal s season.  almunia will start tuesday s champions league group tie against rosenborg and is likely to face chelsea on sunday. wenger said:  you don t think i would take out one goalkeeper for just one game  do you  i don t do that.  i have to give him a run for a few games. it s just that i don t want to make this story bigger than it is.  wenger insists he has complete faith in the 27-year-old spaniard  who was signed last summer from celta vigo as back-up to jens lehmann.   if you look at my career  you will see that i have left many big players out for a long time. i ve done it with dennis bergkamp  kanu  everybody.  it s because it s a goalkeeper  that s all. it s a usual situation for me. you put your best team out  no matter who it is.  for me  it was not a big mistake at old trafford and i wasn t alarmed by what happened against birmingham either.  it s nothing against lehmann. i think he s a great keeper  as is almunia. you can only play one of them.  these people are not robots - they have good periods and less good periods. just because lehmann doesn t play for two or three weeks  or longer or shorter  it doesn t mean i ve lost faith in him.   but former arsenal keeper david seaman believes lehmann has been harshly treated. seaman told the daily mail:  jens is a fantastic keeper. he deserves another chance.  he has made a few mistakes but on form he deserves to be the first-team choice.  with arsenal hit by injuries and suspension  inexperienced midfield pair of mathieu flamini and cesc fabregas will line up against rosenborg but wenger is confident they will prove more than capable.  it puts a lot of pressure on them but it s a good learning process   said wenger.  i m not worried as they are both mentally strong and will put in the needed workrate.   the gunners go into the game boosted by the news that defender sol campbell is on the verge of signing a new deal with the club. and the 30-year-old  whose current contract runs out in the summer  has made it clear he is determined to achieve champions league success with arsenal. campbell said:  it means a lot to me to go through  it s everything. we want to carry on in this competition.  that s where the best teams in europe are. to be in there  playing against these guys and trying to win the trophy  is the first thing in my mind.   meanwhile  thierry henry believes he will be blamed if arsenal fail to qualify for the next stage of the champions league. henry will captain the side in place of the suspended patrick vieira as the gunners seek the required victory over rosenborg. and the striker said:  if we don t win and we go out of the competition  like it or not  it s going to be my fault. that s the way it is.  if the team don t win i know i will be criticised  no matter how i play.,wenger keep faith almunia arsen wenger pledg keep faith standin keeper manuel almunia crunch week could defin arsen season almunia start tuesday champion leagu group tie rosenborg like face chelsea sunday wenger say think would take one goalkeep one game give run game want make stori big wenger insist complet faith yearold spaniard sign last summer celta vigo backup jen lehmann look career see left mani big player long time do denni bergkamp kanu everybodi goalkeep usual situat put best team matter big mistak old trafford alarm happen birmingham either noth lehmann think great keeper almunia play one peopl robot good period less good period lehmann play two three week longer shorter mean lose faith former arsen keeper david seaman believ lehmann harshli treat seaman told daili mail jen fantast keeper deserv anoth chanc make mistak form deserv firstteam choic arsen hit injuri suspens inexperienc midfield pair mathieu flamini cesc fabrega line rosenborg wenger confid prove capabl put lot pressur good learn process say wenger worri mental strong put need workrat gunner go game boost news defend sol campbel verg sign new deal club yearold whose current contract run summer make clear determin achiev champion leagu success arsen campbel say mean lot go everyth want carri competit best team europ play guy tri win trophi first thing mind meanwhil thierri henri believ blame arsen fail qualifi next stage champion leagu henri captain side place suspend patrick vieira gunner seek requir victori rosenborg striker say win go competit like go fault way team win know criticis matter play

752,165,ukip candidate suspended eurosceptic party ukip have suspended a candidate for allegedly suggesting the criminally insane should be killed.  john houston  54  was due to stand in the east kilbride seat in lanarkshire at the next election. but he was suspended after his reported views  including the return of the british empire  were sent to two scottish newspapers. ukip spokesman mark croucher said those who selected mr houston knew nothing of his views. the episode comes at a difficult time for ukip  soon after the high-profile departure of mep robert kilroy-silk. mr houston is alleged to have said that the organs of the criminally insane should be  made available to law-abiding members of the community  and proposed the legalisation of drugs and the sex trade. the document reportedly said:  we re looking for the resurrection of the british empire.  the problems for the human race - environmental and others - can only be dealt with on a global scale  and that calls for a radical alliance of the english-speaking nations  which they are uniquely able to do.  mr croucher said the main issue would be that mr houston s reported views had been presented as ukip policy  which they were not. he said they might have been submissions to a committee working on the party s manifesto  but would not have been matched to mr houston when he was standing to become a candidate. he told bbc news:  he appears to have said these things. we have suspended him as a member and as a candidate.  by all accounts none of this was mentioned at his selection meeting.  it is simply a distraction from the task in hand  the eu constitution  not individual idiocies.  mr houston was quoted in the herald newspaper saying:  i feel ukip have over-reacted and overshot the runway.   peter nielson  who is ukip scotland chairman  said he had suspended mr houston on friday night.  he will remain suspended while the matter is being investigated and then we will decide if and what further action will be taken.  he said that any evidence would be looked into and mr houston may be interviewed by the party. he added:  i can t comment too much at the moment  i have one version from him but i haven t seen the papers yet.,ukip candid suspend euroscept parti ukip suspend candid allegedli suggest crimin insan kill john houston due stand east kilbrid seat lanarkshir next elect suspend report view includ return british empir sent two scottish newspap ukip spokesman mark croucher say select mr houston knew noth view episod come difficult time ukip soon highprofil departur mep robert kilroysilk mr houston alleg say organ crimin insan make avail lawabid member commun propos legalis drug sex trade document reportedli say look resurrect british empir problem human race environment other dealt global scale call radic allianc englishspeak nation uniqu abl mr croucher say main issu would mr houston report view present ukip polici say might submiss committe work parti manifesto would match mr houston stand becom candid told bbc news appear say thing suspend member candid account none mention select meet simpli distract task hand eu constitut individu idioci mr houston quot herald newspap say feel ukip overreact overshot runway peter nielson ukip scotland chairman say suspend mr houston friday night remain suspend matter investig decid action take say evid would look mr houston may interview parti ad comment much moment one version see paper yet
753,1847,blind student  hears in colour  a blind student has developed software that turns colours into musical notes so that he can read weather maps.  victor wong  a graduate student from hong kong studying at cornell university in new york state  had to read coloured maps of the upper atmosphere as part of his research. to study  space weather  mr wong needed to explore minute fluctuations in order to create mathematical models. a number of solutions were tried  including having a colleague describe the maps and attempting to print them in braille. mr wong eventually hit upon the idea of translating individual colours into music  and enlisted the help of a computer graphics specialist and another student to do the programming work.   the images have three dimensions and i had to find a way of reading them myself   mr wong told the bbc news website.  for the sake of my own study - and for the sake of blind scientists generally - i felt it would be good to develop software that could help us to read colour images.  he tried a prototype version of the software to explore a photograph of a parrot. in order to have an exact reference to the screen  a pen and tablet device is used. the software then assigns one of 88 piano notes to individually coloured pixels - ranging from blue at the lower end of this scale to red at the upper end. mr wong says the application is still very much in its infancy and is only useful for reading images that have been created digitally.  if i took a random picture and scanned it and then used my software to recognise it  it wouldn t work that well.   mr wong has been blind from the age of seven and he thinks that having a  colour memory  makes the software more useful than it would be to a scientist who had never had any vision.  as the notes increase in pitch i know the colour s getting redder and redder  and in my mind s eye a patch of red appears.  the colour to music software has not yet been made available commercially  and mr wong believes that several people would have to work together to make it viable. but he hopes that one day it can be developed to give blind people access to photographs and other images.,blind student hear colour blind student develop softwar turn colour music note read weather map victor wong graduat student hong kong studi cornel univers new york state read colour map upper atmospher part research studi space weather mr wong need explor minut fluctuat order creat mathemat model number solut tri includ colleagu describ map attempt print braill mr wong eventu hit upon idea translat individu colour music enlist help comput graphic specialist anoth student program work imag three dimens find way read mr wong told bbc news websit sake studi sake blind scientist gener felt would good develop softwar could help u read colour imag tri prototyp version softwar explor photograph parrot order exact refer screen pen tablet devic use softwar assign one piano note individu colour pixel rang blue low end scale red upper end mr wong say applic still much infanc use read imag creat digit take random pictur scan use softwar recognis work well mr wong blind age seven think colour memori make softwar use would scientist never vision note increas pitch know colour get redder redder mind eye patch red appear colour music softwar yet make avail commerci mr wong believ sever peopl would work togeth make viabl hope one day develop give blind peopl access photograph imag

755,1667,games help you  learn and play   god games  in which players must control virtual people and societies could be educational  says research.  a us researcher has suggested that games such as the sims could be a good way to teach languages. ravi purushotma believes that the world of the sims can do a better job of teaching vocabulary and grammar than traditional methods. the inherent fun of game playing could help to make learning languages much less of a chore  said mr purushotma.  there must be few parents or teachers that do not worry that the lure of a video game on a computer or console is hard to resist by children that really should be doing their homework. but instead of fearing computer games  ravi purushotma believes that educationalists  particularly language teachers should embrace games.  one goal would be to break what i believe to be the false assumption that learning and play are inherently oppositional   he said. he believes that the  phenomenal ability  of games such as the sims and others to capture the interest of adolescent audiences is ripe for exploitation. the hard part of learning any language  said mr purushotma  were the basic parts of learning what different words refer to and how they are used to build up sentences. boring lessons drumming vocabulary into pupils couched in terms they do not understand has made many languages far harder to learn than they should be.  the way we often teach foreign languages right now is somewhat akin to learning to ride a bike by formally studying gravity   he said.  by contrast  said mr purushotma  learning via something like the sims may mean students do not feel like they are studying at all. this was because the sims does not rely solely on words to get information across to players. instead the actions of its computer controlled people and how they interact with their world often makes clear what is going on. the incidental information about what a sim was doing could reinforce what a player or student was supposed to be learning  said mr purushotma. by contrast many language lessons try to impart information about a tongue with little context. for instance  he said  in a version of the sims adapted to teach german  if a player misunderstood what was meant by the word  energie  the actions of a tired sim  stumbling then falling asleep  would illustrate the meaning. if necessary detailed textual information could be called upon to aid players  or students  understanding.  one of the drawbacks of the sims  said mr purushotma  was the lack of spoken language to help people brush up on pronunciation. however  online versions of the sims  in which people have to move in  meet the neighbours and get to know the local town  could be adapted to help this. although not wishing to claim that he is the first to suggest using a game can help people learn  mr purushotma believes that educationalists have missed the potential they have to help.  getting a simulated person to perform everyday activities in a make-believe world and having them described in a foreign language could be a powerful learning aid  he believes. before now  he said  educational software titles suffer by comparison with the slick graphics and rich worlds found in games. but  he said  using pre-prepared game worlds such as the sims has never been easier because tools have been made by its creators and fans that make it easy to modify almost any part of the game. this could make it easy for teachers to adapt parts of the game for their own lessons.  i m hoping now to re-create a well-polished german learning mod for the sequel by this summer   he told the bbc news website.  i m encouraged to hear that others are thinking of experimenting with japanese and spanish.  earlier work with a colleague on using civilisation iii to teach students about history showed that it could be a powerful way to get them to realise that solving a society s problems can not always come from making a single change. a report on the experiment said:  students began asking historical and geographical questions in the context of game play  using geography and history as tools for their game  and drawing inferences about social phenomena based on their play.  mr purushotma s ideas were aired in an article for the journal language learning and technology.,game help learn play god game

765,1114,satellite mapping aids darfur relief aid workers trying to house  feed and clothe millions of homeless refugees in the sudanese region of darfur are getting a helping hand from advanced mapping technology.  a european consortium of companies and university groups known as respond is working to provide accurate and up to date maps. the aim is to overcome some of the huge logistical challenges in getting supplies to where they are needed. respond is using satellite imagery to produce accurate maps that can be used in the field rapidly.  respond has produced very detailed maps for example for the road networks  for the rivers and for the villages  to more large-scale maps useful for very general planning purposes   said einar bjorgo from unosat  the un satellite mapping organisation that is part of the respond consortium.  the group uses satellites from nasa  the european space agency and the disaster monitoring constellation. the satellite data is transmitted to ground stations. from there  the information makes its way to respond organisations that specialise in interpreting such data.  you have to convert the data into images  then the interpreter has to convert all this into crisis  damage  or situation maps   said stefan voigt  who works in the remote sensing department of one of those organisations  the german aerospace centre.  this kind of detailed analysis usually takes a couple of months but respond gets it done in about 12 hours.  our users are usually not so much familiar with reading satellite imagery  reading satellite maps  so it s our task to transfer the data into information that non-technical people can read and understand easily and very  very efficiently   said mr voigt. respond supplies maps to aid groups via the web  and on compact disc. but the best map is one you can hold in your hands  especially in remote areas where internet connections and laptops are scarce.  a map is a working document   explains herbert hansen of respond s belgian partner keyobs.  you need to use it  you need to write on it  correct  give feedback and so on  so you need paper to write on.  we print maps  we laminate the maps  we encapsulate the maps if needed so you can take a shower with the map  it s completely protected.   humanitarian groups in darfur have been making good use of respond s maps. they have come in especially handy during sudan s rainy season  when normally dry riverbeds  or wadis  became flooded.  these wadis had a very small amount of flooding  generally  in terms of depth  but greatly impeded the transport capabilities and capacities of the humanitarian groups on the ground   says stephen candillon of respond imaging partner sertit. respond s rapid imaging has allowed aid groups to find ways around the wadis  allowing then to mark on their maps which roads were washed out at which times. aid groups say that combination of satellite technology and on-the-ground observation helped keep relief flowing to those who needed it.  clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world  a bbc world service and wgbh-boston co-production,satellit map aid darfur relief aid worker tri hous feed cloth million homeless refuge sudanes region darfur get help hand advanc map technolog european consortium compani univers group know respond work provid accur date map aim overcom huge logist challeng get suppli need respond use satellit imageri produc accur map use field rapidli respond produc detail map exampl road network river villag largescal map use gener plan purpos say einar bjorgo unosat un satellit map organis part respond consortium group use satellit nasa european space agenc disast monitor constel satellit data transmit ground station inform make way respond organis specialis interpret data convert data imag interpret convert crisi damag situat map say stefan voigt work remot sen depart one organis german aerospac centr kind detail analysi usual take coupl month respond get do hour user usual much familiar read satellit imageri read satellit map task transfer data inform nontechn peopl read understand easili effici say mr voigt respond suppli map aid group via web compact disc best map one hold hand especi remot area internet connect laptop scarc map work document explain herbert hansen respond belgian partner keyob need use need write correct give feedback need paper write print map lamin map encapsul map need take shower map complet protect humanitarian group darfur make good use respond map come especi handi sudan raini season normal dri riverb wadi becam flood wadi small amount flood gener term depth greatli imped transport capabl capac humanitarian group ground say stephen candillon respond imag partner sertit respond rapid imag allow aid group find way around wadi allow mark map road wash time aid group say combin satellit technolog ontheground observ help keep relief flow need clark boyd technolog correspond world bbc world servic wgbhboston coproduct
766,2188,jones files conte lawsuit marion jones has filed a lawsuit for defamation against balco boss victor conte following his allegations that he gave her performance-enhancing drugs.  the sydney olympic gold medallist says conte damaged her reputation and she is seeking $25m (£13m) in the suit. conte  whose company is at the centre of a doping investigation  made the claims in a us television programme. he and three others were indicted in february by a federal grand jury for a variety of alleged offences. in an email to the associated press on wednesday  conte said:  i stand by everything i said . jones won three gold medals and two bronzes in sydney in 2000. her lawsuit  filed in the us district court in san francisco  said the sprinter had passed a lie detector test and that she  has never taken banned performance-enhancing drugs . conte s statements  the suit added  were  false and malicious . after the abc television program earlier this month  jones  lawyer richard nicholls said:  marion has steadfastly maintained her position throughout: she has never  ever used performance-enhancing drugs.  victor conte is a man facing a 42-count federal indictment  while marion jones is one of america s most decorated female athletes. mr conte s statements have been wildly contradictory.  mr conte chose to make unsubstantiated allegations on television  while marion jones demanded to take and then passed a lie detector examination.   mr conte is simply not credible. we challenge him to submit to the same lie detector procedure that marion jones passed.  the sport s ruling body  the iaaf  is taking a cautious approach to conte s allegations but contacted the us anti-doping agency. communications director nick davies said the iaaf would seek to contact conte  for further information . but davies stressed it would be up to the american authorities to decide whether they will take action against jones in light of conte s television interview and the world governing body would monitor the situation closely.  if it is felt there is case to answer  it would be for its national governing body (usa track and field) to take the appropriate disciplinary action   he added.  the us anti-doping agency has proved itself to be very diligent in its anti-doping war.  and i am sure  like ourselves  they will be watching the television programme with great interest.  jones  who is under investigation for steroid use by the us anti-doping agency  has continually denied ever taking illegal substances since being investigated in the balco scandal  although she praised a zinc supplement conte marketed. jones  who did not win any medals in athens in august  has never failed a drugs test. meanwhile  conte  who has been charged along with three other men of distributing illegal steroids and money laundering  is due to face trial in march.,jone file cont lawsuit marion jone file lawsuit defam balco bos victor cont follow alleg give performanceenhanc drug sydney olymp gold medallist say cont damag reput seek m £m suit cont whose compani centr dope investig make claim u televis programm three other indict februari feder grand juri varieti alleg offenc email associ press wednesday cont say stand everyth say jone three gold medal two bronz sydney lawsuit file u district court san francisco say sprinter pas lie detector test never take ban performanceenhanc drug cont statement suit ad fals malici abc televis program earlier month jone lawyer richard nichol say marion steadfastli maintain posit throughout never ever use performanceenhanc drug victor cont man face count feder indict marion jone one america decor femal athlet mr cont statement wildli contradictori mr cont chose make unsubstanti alleg televis marion jone demand take pas lie detector examin mr cont simpli credibl challeng submit lie detector procedur marion jone pas sport rule bodi iaaf take cautiou approach cont alleg contact u antidop agenc commun director nick davi say iaaf would seek contact cont inform davi stress would american author decid whether take action jone light cont televis interview world govern bodi would monitor situat close felt case answer would nation govern bodi usa track field take appropri disciplinari action ad u antidop agenc prove dilig antidop war sure like watch televis programm great interest jone investig steroid use u antidop agenc continu deni ever take illeg substanc sinc investig balco scandal although prais zinc supplement cont market jone win medal athen august never fail drug test meanwhil cont charg along three men distribut illeg steroid money launder due face trial march

770,877,anglers  could face prosecution  anglers and fishermen could find themselves prosecuted under plans to crack down on animal cruelty  a committee of mps has warned.  sloppy wording of the draft animal welfare bill could leave anglers facing court even though it was not intended  the environment select committee said. the mps said they were  concerned  the government had not consulted directly on its plans to improve animal welfare. they raised complex and emotive issues which needed to be resolved  mps said.  they called for a  cast-iron guarantee  that the government consults on any plans to regulate animal industries like pet fairs and game bird rearing. the draft bill seeks to modernise and improve animal welfare legislation  and intends to protect  kept animals  and  companion  animals by setting up a  duty of care . in addition to maintaining existing cruelty offences  it creates an offence of neglect by keepers who fail to protect the animals for whom they are responsible. the bill would allow animal welfare officers to intervene to prevent harm to an animal as well as outlawing  mutilation  of animals - unless it can be demonstrated to be in the animal s best interest.  the environment select committee made 101 recommendations after hearing evidence from 51 organisations and individuals. one was a call to amend the bill so that prosecutions against those engaged in fishing were not inadvertently encouraged - even if they were to later fail.  we accept that neither commercial fishing nor recreational angling should fall within the remit of the of the draft bill and we therefore support the government s intention to exempt fishing as an activity.   but the committee said an amendment was needed to ensure cases were not brought.  however  in exempting fishing  the government should be careful to ensure that those persons who catch fish are not given  carte blanche  to inflict unnecessary suffering in the course of pursuing this activity   the committee added. the committee also said some legal protections for animals were downgraded by the bill  such as the law on abandonment of animals which  would be significantly weakened . mps urged the government to redraft clauses relating to the prosecution of cruelty offences. this was because as it stood the draft bill would allow certain acts that should be prosecuted - such as unnecessary suffering caused to an animal through neglect  or unnecessary mental suffering - to go unpunished.  committee chairman michael jack said:  any change in the law as it affects animals always arouses powerful emotions and great public interest.  this draft bill is no exception. my committee welcomes the development of an approach to animal welfare which doesn t just wait for a problem to occur but enables action to be taken to protect animals before irreversible suffering takes place.  but mr jack said the bill  very much had the feel of a  work in progress   and urged the government to guarantee that  an obligation to consult will be enshrined in law  before it extended legislative plans to areas such as pet fairs  circuses and game bird farms.  the government must work hard to take the rough edges of its initial proposals before the bill is introduced to parliament   he added.,angler could face prosecut angler fisherman could find prosecut plan crack anim cruelti committe mp warn sloppi word draft anim welfar bill could leav angler face court even though intend environ select committe say mp say concern govern consult directli plan improv anim welfar rais complex emot issu need resolv mp say call castiron guarante govern consult plan regul anim industri like pet fair game bird rear draft bill seek modernis improv anim welfar legisl intend protect kept anim companion anim set duti care addit maintain exist cruelti offenc creat offenc neglect keeper fail protect anim respons bill would allow anim welfar offic interven prevent harm anim well outlaw mutil anim unless demonstr anim best interest environ select committe make recommend hear evid organis individu one call amend bill prosecut engag fish inadvert encourag even later fail accept neither commerci fish recreat angl fall within remit draft bill therefor support govern intent exempt fish activ committe say amend need ensur case brought howev exempt fish govern care ensur person catch fish give cart blanch inflict unnecessari suffer cours pursu activ committe ad committe also say legal protect anim downgrad bill law abandon anim would significantli weaken mp urg govern redraft claus relat prosecut cruelti offenc stood draft bill would allow certain act prosecut unnecessari suffer caus anim neglect unnecessari mental suffer go unpunish committe chairman michael jack say chang law affect anim alway arous power emot great public interest draft bill except committe welcom develop approach anim welfar wait problem occur enabl action take protect anim irrevers suffer take place mr jack say bill much feel work progress urg govern guarante oblig consult enshrin law extend legisl plan area pet fair circus game bird farm govern must work hard take rough edg initi propos bill introduc parliament ad

773,1444,petrol duties frozen  brown says chancellor gordon brown has announced a freeze on fuel duty in his pre-budget speech to the commons on thursday.  mr brown told the house that government policy is to raise fuel duty at least in line with inflation each year to fulfil environmental commitments. but this financial year  because of  volatility in the oil market   he said the duty would be frozen. during 2000 many motorists campaigned against the rises but environmentalists believe less duty means more pollution. he said:  it is our policy that each year fuel duties should rise at least in line with inflation as we seek to meet our targets for reducing polluting emmissions and fund our public services.  but this financial year because of the sustained volatility in the oil market i propose to match the freeze in car vehicle licence duty with a continuation on the freeze on the main road fuel duties.   the rac welcomed the news  calling it an  early christmas present  for motorists. but the organisation urged drivers to continue to shop around to get the best price for petrol. environmental group transport 2000 said the freeze sends the wrong message to motorists.  we are concerned that although britain leads the world in rhetoric about climate change it often fails in practical action   said a spokesman. in 2000 the people s fuel lobby caused chaos by blocking roads with slow-moving convoys after mr brown threatened to raise fuel taxes. the chancellor did not raise duty that year  but despite threats of more protests in 2003  he added 1.28p per litre.,petrol duti frozen brown say chancellor gordon brown announc freez fuel duti prebudget speech common thursday mr brown told hous govern polici rais fuel duti least line inflat year fulfil environment commit financi year volatil oil market say duti would frozen mani motorist campaign rise environmentalist believ less duti mean pollut say polici year fuel duti rise least line inflat seek meet target reduc pollut emmiss fund public servic financi year sustain volatil oil market propos match freez car vehicl licenc duti continu freez main road fuel duti rac welcom news call earli christma present motorist organis urg driver continu shop around get best price petrol environment group transport say freez send wrong messag motorist concern although britain lead world rhetor climat chang often fail practic action say spokesman peopl fuel lobbi caus chao block road slowmov convoy mr brown threaten rais fuel tax chancellor rais duti year despit threat protest ad p per litr

775,1935,consumer concern over rfid tags consumers are very concerned about the use of radio frequency id (rfid) tags in shops  a survey says.  more than half of 2 000 people surveyed said they had privacy worries about the tags  which can be used to monitor stock on shelves or in warehouses. some consumer groups have expressed concern that the tags could be used to monitor shoppers once they had left shops with their purchases. the survey showed that awareness of tags among consumers in europe was low. the survey of consumers in the uk  france  germany and the netherlands was carried out by consultancy group capgemini. the firm works on behalf of more than 30 firms who are seeking to promote the growth of rfid technology. the tags are a combination of computer chip and antenna which can be read by a scanner - each item contains a unique identification number.  more than half (55%) of the respondents said they were either concerned or very concerned that rfid tags would allow businesses to track consumers via product purchases. fifty nine percent of people said they were worried that rfid tags would allow data to be used more freely by third parties. ard jan vetham  capgemini s principal consultant on rfid  said the survey showed that retailers needed to inform and educate people about rfid before it would become accepted technology.  acceptance of new technologies always has a tipping point at which consumers believe that benefits outweigh concerns.  with the right rfid approach and ongoing communication with consumers  the industry can reach this point.  he said that the survey also showed people would accept rfid if they felt that the technology could mean a reduction in car theft or faster recovery of stolen items. the tags are currently being used at one tesco distribution centre in the uk - the tags allow the rapid inventory of bulk items. they are also in use as a passcard for the m6 toll in the midlands  in the uk. mr vetham said the majority of people surveyed (52%) believed that rfid tags could be read from a distance. he said that was a misconception based on a lack of awareness of the technology. at least once consumer group - consumers against supermarket privacy invasion and numbering (caspian) - has claimed that rfid chips could be used to secretly identify people and the things they are carrying or wearing. all kinds of personal belongings  including clothes  could constantly broadcast messages about their whereabouts and their owners  it warned.,consum concern rfid tag consum concern use radio frequenc id rfid tag shop survey say half peopl survey say privaci worri tag use monitor stock shelv warehous consum group express concern tag could use monitor shopper left shop purchas survey show awar tag among consum europ low survey consum uk franc germani netherland carri consult group capgemini firm work behalf firm seek promot growth rfid technolog tag combin comput chip antenna read scanner item contain uniqu identif number half respond say either concern concern rfid tag would allow busi track consum via product purchas fifti nine percent peopl say worri rfid tag would allow data use freeli third parti ard jan vetham capgemini princip consult rfid say survey show retail need inform educ peopl rfid would becom accept technolog accept new technolog alway tip point consum believ benefit outweigh concern right rfid approach ongo commun consum industri reach point say survey also show peopl would accept rfid felt technolog could mean reduct car theft faster recoveri steal item tag current use one tesco distribut centr uk tag allow rapid inventori bulk item also use passcard m toll midland uk mr vetham say major peopl survey believ rfid tag could read distanc say misconcept base lack awar technolog least consum group consum supermarket privaci invas number caspian claim rfid chip could use secretli identifi peopl thing carri wear kind person belong includ cloth could constantli broadcast messag whereabout owner warn

781,1036,correction agency plans dropped plans to create a single correctional agency for scotland have been scrapped.  the scottish executive will not now merge the scottish prison service with local authority social work criminal justice departments. the national correctional agency would have provided a  one-stop  justice system but has been abandoned in the wake of stiff opposition. instead  scottish councils and the prison service will be compelled to work more closely to cut reoffending. the plan was to ensure offenders were monitored by the same body during and after prison  preventing many from being lost in the system and helping more of them to stop reoffending.  scotland s reoffending rate is high  with more than 60% of prisoners reconvicted within two years of release from jail. this is leading to an ever-expanding prison population and the executive wants to tackle the problem. ministers thought merging the prison service with the council-controlled criminal justice social work departments  which provide community sentences  might have provided an answer. however  following a consultation on the idea  justice minister cathy jamieson has decided to drop the plans. instead  ms jamieson will change the law to help produce a closer working relationship between both elements of the justice system.  she will announce the move in her criminal justice plan on monday  aiming to  break down the barriers between what happens in prison and what happens in the community . the new measures will place a new statutory duty on the sps to work with local authorities and others in area partnerships. a national advisory board on offender management will also be created to advise ms jamieson on the sps s role and performance in reducing reoffending. the minister said:  better joint working will help prisons play a much stronger role in ending reoffending behaviour and in particular help address the revolving door of reoffending that sees offenders entering prison for short periods during which little is done to address the behaviour that brought them there.  communities who are paying the price for this reoffending - both in terms of crime and in terms of prison costs - expect better.  it costs the taxpayer £35 000 a year to provide each prison place and that cost is increasing.  taxpayers who suffer the consequences of crime also end up paying for keeping those people in prison.  therefore  as we continue to invest in the service  it is only right that we seek to ensure that that service becomes more accountable to the public it serves  to ministers and to parliament.,correct agenc plan drop plan creat singl correct agenc scotland scrap scottish execut merg scottish prison servic local author social work crimin justic depart nation correct agenc would provid onestop justic system abandon wake stiff opposit instead scottish council prison servic compel work close cut reoffend plan ensur offend monitor bodi prison prevent mani lose system help stop reoffend scotland reoffend rate high prison reconvict within two year releas jail lead everexpand prison popul execut want tackl problem minist thought merg prison servic councilcontrol crimin justic social work depart provid commun sentenc might provid answer howev follow consult idea justic minist cathi jamieson decid drop plan instead m jamieson chang law help produc closer work relationship element justic system announc move crimin justic plan monday aim break barrier happen prison happen commun new measur place new statutori duti sp work local author other area partnership nation advisori board offend manag also creat advis m jamieson sp role perform reduc reoffend minist say well joint work help prison play much strong role end reoffend behaviour particular help address revolv door reoffend see offend enter prison short period littl do address behaviour brought commun pay price reoffend term crime term prison cost expect well cost taxpay £ year provid prison place cost increas taxpay suffer consequ crime also end pay keep peopl prison therefor continu invest servic right seek ensur servic becom account public serv minist parliament

784,1328,have hackers recruited your pc  more than one million computers on the net have been hijacked to attack websites and pump out spam and viruses.  the huge number was revealed by security researchers who have spent months tracking more than 100 networks of remotely-controlled machines. the largest network of so-called zombie networks spied on by the team was made up of 50 000 hijacked home computers. data was gathered using machines that looked innocent but which logged everything hackers did to them.  the detailed look at zombie or  bot nets of hijacked computers was done by the honeynet project - a group of security researchers that gather information using networks of computers that act as  honey pots  to attract hackers and gather information about how they work. while  bot nets have been known about for some time  estimates of how widespread they are from security firms have varied widely.  to gather its information the german arm of the honeynet project created software tools to log what happened to the machines they put on the web. getting the machines hijacked was worryingly easy. the longest time a honeynet machine survived without being found by an automatic attack tool was only a few minutes. the shortest compromise time was only a few seconds. the research found that  once compromised machines tend to report in to chat channels on irc servers and wait instructions from the malicious hacker behind the tools used to recruit the machine. many well-known vulnerabilities in the windows operating system were exploited by  bot net controllers to find and take over target machines. especially coveted were home pcs sitting on broadband connections that are never turned off.  the months of surveillance revealed that the different  bot nets - which involve a few hundred to tens of thousands of machines - are used for a variety of purposes. many are used as relays for spam  to route unwanted adverts to pc users or as launch platforms for viruses. but the research team found that many are put to very different uses. during the monitoring period  the team saw  bot nets used to launch 226 distributed denial-of-service attacks on 99 separate targets. these attacks bombard websites with data in an attempt to overwhelm the target. using a  bot net of machines spread around different networks and nations makes such attacks hard to defend against. one ddos attack was used by one firm to knock its competitors offline. other  bot nets were used to abuse the google adsense program that rewards websites for displaying adverts from the search engine. some networks were used to abuse or manipulate online polls and games. criminals also seem to be starting to use  bot nets for mass identity theft  to host websites that look like those of banks so confidential information can be gathered and to peep into online traffic to steal sensitive data.  leveraging the power of several thousand bots  it is viable to take down almost any website or network instantly   said the researchers.  even in unskilled hands  it should be obvious that  bot nets are a loaded and powerful weapon.,hacker recruit pc one million comput net hijack attack websit pump spam virus huge number reveal secur research spent month track network remotelycontrol machin large network socal zombi network spi team make hijack home comput data gather use machin look innoc log everyth hacker detail look zombi bot net hijack comput do honeynet project group secur research gather inform use network comput act honey pot attract hacker gather inform work bot net know time estim widespread secur firm vari wide gather inform german arm honeynet project creat softwar tool log happen machin put web get machin hijack worryingli easi long time honeynet machin surviv without found automat attack tool minut shortest compromis time second research found compromis machin tend report chat channel irc server wait instruct malici hacker behind tool use recruit machin mani wellknown vulner window oper system exploit bot net control find take target machin especi covet home pc sit broadband connect never turn month surveil reveal differ bot net involv hundr ten thousand machin use varieti purpos mani use relay spam rout unwant advert pc user launch platform virus research team found mani put differ use monitor period team saw bot net use launch distribut denialofservic attack separ target attack bombard websit data attempt overwhelm target use bot net machin spread around differ network nation make attack hard defend one ddo attack use one firm knock competitor offlin bot net use abus googl adsens program reward websit display advert search engin network use abus manipul onlin poll game crimin also seem start use bot net mass ident theft host websit look like bank confidenti inform gather peep onlin traffic steal sensit data leverag power sever thousand bot viabl take almost websit network instantli say research even unskil hand obviou bot net load power weapon

787,1467,france set for new da vinci novel french booksellers are braced for a rush of interest after another book from the author of the da vinci code is translated into french.  angels and demons  by us author dan brown  will go on sale on wednesday. the da vinci code is set in paris - including the louvre - and has sold around one million copies in france. the main character  robert langdon  also appears in angels and demons. the da vinci code is being made into a film starring tom hanks. angels and demons was written before the da vinci code  which has sold more than 20 million copies worldwide  and been translated into more than 40 languages  since it was released in 2003. angels and demons is set mainly in rome as symbologist robert langdon follows a 400-year-old trail to try to uncover a plot by an ancient brotherhood  the illuminati  to blow up the vatican.  the novel deals with moral issues such as the debate between science and religion and also seeks to uncover some of the mysteries surrounding the pope. on his website  brown wrote:  i think the reason angels and demons is raising eyebrows right now is that it opens some vatican closets most people don t even know exist.  but i think most people understand that an organisation as old and powerful as the vatican could not possibly have risen to power without acquiring a few skeletons in their closets.  such is the success of the da vinci code in france  special tours have been organised to trace langdon s footsteps  including the the louvre museum and the saint sulpice church. the louvre has also given permission for parts of the film version to be shot in the museum. the film  to be directed by a beautiful mind s ron howard  is due to start filming at the paris museum in may and stars hanks alongside french actress audrey tautou.,franc set new da vinci novel french booksel brace rush interest anoth book author da vinci code translat french angel demon u author dan brown go sale wednesday da vinci code set pari includ louvr sell around one million copi franc main charact robert langdon also appear angel demon da vinci code make film star tom hank angel demon write da vinci code sell million copi worldwid translat languag sinc releas angel demon set mainli rome symbologist robert langdon follow yearold trail tri uncov plot ancient brotherhood illuminati blow vatican novel deal moral issu debat scienc religion also seek uncov mysteri surround pope websit brown write think reason angel demon rais eyebrow right open vatican closet peopl even know exist think peopl understand organis old power vatican could possibl risen power without acquir skeleton closet success da vinci code franc special tour organis trace langdon footstep includ louvr museum saint sulpic church louvr also give permiss part film version shot museum film direct beauti mind ron howard due start film pari museum may star hank alongsid french actress audrey tautou
788,563,cable offers video-on-demand cable firms ntl and telewest have both launched video-on-demand services as the battle between satellite and cable tv heats up.  movies from sony pictures  walt disney  touchstone  miramax  columbia and buena vista will be among those on offer. the service is similar to sky plus  as users can pause  fast forward and rewind content  but they cannot store programmes on their set top box - yet. it could sound the death knell for some tv channels  telewest predicts.  it allows us to demonstrate a clear competitive advantage over sky for the first time in many years   said telewest chief executive eric tveter.   video-on-demand will offer a deeper range of content than currently exists on tv. there will be less compromising around the tv schedule and some of the less popular channels may go by the wayside   said philip snalune  director of products at telewest. telewest customers in bristol and ntl viewers in glasgow will be the first to test the new service  which sees a raft of movies on offer for 24 hour rental. during the year  the service will be extended to all cable regions. films will range in price from £1 or £2 for archived movies to £3.50 for current releases. new releases initially on offer will include 50 first dates  kill bill: volume 2  gothika and the station agent. in addition  ntl is offering children s programmes  adult content  music video and concerts. telewest will launch similar services later in the year. ntl is also offering viewers the chance to catch up with programmes they have missed. its pick of the week service will offer a selection of bbc programmes from the previous seven days such as eastenders  casualty  top gear and antiques roadshow. the bbc is trialling a similar service  offering broadband users the chance to watch programmes already broadcast on their pc. for telewest it is the beginning of a £20m investment in tv-on-demand which will also see the launch of a personal video recorder (pvr). pvr has been a big success for sky because it gives customers control over programmes. satellite customers without pvr cannot pause  rewind or fast forward their programmes.  with both services on offer from telewest  mr tveter is confident the cable firm can dent not just the viewing figures for terrestrial tv but also gain a huge competitive advantage over sky.   we offer the best of both worlds and most households have an interest in having both video-on-demand and pvr   he said. video rental stores may also have to watch their back.  video-on-demand is better than having a video-store in your living room and is more convenient   he said. ntl said it had not ruled out the possibility of offering a pvr but for the moment is concentrating on video-on-demand.  pvr is a recording mechanism whereas what we are offering is truly on demand   said a spokesman for the company. video-on-demand has the added advantage of not requiring a separate set-top box or extra remote controls  he added. adam thomas  an analyst at research firm informa media believes the time is ripe for video-on-demand to flourish.  while sky will remain the dominant force in uk pay tv for some time to come  ntl and telewest seem well placed to successfully ride this second wave of vod enthusiasm and  if marketed correctly  this could help them eat into sky s lead   he said.,cabl offer

789,2044,the year search became personal the odds are that when you fire up your browser  you go straight to your favourite search engine  rather than type in a web address.  some may see this as the height of laziness  but in an era of information overload  search has become a vital tool in navigating the net. it is symptomatic of how the way we use the internet is changing. and as google has shown  there is money in offering a service that people cannot live without. there is no shortage of companies vying for the loyalty of web searchers  offering a wealth of different services and tools to help you find what you want. over the past 12 months  giants of the technology world such as microsoft and yahoo have sought to grab a slice of the search action.  user experience has contributed to people searching more   said yonca brunini of yahoo. as people become more familiar with the internet  they tend to spend more time online and ask more queries  she said.  the other second thing is broadband   ms brunini told the bbc news website.  this will do to internet what colour has done to tv.   but search is hardly a new phenomenon. it has been around since the early days of the net.  veteran surfers will remember old-timers like hotbot and altavista.  search was always important   said urs holzle  google vice-president of operations.  we trumpeted that in 1999. it is even truer now as there are more users and more information.   people didn t realise that search was the future. the financials have something to do with it.  google has shown web commerce can work through its targeted small adverts  which appear at the top and down the right-hand side of a page and are related to the original search. these small ads helped google reach revenues of $805.9m for the three months to september. others have woken up to the fact that you can make money out of web queries.  once you see there is a market  microsoft is bound to step to it. if microsoft sees search as important  then nobody queries it   said mr holzle.  microsoft is just one of the net giants muscling in on search. yahoo  ask jeeves  amazon and a handful of smaller outfits are all seeking to capture eyeballs.  web users face a plethora of choices as each company tries to outflank google by rolling out new search products such as desktop search. it reflects how the battlefield has shifted from the net to your pc. search is not just about finding your way around the web. it is now about unlocking information hidden in the gigabytes of documents  images and music on hard drives. for all these advances  search is still a clumsy tool  often failing to come up with exactly what you had in mind. in order to do a better job  search engines are trying to get to know you better  doing a better job of remembering  cataloguing and managing all the information you come across.  personalisation is going to be a big area for the future   said yahoo s yonca brunini.  whoever cracks that and gives you the information you want is going to be the winner. we have to understand you to give you better results that are tailored to you.  this is perhaps the holy grail of search  understanding what it is you are looking for and providing it quickly. the problem is that no one yet knows how to get there.,year search becam person odd fire browser go straight favourit search

790,319,uk bank seals south korean deal uk-based bank standard chartered said it would spend $3.3bn (£1.8bn) to buy one of south korea s main retail banks.  standard chartered said acquiring korea first bank (kfb) fulfilled a strategic objective of building a bigger presence in asia s third largest economy. its shares fell nearly 3% in london as the bank raised funds for the deal by selling new stocks worth £1bn ($1.8bn)  equal to 10% of its share capital. standard chartered expects about 16% of future group revenue to come from kfb.  the south korean bank will also make up 22% of the group s total assets. the move  a year after citigroup beat standard chartered to buy koram bank  would be the south korean financial sector s biggest foreign takeover. this time around  standard chartered is thought to have beaten hsbc to the deal. kfb is south korea s seventh largest bank  with 3 million retail customers  6% of the country s banking market and an extensive branch network.  the country s banking market is three times the size of hong kong s with annual revenues of $44bn. standard chartered has its headquarters in london but does two thirds of its business in asia  and much of the rest in africa.  we re comfortable with the price paid...the key here has been speed and decisiveness in making sure that we won   said standard chartered chief executive mervyn davies at a london press conference. standard chartered said kfb was a  well-managed  conservatively run bank with a highly skilled workforce  and represented a  significant acquisition in a growth market . in london  standard chartered s sale of 118 million new shares to institutional investors pushed its share price down  and contributing to the ftse 100 s 0.3% decline. standard chartered s shares were 28 pence lower at 925p by midday. some analysts also queried whether standard chartered had overpaid for kfb. the deal  which requires regulatory approval  is expected to be completed by april 2005 and to be earnings accretive in 2006  standard chartered said.  rival banking giant hsbc  which is based in london and hong kong  was also in the running. standard chartered is believed to have gained the initiative by putting together a bid during the christmas break.  they were able to move so quickly it caught hsbc by surprise   the financial times newspaper quoted an insider in the talks as saying. hsbc will now have to wait for the next south korean bank in line to be sold off - thought likely to be korea exchange bank  also currently in the hands of a us group. standard chartered said it was buying 100% of kfb  an agreement that would bring an end to the bank s complex dual ownership. the south korean government owns 51.4% of kfb  while the remaining shareholding  and operational control  are in the hands of us private equity group newbridge capital. newbridge bought its stake during the government s nationalisation of several banks in the wake of the 1997 asia-wide currency crisis which crippled south korea s financial institutions.  south korea s economy is expected to grow by 4.5% this year. although often thought of an export-driven economy  south korea s service sector has overtaken manufacturing in the last decade or so. services now make up roughly 40% of the economy  and consumer spending and retail banking have become increasingly important. in the aftermath of the asian financial crisis  the government encouraged the growth of consumer credit. bad loan problems followed; lg card  the country s biggest credit card provider  has been struggling to avoid bankruptcy for months  for instance. but analysts believe south korea s financial services industry is still in its infancy  offering plenty of scope for new products. standard chartered sees  the opportunity to create value by the introduction of more sophisticated banking products . since 1999  kfb has been restructured from a wholesale bank into a retail bank focused on mortgage lending  which makes up 45% of its loans.,uk bank seal south korean deal ukbas bank standard charter say would spend bn £bn buy one south korea main retail bank standard charter say acquir korea first bank kfb fulfil strateg object build big presenc asia third large economi share fell nearli london bank rais fund deal sell new stock worth £bn bn equal share capit standard charter expect futur group revenu come kfb south korean bank also make group total asset move year citigroup beat standard charter buy koram bank would south korean financi sector big foreign takeov time around standard charter thought beaten hsbc deal kfb south korea seventh large bank million retail custom countri bank market extens branch network countri bank market three time size hong kong annual revenu bn standard charter headquart london two third busi asia much rest africa comfort price paidth key speed decis make sure say standard charter chief execut mervyn davi london press confer standard charter say kfb wellmanag conserv run bank highli skill workforc repres signific acquisit growth market london standard charter sale million new share institut investor push share price contribut ftse declin standard charter share penc low p midday analyst also queri whether standard charter overpaid kfb deal requir regulatori approv expect complet april earn accret standard charter say rival bank giant hsbc base london hong kong also run standard charter believ gain initi put togeth bid christma break abl move quickli caught hsbc surpris financi time newspap quot insid talk say hsbc wait next south korean bank line sell thought like korea exchang bank also current hand u group standard charter say buy kfb agreement would bring end bank complex dual ownership south korean govern own kfb remain sharehold oper control hand u privat equiti group newbridg capit newbridg bought stake govern nationalis sever bank wake asiawid currenc crisi crippl south korea financi institut south korea economi expect grow year although often thought exportdriven economi south korea servic sector overtaken manufactur last decad servic make roughli economi consum spend retail bank becom increasingli import aftermath asian financi crisi govern encourag growth consum credit bad loan problem follow lg card countri big credit card provid struggl avoid bankruptci month instanc analyst believ south korea financi servic industri still infanc offer plenti scope new product standard charter see opportun creat valu introduct sophist bank product sinc kfb restructur wholesal bank retail bank focus mortgag lend make loan

792,814,us budget deficit to reach $368bn the us budget deficit is set to hit a worse-than-expected $368bn (£197bn) this year  officials said on tuesday.  the cost of military operations still needs to be factored in  with analysts saying the deficit could end up a further $100bn in the red. past congressional budget office (cbo) forecasts said there would be a $348bn shortfall in the 2005 fiscal year. in recent months  the dollar has weakened amid market jitters about the size of the budget and trade deficits. in november  the gap between us exports and imports widened to more than $60bn  a record figure. the cbo says it envisages a further  orderly  decline in the greenback over the next two years as the twin deficit drives dollar investors away. but the non-partisan fiscal watchdog notes the declines will help exporters and boost us economic growth.  the budget deficit hit a record $412bn in the 12 months to 30 september 2004  after reaching $377bn in the previous fiscal year. the cbo also forecast a total shortfall of $855bn for the years from 2006 to 2015  an improvement on previous projections. however  analysts say the new figures fail to take into account the potential $2-$3.8 trillion costs of the president s plan to revamp state pensions and extend tax cuts. the figure could also be worsened by any further military costs. republicans have blamed the size of the deficit on slow economic conditions after the 11 september attacks and ongoing military operations in iraq and afghanistan. one of president george w bush s election pledges was to halve the budget deficit within five years. but democrats have accused the president of excluding iraq-related costs from previous budgets to meet the aim of reducing the deficit  a charge which the administration denies. on tuesday  the us administration asked congress for additional funds for military operations.,u budget deficit reach bn u budget deficit set hit worsethanexpect bn £bn year offici say tuesday cost militari oper still need factor analyst say deficit could end bn red past congression budget offic cbo forecast say would bn shortfal fiscal year recent month dollar weaken amid market jitter size budget trade deficit novemb gap u export import widen bn record figur cbo say envisag orderli declin greenback next two year twin deficit drive dollar investor away nonpartisan fiscal watchdog note declin help export boost u econom growth budget deficit hit record bn month septemb reach bn previou fiscal year cbo also forecast total shortfal bn year improv previou project howev analyst say new figur fail take account potenti trillion cost presid plan revamp state pension extend tax cut figur could also worsen militari cost republican blame size deficit slow econom condit septemb attack ongo militari oper iraq afghanistan one presid georg w bush elect pledg halv budget deficit within five year democrat accus presid exclud iraqrel cost previou budget meet aim reduc deficit charg administr deni tuesday u administr ask congress addit fund militari oper
793,1992,faith schools citizenship warning schools must improve the quality of citizenship lessons - or social cohesion and democracy will suffer  says the education watchdog.  independent faith schools were singled out by ofsted chief  david bell  for not doing enough to promote the  wider tenets of british society . mr bell said muslim  jewish and evangelical christian schools must be  intolerant of intolerance . diversity  certainly must not mean segregated or separate   he said. mr bell s speech called for a much greater effort in all types of schools to teach citizenship - with an accompanying survey showing that young people knew little about politics and had no enthusiasm to find out more.  badly-taught citizenship lessons have previously been criticised by mr bell  and in a speech to the hansard society  he warned that it was failing to pass on an understanding of democracy  public service and shared values. he highlighted his particular concern for citizenship in the growing number of independent faith schools - which he said included about 100 muslim  100 evangelical christian and 50 jewish schools.  mr bell expressed concern about schools which did not teach children enough about a  common heritage  and needed to do more to promote principles of mutual tolerance and social inclusion.  i worry that many young people are being educated in faith-based schools  with little appreciation of their wider responsibilities and obligations to british society   said mr bell. the ofsted chief said his forthcoming annual report would make particular reference to muslim schools.  many must adapt their curriculum to ensure that it provides pupils with a broad general knowledge of public institutions and services in england and helps them to acquire an appreciation of and respect for other cultures in a way that promotes tolerance and harmony.  mr bell said such questions of religion and cultural identity were  tricky issues . but he argued that  we must not allow our recognition of diversity to become apathy in the face of any challenge to our coherence as a nation .  i would go further and say that an awareness of our common heritage as british citizens  equal under the law  should enable us to assert with confidence that we are intolerant of intolerance  illiberalism and attitudes and values that demean the place of certain sections of our community  be they women or people living in non-traditional relationships   said mr bell.,faith school citizenship warn school must improv qualiti citizenship lesson social cohes democraci suffer say educ watchdog independ faith school singl ofst chief david bell enough promot wider tenet british societi mr bell say muslim jewish evangel christian school must intoler intoler diver certainli must mean segreg separ say mr bell speech call much great effort type school teach citizenship accompani survey show young peopl knew littl polit enthusiasm find badlytaught citizenship lesson previous criticis mr bell speech hansard societi warn fail pas understand democraci public servic share valu highlight particular concern citizenship grow number independ faith school say includ muslim evangel christian jewish school mr bell express concern school teach child enough common heritag need promot principl mutual toler social inclus worri mani young peopl educ faithbas school littl appreci wider respons oblig british societi say mr bell ofst chief say forthcom annual report would make particular refer muslim school mani must adapt curriculum ensur provid pupil broad gener knowledg public institut servic england help acquir appreci respect cultur way promot toler harmoni mr bell say question religion cultur ident tricki issu argu must allow recognit diver becom apathi face challeng coher nation would go say awar common heritag british citizen equal law enabl u assert confid intoler intoler illiber attitud valu demean place certain section commun woman peopl live nontradit relationship say mr bell
794,1488,labour chooses manchester the labour party will hold its 2006 autumn conference in manchester and not blackpool  it has been confirmed.  the much trailed decision was ratified by labour s ruling national executive committee in a break with the traditional choice of a seaside venue. it will be the first time since 1917 that the party has chosen manchester to host the annual event. blackpool will get the much smaller february spring conference instead in what will be seen as a placatory move.  for years the main political parties have rotated between blackpool  bournemouth and brighton. and the news the much larger annual conference is not to gather in blackpool will be seen as a blow in the coastal resort. in 1998 the party said it would not return to blackpool but did so in 2002. the following year bournemouth hosted the event before the party signed a two year deal for brighton to host the autumn conference.  colin asplin  blackpool hotel association said:  we have tried very hard to make sure they come back to blackpool.  obviously we have failed in that. i just hope manchester can handle the crowds.  it amazes me that the labour party  which is a working class party  doesn t want to come to the main working class resort in the country.  the exact cost to blackpool in terms of lost revenue for hotel accommodation is not yet known but it is thought that block bookings will be taken at the major manchester hotels after the official announcement.,labour choos manchest labour parti hold autumn confer manchest blackpool confirm much trail decis ratifi labour rule nation execut committe break tradit choic seasid venu first time sinc parti chosen manchest host annual event blackpool get much small februari spring confer instead see placatori move year main polit parti rotat blackpool bournemouth brighton news much large annual confer gather blackpool see blow coastal resort parti say would return blackpool follow year bournemouth host event parti sign two year deal brighton host autumn confer colin asplin blackpool hotel associ say tri hard make sure come back blackpool obvious fail hope manchest handl crowd amaz labour parti work class parti want come main work class resort countri exact cost blackpool term lose revenu hotel accommod yet know thought block book take major manchest hotel offici announc
795,192,the  ticking budget  facing the us the budget proposals laid out by the administration of us president george w bush are highly controversial. the washington-based economic policy institute  which tends to be critical of the president  looks at possible fault lines. us politicians and citizens of all political persuasions are in for a dose of shock therapy. without major changes in current policies and political prejudices  the federal budget simply cannot hold together. news coverage of the bush budget will be dominated by debates about spending cuts  but the fact is these will be large cuts in small programs. from the standpoint of the big fiscal trends  the cuts are gratuitous and the big budget train wreck is yet to come. under direct threat will be the federal government s ability to make good on its debts to the social security trust fund. as soon as 2018  the fund will begin to require some cash returns on its bond holdings in order to finance all promised benefits.  the trigger for the coming shock will be rising federal debt  which will grow in 10 years  by conservative estimates  to more than half the nation s total annual output.  this upward trend will force increased borrowing by the federal government  putting upward pressure on interest rates faced by consumers and business. even now  a growing share of us borrowing is from abroad. the us government cannot finance its operations without heavy borrowing from the central banks of japan and china  among other nations. this does not bode well for us influence in the world. the decline of the dollar is a warning sign that current economic trends cannot continue. the dollar is already sinking. before too long  credit markets are likely to react  and interest rates will creep upwards. that will be the shock.  interest-sensitive industries will feel pain immediately - sectors such as housing  automobiles  other consumer durables  agriculture  and small business. some will recall the news footage of angry farmers driving their heavy equipment around the us capitol in the late 1970s. there will be no need for constitutional amendments to balance the budget. the public outcry will force congress to act. whether it will act wisely is another matter. how did this happen   by definition  the deficit means too little revenue and too much spending - but this neutral description doesn t adequately capture the current situation. federal revenues are at 1950s levels  while spending remains where it has been in recent decades - much higher. in addition  the united states has two significant military missions. the bush administration s chosen remedy is the least feasible one. reducing domestic spending  or eliminating  waste  fraud and abuse  is toothless because this slice of the budget is too small to solve the problem. indeed  if congress were rash enough to balance the budget in this way  there would hardly be any such spending left. law enforcement  space exploration  environmental clean-up  economic development  the small business administration  housing  veterans  benefits  aid to state and local governments would all but disappear. it s fantasy to think these routine government functions could be slashed. the biggest spending growth areas are defence (including homeland security)  and health care for the elderly and the poor. to some extent  increases in these areas are inevitable. the us population is aging  and the nation does face genuine threats in the world. but serious savings can only be found where the big money is. savings in health care spending that do not come at the expense of health can only be achieved with wholesale reform of the entire system  public and private. brute force budget cuts or spending caps would ill-serve the nation s elderly and indigent.  on the revenue side  the lion s share of revenue lost to tax cuts enacted since 2000 will have to be replaced.  some rearranging could hold many people harmless and focus most of the pain on those with relatively high incomes. finally  blind allegiance to a balanced budget will have to be abandoned. there is no good reason to fixate on it  anyway. moderate deficits and slowly rising federal debt can be sustained indefinitely. borrowing for investments in education and infrastructure that pay off in future years makes sense. the sooner we face that reality  the sooner workable reforms can be pursued. first on the list should be tax reform to raise revenue  simplify the tax code  and restore some fairness eroded by the bush tax cuts. second should be a dispassionate re-evaluation of the huge increase in defence spending over the past three years  much of it unrelated to afghanistan  iraq  or terrorism. third must be the start of a serious debate on large-scale health care reform. one thing is certain - destroying the budget in order to save it is not going to equip the us economy and government for the challenges of this new century.,tick budget face u budget propos laid administr u presid georg w bush highli controversi washingtonbas econom polici institut tend critic presid look possibl fault line u politician citizen polit persuas dose shock therapi without major chang current polici polit prejudic feder budget simpli hold togeth news coverag bush budget domin debat spend cut fact larg cut small program standpoint big fiscal trend cut gratuit big budget train wreck yet come direct threat feder govern abil make good debt social secur trust fund soon fund begin requir cash return bond hold order financ promis benefit trigger come shock rise feder debt grow year conserv estim half nation total annual output upward trend forc increas borrow feder govern put upward pressur interest rate face consum busi even grow share u borrow abroad u govern financ oper without heavi borrow central bank japan china among nation bode well u influenc world declin dollar warn sign current econom trend continu dollar alreadi sink long credit market like react interest rate creep upward shock interestsensit industri feel pain immedi sector hous automobil consum durabl agricultur small busi recal news footag angri farmer drive heavi equip around u capitol late s need constitut amend balanc budget public outcri forc congress act whether act wise anoth matter happen definit deficit mean littl revenu much spend neutral descript adequ captur current situat feder revenu s level spend remain recent decad much high addit unit state two signific militari mission bush administr chosen remedi least feasibl one reduc domest spend elimin wast fraud abus toothless slice budget small solv problem inde congress rash enough balanc budget way would hardli spend left law enforc space explor environment cleanup econom develop small busi administr hous veteran benefit aid state local govern would disappear fantasi think routin govern function could slash big spend growth area defenc includ homeland secur health care elderli poor extent increas area inevit u popul age nation face genuin threat world seriou save found big money save health care spend come expens health achiev wholesal reform entir system public privat brute forc budget cut spend cap would illserv nation elderli indig revenu side lion share revenu lose tax cut enact sinc replac rearrang could hold mani peopl harmless focu pain rel high incom final blind allegi balanc budget abandon good reason fixat anyway moder deficit slowli rise feder debt sustain indefinit borrow invest educ infrastructur pay futur year make sen sooner face realiti sooner workabl reform pursu first list tax reform rais revenu simplifi tax code restor fair erod bush tax cut second dispassion reevalu huge increas defenc spend past three year much unrel afghanistan iraq terror third must start seriou debat largescal health care reform one thing certain destroy budget order save go equip u economi govern challeng new centuri

797,306,faultless federer has no equal roger federer - nice bloke  fantastic tennis player - the ultimate sportsman.  when lleyton hewitt shook his hand after getting another thrashing  a third in as many months  the australian said;  you re the best.  how right he is. the stats speak for themselves: 11 titles from 11 finals during 2004 - three of them grand slams - and 13 final victories in a row going back to vienna 2003. that s an open-era record. hewitt  at times in houston  showed form which easily matched his grand slam-winning efforts of 2001 and 2002. but he was outplayed. twice. hewitt  along with andy roddick and marat safin  is sure to be prominent during 2005. but realistically  all three will be fighting for the world number two ranking. according to all those players and even federer himself  the swiss star is in a different league.   right now i feel that a little bit   he told bbc sport.  i ve dominated all the top ten players. they say nice things about me because i have beaten them all. i am dominating the game right now and i hope it continues!  the number one player in the world is also the main man for promoting the sport off court. he has just been voted  by the international tennis writers  as the best  ambassador for tennis  on the atp tour. he has time for everyone. every match  from first round to final  is followed by a series of press interviews in three languages; english  french and swiss-german. after a major win  there are extra requests  obligations and interviews  all seen through to the end with courtesy and  most importantly  good humour.  you guys are funny  i have a good time with you guys   he said  genuinely happy to talk into yet another tape recorder.  i see you pretty much every day on the tour so to give away an hour for interviews is really no problem for me.  if i can promote tennis and the sport then that is good for me. people say thanks back and that is nice.  what a refreshing attitude from someone who could easily dominate the sports pages for a decade. it sums up his modest personality. shortly after collecting a waterford crystal trophy  a mercedes convertible and a tasty cheque for $1.5m  federer addressed the houston crowd and concluded by saying  thanks for having me . now he just needs to find a way of winning the french open  the one grand slam to so far elude him.,faultless feder equal roger feder nice bloke fantast tenni player ultim sportsman lleyton hewitt shook hand get anoth thrash third mani month australian say best right stat speak titl final three grand slam final victori row go back vienna openera record hewitt time houston show form easili match grand slamwin effort outplay twice hewitt along andi roddick marat safin sure promin realist three fight world number two rank accord player even feder swiss star differ leagu right feel littl bit told bbc sport domin top ten player say nice thing beaten domin game right hope continu number one player world also main man promot sport court vote intern tenni writer best ambassador tenni atp tour time everyon everi match first round final follow seri press interview three languag english french swissgerman major win extra request oblig interview see end courtesi importantli good humour guy funni good time guy say genuin happi talk yet anoth tape record see pretti much everi day tour give away hour interview realli problem promot tenni sport good peopl say thank back nice refresh attitud someon could easili domin sport page decad sum modest person shortli collect waterford crystal trophi merced convert tasti chequ m feder address houston crowd conclud say thank need find way win french open one grand slam far elud
798,204,how to make a gigapixel picture the largest digital panoramic photo in the world has been created by researchers in the netherlands.  the finished image is 2.5 billion pixels in size - making it about 500 times the resolution of images produced by good consumer digital cameras. the huge image of delft was created by stitching together 600 single snaps of the dutch city taken at a fixed spot. if printed out in standard 300 dots per inch resolution  the picture would be 2.5m high and 6m long.  the researchers have put the image on a website which lets viewers explore the wealth of detail that it captures. tools on the page let viewers zoom in on the city and its surroundings in great detail. the website is already proving popular and currently has more than 200 000 visitors every day.  the image was created by imaging experts from the dutch research and technology laboratory tno which created the 2.5 gigapixel photo as a summer time challenge.  the goal of the project was to be one of the first groups to make gigapixel images. the first image of such a size was manually constructed by us photographer max lyons in november 2003. that image portrayed bryce canyon national park  in utah  and was made up of 196 separate photographs. the panorama of delft is a little staid in contrast to the dramatic rockscape captured in mr lyons  image.  he did it all by hand  which was an enormous effort  and we got the idea that if you use automatic techniques  it would be feasible to build a larger image   said jurgen den hartog  one of the tno researchers behind the project.  we were not competing with mr lyons  but it started as a lunchtime bet.   the dutch team used already available technologies  although it had to upgrade them to be able to handle the high-resolution image.   we had to rewrite almost all the tools   me den hartog told the bbc news website.  all standard windows viewers available would not be able to load such a large image  so we had to develop one ourselves.  the 600 component pictures were taken on july 2004 by a computer-controlled camera with a 400 mm lens. each image was made to slightly overlap so they could be accurately arranged into a composite. the stitching process was also done automatically using five powerful pcs over three days. following the success of this project  and with promises of help from others  the tno team is considering creating a full 360-degree panoramic view of another dutch city  with even higher resolution.,make gigapixel pictur large digit panoram photo world creat research netherland finish imag billion pixel size make time resolut imag produc good consum digit camera huge imag delft creat stitch togeth singl snap dutch citi take fix spot print standard dot per inch resolut pictur would m high m long research put imag websit let viewer explor wealth detail captur tool page let viewer zoom citi surround great detail websit alreadi prove popular current visitor everi day imag creat imag expert dutch research technolog laboratori tno creat gigapixel photo summer time challeng goal project one first group make gigapixel imag first imag size manual construct u photograph max lyon novemb imag portray bryce canyon nation park utah make separ photograph panorama delft littl staid contrast dramat rockscap captur mr lyon imag hand enorm effort get idea use automat techniqu would feasibl build large imag say jurgen den hartog one tno research behind project compet mr lyon start lunchtim bet dutch team use alreadi avail technolog although upgrad abl handl highresolut imag rewrit almost tool den hartog told bbc news websit standard window viewer avail would abl load larg imag develop one compon pictur take juli computercontrol camera mm len imag make slightli overlap could accur arrang composit stitch process also do automat use five power pc three day follow success project promis help other tno team consid creat full degre panoram view anoth dutch citi even high resolut
799,1192,jones files lawsuit against conte marion jones has filed a lawsuit for defamation against balco boss victor conte following his allegations that he gave her performance-enhancing drugs.  the sydney olympic gold medallist says conte damaged her reputation and she is seeking $25m (£13m) in the suit. conte  whose company is at the centre of a doping investigation  made the claims in a us television programme. he and three others were indicted in february by a federal grand jury for a variety of alleged offences. in an email to the associated press on wednesday  conte said:  i stand by everything i said . jones won three gold medals and two bronzes in sydney in 2000. her lawsuit  filed in the us district court in san francisco  said the sprinter had passed a lie detector test and that she  has never taken banned performance-enhancing drugs . conte s statements  the suit added  were  false and malicious . after the abc television program earlier this month  jones  lawyer richard nicholls said:  marion has steadfastly maintained her position throughout: she has never  ever used performance-enhancing drugs.  victor conte is a man facing a 42-count federal indictment  while marion jones is one of america s most decorated female athletes. mr conte s statements have been wildly contradictory.  mr conte chose to make unsubstantiated allegations on television  while marion jones demanded to take and then passed a lie detector examination.   mr conte is simply not credible. we challenge him to submit to the same lie detector procedure that marion jones passed.  the sport s ruling body  the iaaf  is taking a cautious approach to conte s allegations but contacted the us anti-doping agency. communications director nick davies said the iaaf would seek to contact conte  for further information . but davies stressed it would be up to the american authorities to decide whether they will take action against jones in light of conte s television interview and the world governing body would monitor the situation closely.  if it is felt there is case to answer  it would be for its national governing body (usa track and field) to take the appropriate disciplinary action   he added.  the us anti-doping agency has proved itself to be very diligent in its anti-doping war.  and i am sure  like ourselves  they will be watching the television programme with great interest.  jones  who is under investigation for steroid use by the us anti-doping agency  has continually denied ever taking illegal substances since being investigated in the balco scandal  although she praised a zinc supplement conte marketed. jones  who did not win any medals in athens in august  has never failed a drugs test. meanwhile  conte  who has been charged along with three other men of distributing illegal steroids and money laundering  is due to face trial in march.,jone file lawsuit cont marion jone file lawsuit defam balco bos victor cont follow alleg give performanceenhanc drug sydney olymp gold medallist say cont damag reput seek m £m suit cont whose compani centr dope investig make claim u televis programm three other indict februari feder grand juri varieti alleg offenc email associ press wednesday cont say stand everyth say jone three gold medal two bronz sydney lawsuit file u district court san francisco say sprinter pas lie detector test never take ban performanceenhanc drug cont statement suit ad fals malici abc televis program earlier month jone lawyer richard nichol say marion steadfastli maintain posit throughout never ever use performanceenhanc drug victor cont man face count feder indict marion jone one america decor femal athlet mr cont statement wildli contradictori mr cont chose make unsubstanti alleg televis marion jone demand take pas lie detector examin mr cont simpli credibl challeng submit lie detector procedur marion jone pas sport rule bodi iaaf take cautiou approach cont alleg contact u antidop agenc commun director nick davi say iaaf would seek contact cont inform davi stress would american author decid whether take action jone light cont televis interview world govern bodi would monitor situat close felt case answer would nation govern bodi usa track field take appropri disciplinari action ad u antidop agenc prove dilig antidop war sure like watch televis programm great interest jone investig steroid use u antidop agenc continu deni ever take illeg substanc sinc investig balco scandal although prais zinc supplement cont market jone win medal athen august never fail drug test meanwhil cont charg along three men distribut illeg steroid money launder due face trial march
800,714,music man to the oscars bill conti s job of musical director of the oscars show is not for the faint-hearted since conducting the orchestra is the ultimate plate-spinning assignment.  this year marks conti s 17th turn at the helm of the academy awards orchestra.  the excitement is a live performance as a musician   he says.  all of your colleagues  everyone in the film industry is in the theatre. all the important people.  i guess it s just a television show but we always think it s a bit more.  the orchestra strikes up more than 110 times during the average oscars show. as well as playing the presenters and winners on and off stage  it also performs during the commercial breaks to entertain the live audience in the house.   it s a very busy evening  it takes a certain amount of preparation of music  orchestrating  sketching rehearsing  before the show. but you don t know what the unexpected will be and as the musical director  it s exciting   explains conti. and much of the preparation goes into mastering scores that will never be performed.  we don t know who the winners will be. so when they say   the winner is   we have five different pieces of music in front of us  they say the name  we play the appropriate one immediately   adds conti.  the orchestra is often called upon to play when the winners ramble on too long during their acceptance speeches  despite being told to be brief by the show s producers.  the decision to drown out or  kill  the offending star with music is relayed from the director s box to the orchestra via conti s earpiece.  i don t feel good about it at all. it s not my call though   he says.  when the director says  music  the orchestra plays and he takes a long shot of the hall. we don t usually see the person speaking while his microphone is cut off.  the person that s been cut off  who s 10 feet from me  is glaring at me like it s death time.  on occasions  some stars have taken it upon themselves to send a warning shot across the bows of the musical director before they start to speak.  julia roberts  when she came on  she asked me to not get ready to play because she had so much to do   he says. conti received an oscar in 1983 for the original score of the right stuff. he also received two nominations in the original song category in 1976 for gonna fly now from rocky and in 1981 for the title song from for your eyes only.   it s a moment in the sun   he says.  when people get up there  some people  this is hard to believe  people that spend their lives in front of the camera or audiences entertaining  might get a little flustered.  but there s this moment in time when the biggest award that they could possibly get in their life has been handed to them and they re either not in control or they want to thank everyone that they ever met.   the image of the oscars telecast is one of slick presentation and smooth transitions between performances and the award categories. behind the scenes  the key players  such as conti  have a bewildering array of technical props to deal with.  there s a big script and video monitors you have to watch and there are also audio controls. i can control hearing in my ears  the left ear or the right ear - different things at different times.   i have to communicate with the director. i have a little microphone that s attached to my headset. to open up that microphone  i have a footswitch   he explains. conti s most nerve-wracking moment came during his first oscars show as musical director  in 1977  when a member of the orchestra alerted him that they could smell smoke. conti immediately told the show s director:  i start cursing and screaming  i tell him we re not going to die for this show - you must do something or i m going to climb out of this pit with 60 musicians and we re going to be home in 10 minutes.   oh no bill don t do anything   came the response.  imagine these elegantly dressed ladies and gentlemen of the orchestra  60 or so of them in the pit and while we re playing  firemen with their helmets and their hatchets crawling among us trying to find the reason for the smoke.  the smell turned out to be new paint smouldering on the music stands.  no one died  it s not a big story  but it was scary at the time   laughs conti. when the ceremony is over  the music director attends the annual governor s ball with his family.  i have a drink and relive the show   he says.  i m not for too much carousing. i go home and unwind. it takes me about a day.,music man oscar bill conti job music director oscar show faintheart sinc conduct orchestra ultim platespin assign year mark conti th turn helm academi award orchestra excit live perform musician say colleagu everyon film industri theatr import peopl guess televis show alway think bit orchestra strike time averag oscar show well play present winner stage also perform commerci break entertain live audienc hous busi even take certain amount prepar music orchestr sketch rehears show know unexpect music director excit explain conti much prepar goe master score never perform know winner say winner five differ piec music front u say name play appropri one immedi add conti orchestra often call upon play winner rambl long accept speech despit told brief show produc decis drown kill offend star music relay director box orchestra via conti earpiec feel good call though say director say music orchestra play take long shot hall usual see person speak microphon cut person cut foot glare like death time occas star take upon send warn shot across bow music director start speak julia robert come ask get readi play much say conti receiv oscar origin score right stuff also receiv two nomin origin song categori gon na fli rocki titl song eye moment sun say peopl get peopl hard believ peopl spend live front camera audienc entertain might get littl fluster moment time big award could possibl get life hand either control want thank everyon ever met imag oscar telecast one slick present smooth transit perform award categori behind scene key player conti bewild array technic prop deal big script video monitor watch also audio control control hear ear left ear right ear differ thing differ time commun director littl microphon attach headset open microphon footswitch explain conti nervewrack moment come first oscar show music director member orchestra alert could smell smoke conti immedi told show director start cur scream tell go die show must someth go climb pit musician go home minut oh bill anyth come respons imagin elegantli dress ladi gentleman orchestra pit play fireman helmet hatchet crawl among u tri find reason smoke smell turn new paint smoulder music stand one die big stori scari time laugh conti ceremoni music director attend annual governor ball famili drink reliv show say much carous go home unwind take day

805,1595,blair ready to call election tony blair seems certain to end weeks of phoney war on monday and announce there will be a general election on 5 may.  the date has been pencilled into the diaries of politicians and political journalists for many months and  despite occasional panics that the prime minister was on the verge of calling a snap poll  it has not shifted. over the weeks  there have been any number of signs that 050505 was going to be the day mr blair would go for an historic third term. and the calling of a special political cabinet meeting has only added to the belief that the announcement is imminent. the prime minister and his campaign boss alan milburn have already insisted the election will be fought on the economy and what they claim is a stark choice between labour s stability and investment against tory cuts and boom and bust.  and chancellor gordon brown has stepped into the front line of the campaign - to the relief of many of his supporters in westminster - to underline that economic message. and it is certain one of the big arguments at the centre of the election battle will be around the big parties  tax and spend policies.  during the phoney campaign  labour got into trouble over its central claim that michael howard was planning £35 bn cuts in public services. the prime minister found himself struggling to explain how a smaller  slower increase in spending planned by the tories compared to labour s plans was a cut. and it looked like the labour campaign - which was already being criticised for being thrown into defensive mode by mr howard on issues such as immigration and health - was on the rocks. then deputy conservative chairman howard flight was reported to have suggested mr howard was secretly planning even bigger  cuts .  he was sacked for his gaffe  but the damage had been done and the faltering labour campaign was back on track. a second central argument will be over taxation  with the tories claiming the chancellor has to fill a black hole at the centre of his finances and will be forced to raise taxes if labour wins again. mr brown slaps that aside  claiming his forecasts are accurate and that previous claims of looming economic disaster have proved inaccurate. as usual  the liberal democrats will have to fight to get their voice heard over the sounds of battle between the two big parties. but leader charles kennedy believes he has set out a distinctive manifesto with plans for a tax rise for the wealthiest to finance extra spending and the abolition of the council tax in favour of a local income tax. other issues are certain to play a part - immigration and asylum  the war on iraq  law and order and education  for example. but  as ever  it will be the economy that will almost certainly decide the outcome. and  whatever that outcome  2005 is set to be a far more lively  even bitter campaign than 2001 s non-event.,blair readi call elect toni blair seem certain end week phoney war monday announc gener elect may date pencil diari politician polit journalist mani month despit occasion panic prime minist verg call snap poll shift week number sign go day mr blair would go histor third term call special polit cabinet meet ad belief announc immin prime minist campaign bos alan milburn alreadi insist elect fought economi claim stark choic labour stabil invest torus cut boom bust chancellor gordon brown step front line campaign relief mani support westminst underlin econom messag certain one big argument centr elect battl around big parti tax spend polici phoney campaign labour get troubl central claim michael howard plan £ bn cut public servic prime minist found struggl explain small slow increas spend plan torus compar labour plan cut look like labour campaign alreadi criticis thrown defens mode mr howard issu immigr health rock deputi conserv chairman howard flight report suggest mr howard secretli plan even big cut sack gaff damag do falter labour campaign back track second central argument taxat torus claim chancellor fill black hole centr financ forc rais tax labour win mr brown slap asid claim forecast accur previou claim loom econom disast prove inaccur usual liber democrat fight get voic heard sound battl two big parti leader charl kennedi believ set distinct manifesto plan tax rise wealthy financ extra spend abolit council tax favour local incom tax issu certain play part immigr asylum war iraq law order educ exampl ever economi almost certainli decid outcom whatev outcom set far live even bitter campaign nonev
806,1268,watchdog probes vivendi bond sale french stock market regulator amf has filed complaints against media giant vivendi universal  its boss and another top executive.  it believes the prospectus for a bond issue was unclear and that executives may have had privileged information. amf has begun proceedings against vivendi  its chief executive jean-rene fourtou and chief operating officer jean-bernard levy. vivendi advisor deutsche bank was also the subject of a complaint filing. deutsche bank  which was responsible for selling the convertible bonds to investors  could face penalties if the complaint is upheld.  vivendi has said it believes there is  no legal basis  for the complaints. the watchdog is said to believe the executive pair were party to  privileged information  surrounding the issue of the bonds. both men bought some of the bonds  the associated press news agency reported. amf is investigating claims that the duo were aware of an interest in vivendi s us assets from investor marvin davis  at the time of the bond sale. vivendi  however  has said that the information was public knowledge as mr davis  offer for the us assets had already been rejected by vivendi s board. amf is also looking into whether the executives knew that vivendi was considering exercising its right to buy british telecom s shares in cegetel. vivendi has rejected the charge  saying the decision to buy the cegetel shares was  no more than a possibility  of which the public was perfectly aware  at the time of the bond issue. back in december  vivendi and its former chief executive jean-marie messier were each fined 1m euros ($1.3m; £690 000) by amf. the fines came after a 15-month probe into allegations that the media giant misled investors after a costly acquisition programme went wrong.,watchdog probe vivendi bond sale french stock market regul amf file complaint medium giant vivendi univers bos anoth top execut believ prospectu bond issu unclear execut may privileg inform amf begin proceed vivendi chief execut jeanren fourtou chief oper offic jeanbernard levi vivendi advisor deutsch bank also subject complaint file deutsch bank respons sell convert bond investor could face penalti complaint upheld vivendi say believ legal basi complaint watchdog say believ execut pair parti privileg inform surround issu bond men bought bond associ press news agenc report amf investig claim duo awar interest vivendi u asset investor marvin davi time bond sale vivendi howev say inform public knowledg mr davi offer u asset alreadi reject vivendi board amf also look whether execut knew vivendi consid exercis right buy british telecom share cegetel vivendi reject charg say decis buy cegetel share possibl public perfectli awar time bond issu back decemb vivendi former chief execut jeanmari messier fine m euro m £ amf fine come month probe alleg medium giant misl investor costli acquisit programm go wrong

809,2156,cherie accused of attacking bush cherie blair has been accused of criticising george w bush s policies in a private address she gave during a united states lecture tour.  the prime minister s wife is said to have praised the supreme court for overruling the white house on the legal rights of guantanamo bay detainees. the tories said she broke a convention that british political figures do not act in a partisan way when abroad. but downing street said she was speaking in her capacity as a lawyer. it said she was not expressing political opinions. mrs blair s remarks are said to have been made in a speech to law students in massachusetts. she said the decision by the us supreme court to give legal protection to two britons held at guantanamo bay was a significant victory for human rights and the international rule of law. she also described the us legal code as an outdated grandfather clock and welcomed a decision to throw out a law backed by mr bush relating to sodomy in texas.  bbc news correspondent gary o donoghue said mrs blair was likely to face further calls for restraint  since the us election is imminent.  there have been some objections from people reasonably close to the bush administration about her making these comments in their backyard just two days before a presidential election   he said.  conservatives here too have made their feelings clear.  cherie booth has always regarded herself as having an independent career. she has continued to practise as a major human rights lawyer in the courts.  it s not unusual for her to make these sorts of criticisms clear but it can be embarrassing.,cheri accus attack bush cheri blair accus criticis georg w bush polici privat address give unit state lectur tour prime minist wife say prais suprem court overrul white hous legal right guantanamo bay detaine torus say broke convent british polit figur act partisan way abroad down street say speak capac lawyer say express polit opinion mr blair remark say make speech law student massachusett say decis u suprem court give legal protect two briton held guantanamo bay signific victori human right intern rule law also describ u legal code outdat grandfath clock welcom decis throw law back mr bush relat sodomi texa bbc news correspond gari donoghu say mr blair like face call restraint sinc u elect immin object peopl reason close bush administr make comment backyard two day presidenti elect say conserv make feel clear cheri booth alway regard independ career continu practis major human right lawyer court unusu make sort critic clear embarrass
810,145,blind student  hears in colour  a blind student has developed software that turns colours into musical notes so that he can read weather maps.  victor wong  a graduate student from hong kong studying at cornell university in new york state  had to read coloured maps of the upper atmosphere as part of his research. to study  space weather  mr wong needed to explore minute fluctuations in order to create mathematical models. a number of solutions were tried  including having a colleague describe the maps and attempting to print them in braille. mr wong eventually hit upon the idea of translating individual colours into music  and enlisted the help of a computer graphics specialist and another student to do the programming work.   the images have three dimensions and i had to find a way of reading them myself   mr wong told the bbc news website.  for the sake of my own study - and for the sake of blind scientists generally - i felt it would be good to develop software that could help us to read colour images.  he tried a prototype version of the software to explore a photograph of a parrot. in order to have an exact reference to the screen  a pen and tablet device is used. the software then assigns one of 88 piano notes to individually coloured pixels - ranging from blue at the lower end of this scale to red at the upper end. mr wong says the application is still very much in its infancy and is only useful for reading images that have been created digitally.  if i took a random picture and scanned it and then used my software to recognise it  it wouldn t work that well.   mr wong has been blind from the age of seven and he thinks that having a  colour memory  makes the software more useful than it would be to a scientist who had never had any vision.  as the notes increase in pitch i know the colour s getting redder and redder  and in my mind s eye a patch of red appears.  the colour to music software has not yet been made available commercially  and mr wong believes that several people would have to work together to make it viable. but he hopes that one day it can be developed to give blind people access to photographs and other images.,blind student hear colour blind student develop softwar turn colour music note read weather map victor wong graduat student hong kong studi cornel univers new york state read colour map upper atmospher part research studi space weather mr wong need explor minut fluctuat order creat mathemat model number solut tri includ colleagu describ map attempt print braill mr wong eventu hit upon idea translat individu colour music enlist help comput graphic specialist anoth student program work imag three dimens find way read mr wong told bbc news websit sake studi sake blind scientist gener felt would good develop softwar could help u read colour imag tri prototyp version softwar explor photograph parrot order exact refer screen pen tablet devic use softwar assign one piano note individu colour pixel rang blue low end scale red upper end mr wong say applic still much infanc use read imag creat digit take random pictur scan use softwar recognis work well mr wong blind age seven think colour memori make softwar use would scientist never vision note increas pitch know colour get redder redder mind eye patch red appear colour music softwar yet make avail commerci mr wong believ sever peopl would work togeth make viabl hope one day develop give blind peopl access photograph imag

the fastest time in the world this season.  fought off fellow briton tim abeyie to take the men s 200m in a personal best of 20.88.  continued her outstanding start to the season  beating a strong international field  which included two-time olympic 100m hurdles bronze medallist melissa morrison  to claim the women s 60m hurdles. the 25-year-old briton clocked 7.98 seconds while pre-european championships favourite russian irina shevchenko finished down in sixth. ethiopia s  failed in her bid to smash compatriot berhane adere s world 3 000m record but still won the event in emphatic style. the olympic 5 000m champion was inside record pace but dropped off over the final third  finishing in eight minutes  33.05 seconds - the fourth fastest time ever recorded for the event. britain s jo pavey bravely decided to go with defar as she strode away from the field and took second in a season s best 8:41.43. kenyan  also missed out on the indoor 1500m world record  which hicham el guerrouj has held for the last eight years.  lagat settled for silver behind el guerrouj in athens and was almost four seconds short of the moroccan s world best  clocking 3:35.27 in birmingham. and  was still struggling to find his form after the death of his fiancee this year. the olympic 10 000m champion had comfortably led the men s two mile race after his younger brother tariku had set the pace. but fellow ethiopian  appeared ominously on bekele s shoulder with two laps to go before surging past him at the bell to win in 8:14.28. jamaican  made the most of a blistering start to take the men s 400m title in 45.91 seconds. world indoor champion  alleyne francique  faded badly and finished in fourth while american duo jerry harris and james davis took second and third respectively. swede  showed her class in the long jump as she stole top spot from jade johnson with the very last jump of the competition. the olympic heptathlon gold medallist reached 6.66m to better johnson s mark of 6.52m -

817,342,u2 s desire to be number one u2  who have won three prestigious grammy awards for their hit vertigo  are stubbornly clinging to their status as one of the biggest bands in the world.  the most popular groups in the history of rock all have several things in common. the music must be inspired and appeal across generations and be distinctive  if not always groundbreaking. but such success is down to more than music. they have to be compelling performers  charismatic and intelligent enough to make good decisions and keep their feet on the ground. they also have to want it. they have to want to be the biggest band ever and not stop wanting it. the beatles had it  the rolling stones still have it  rem hold onto it and queen were it in a catsuit. and u2 have it in spades  and keep churning it out. their new album  how to dismantle an atomic bomb  comes 28 years after the schoolfriends got together in dublin and 17 years after the joshua tree cemented their place on the all-time rock a-list.  they may have lost some of the edginess and raw  youthful force that propelled them to the top  but they have lost none of the desire or ability to craft songs and albums.  vertigo  the first single from the new album  went straight into the uk singles chart at number one  knocking eminem off the top spot and giving them their 26th top 10 hit.  the challenge is to be bigger and bolder and better - to make records the whole world will listen to   bono recently said. drummer larry mullen jr echoed those sentiments:  we re very competitive - we want to be on the radio  have big singles. we don t want to be thought of as a veteran band.  the band have done  everything in their considerable powers  to ensure they remain the biggest band in the world  according to q magazine editor paul rees.   this makes them hugely determined and formidable.  he added:  they are equally determined to push themselves to make music that continues to stand up.  as such  they ve constantly re-invented and challenged themselves. they are  perhaps  alone as the only rock band that has got better with age.  the other key ingredient was the fact they were highly organised  mr rees said.  they do everything in the right way.  the group were born when mullen put an appeal for bandmates on a high school notice board  attracting fellow pupils paul hewson (bono  vocals)  adam clayton (bass)  david evans (the edge  guitar) and his brother dick.  dick evans soon dropped out and the four-piece were known as the feedback and the hype before settling on u2.  by 1978  they had won a talent contest and got noticed by a manager  paul mcguinness.  they were brilliant  but very coarse   mcguinness recently said.  in a way  they were doing exactly what they do now. only badly.  they struggled to attract record company attention  later being described as  pretty damn average  and  strange and eerie  by scouts who saw them live. they released two ireland-only singles  which topped the national charts in 1979 and 1980  leading to a deal with island and their debut album boy. the stadium-filling  anthemic sound was u2 s aim from the start  and their third album  war  saw them make the breakthrough on both sides of the atlantic  going to number one in the uk and 12 in the us. songs like sunday bloody sunday and new year s day brought success and an image as a political and spiritual band - which bono rejected as a cliche.  his stage performances - which included flag-waving  speaker-climbing and drum-throwing - earned him a reputation as an electric performer  and their appearance at 1985 s live aid is widely seen as sealing their global stardom.  in 1987  the joshua tree broke sales records and saw the band reach the height of their powers with hits including where the streets have no name  i still haven t found what i m looking for and with or without you. those songs took the band s epic  atmospheric sound to a simple  powerful and popular pinnacle. the end of the decade marked a crucial point for the band -

818,20,games maker fights for survival one of britain s largest independent game makers  argonaut games  has been put up for sale.  the london-based company behind the harry potter games has sacked about 100 employees due to a severe cash crisis. the administrators told bbc news online that selling argonaut was the only way to save it as it had run out of cash. argonaut warned that it was low on cash 10 days ago when its shares were suspended from trading on the london stock exchange.  argonaut has been making games for some 18 years and is one the largest independent games developers in the uk.  along with its headquarters in north london  it operates studios in cambridge and sheffield. argonaut was behind the harry potter games which provided a healthy flow of cash into the company. but  like all software developers  argonaut needed a constant flow of deals with publishers. signs that it was in trouble emerged in august  when it warned it was heading for losses of £6m in the financial year due to delays in signing new contracts for games. those new deals were further delayed  leading argonaut to warn in mid-october that it was running out of cash and suspend trading of its shares on the london stock exchange. as part of cost-cutting measures  some 100 employees were fired.  when the news about the £6m loss came out  we knew there were going to be redundancies   said jason parkinson  one of the game developers sacked by argonaut.  a lot of people suspected that argonaut had been in trouble for some time   he told bbc news online. mr parkinson said staff were told the job losses were necessary to save argonaut from going under. at the start of the year  the company employed 268 people. after the latest round of cuts there are 80 staff at argonaut headquarters in edgware in north london  with 17 at its morpheme offices in kentish town  london  and 22 at the just add monsters base in cambridge.  argonaut called in administrators david rubin & partners on friday to find a way to rescue the company from collapse. it spent the weekend going over the company s finances and concluded that the only way to save the business was to put it up for sale. the administrator told bbc news online that the costs of restructuing would be too high  partly because of the overheads from the company s four premises across the uk. it said it was hopeful that it could save some 110 jobs by selling the business  saying it had had expressions of interest from several quarters and were looking for a quick sale. the administrator said it would ensure that staff made redundant would receive any wages  redundancy or holiday pay due to them  hopefully by christmas.,game maker fight surviv one britain large independ game maker argonaut game put sale londonbas compani behind harri potter game sack employe due sever cash crisi administr told bbc news onlin sell argonaut way save run cash argonaut warn low cash day ago share suspend trade london stock exchang argonaut make game year one large independ game develop uk along headquart north london oper studio cambridg sheffield argonaut behind harri potter game provid healthi flow cash compani like softwar develop argonaut need constant flow deal publish sign troubl emerg august warn head loss £m financi year due delay sign new contract game new deal delay lead argonaut warn midoctob run cash suspend trade share london stock exchang part costcut measur employe fire news £m loss come knew go redund say jason parkinson one game develop sack argonaut lot peopl suspect argonaut troubl time told bbc news onlin mr parkinson say staff told job loss necessari save argonaut go start year compani employ peopl late round cut staff argonaut headquart edgwar north london morphem offic kentish town london add monster base cambridg argonaut call administr david rubin partner friday find way rescu compani collaps spent weekend go compani financ conclud way save busi put sale administr told bbc news onlin cost restructu would high partli overhead compani four premis across uk say hope could save job sell busi say express interest sever quarter look quick sale administr say would ensur staff make redund would receiv wage redund holiday pay due hope christma
819,1967,kuznetsova  failed a drugs test  us open champion svetlana kuznetsova has tested positive for a banned drug  according to belgian authorities.  belgian sports minister claude eerdekens said that the russian world number five tested positive for the stimulant ephedrine on 19 december. kuznetsova was playing in an exhibition event in charleroi at the time. eerdekens said:  there is a problem. ephedrine was discovered. she remains innocent until proved guilty. she can ask for it to be tested again.  the situation remains unclear as the tournament was not commissioned by the world anti-doping agency (wada)  the international tennis federation (itf) or the women s tennis accosiation (wta). the test was carried out by regional belgian authorities and kuznetsova has not yet been able to have a b sample tested.  speaking at the australian open on monday  before eerdekens identified her  kuznetsova said:  i m not worried. i m not using anything to push myself.  i have not been notified of any positive test  and i think it is unfair that it s come out the way it did.  eerdekens said that confirmation of the findings was sent last friday to the player s address in spain  as well as to the belgian prosecutors  office and the belgian and russian tennis federations. he conceded kuznetsova might have taken a medicine which contained the banned substance.  we have simply stated a fact   he said.  it is for the federation concerned to impose the disciplinary measures after a procedure that respects the defence.   either the ephedrine was taken to improve her performance or it is because she took some medicine legitimately to cure an infection.  however  kuznetsova s naming was condemned by russian tennis chief shamil tarpishchev.  first of all  this belgian sports minister has broken every ethical rule in the book by naming a player without any proof of wrongdoing  without any basic evidence   tarpishchev said.  we all know the basic principle in doping cases. if there is a positive sample  then they should notify the international tennis federation (itf) as well as the national federation within three days   he said.  this is not the case here. as of today we have not received any statement from the doping officials  nor did the itf.  today i called the itf headquarters and they told me they know nothing about it.  if wada (the world anti-doping agency) was behind the testing  then we would also have known something by now.  otherwise  all these looks to me as pure fiction and fabrication of the facts.,kuznetsova fail drug test u open champion svetlana kuznetsova test posit ban drug accord belgian author belgian sport minist claud eerdeken say russian world number five test posit stimul ephedrin decemb kuznetsova play exhibit event charleroi time eerdeken say problem ephedrin discov remain innoc prove guilti ask test situat remain unclear tournament commiss world antidop agenc wada intern tenni feder itf woman tenni accosi wta test carri region belgian author kuznetsova yet abl b sampl test speak australian open monday eerdeken identifi kuznetsova say worri use anyth push notifi posit test think unfair come way eerdeken say confirm find sent last friday player address spain well belgian prosecutor offic belgian russian tenni feder conced kuznetsova might take medicin contain ban substanc simpli state fact say feder concern impos disciplinari measur procedur respect defenc either ephedrin take improv perform take medicin legitim cure infect howev kuznetsova name condemn russian tenni chief shamil tarpishchev first belgian sport minist broken everi ethic rule book name player without proof wrongdo without basic evid tarpishchev say know basic principl dope case posit sampl notifi intern tenni feder itf well nation feder within three day say case today receiv statement dope offici itf today call itf headquart told know noth wada world antidop agenc behind test would also know someth otherwis look pure fiction fabric fact
820,1589,pre-poll clash on tax and spend labour and the tories have clashed over tax and spending plans as the row over gordon brown s budget turned into a full scale pre-election battle.  tony blair claimed a tory government would  cut  £35bn from public services hitting schools  hospitals and police. tory chairman liam fox accused labour of  at best misrepresentation at worst a downright lie  and said the  smear  tactics were a sign of desperation. the lib dems accused mr brown of ducking the issue of council tax rises.  appearing together at a labour poster launch  the prime minister hailed his chancellor s  brilliant  performance. and he claimed the tories would cut £35bn from public services  which was the equivalent of sacking every doctor and teacher in the uk.  the tories said they would not cut spending but agreed public spending would increase more slowly under their plans - leading to a total of £33.5bn less spending than that anticipated by labour by 2011. but they say not a single doctor  teacher or nurse will be cut. dr fox said:  we have said we will be spending more  year on year over and above inflation.  and to call that a cut is at best a misrepresentation  at worst a downright lie.   tory shadow chancellor oliver letwin also predicted mr brown would have to raise taxes by £10bn or £11bn if labour was re-elected because he was borrowing and spending too much. for the lib dems  vince cable said the chancellor had failed to deal with the  looming problems  of revaluation of council tax bands which he argued would result in  massive increases  for some. mr brown and mr blair staged a show of unity on thursday morning  the day after the chancellor delivered a record-breaking ninth budget.  mr cable said taxation as a share of the economy would go up under all three of the main parties. the chancellor meanwhile insisted his spending plans were  affordable . in wednesday s budget  mr brown doubled the level at which homebuyers pay stamp duty  unveiled a rise in child tax credit and a £200 council tax refund for over-65s. defending the plans  he told today:  i will take no risks with the stability of the economy.  all our spending plans announced yesterday [wednesday]  including what we can do for pensioners  as well as for young families and on stamp duty and inheritance tax  all these are costed and affordable.  in a further sign  if any were needed  that the election is approaching  the house of commons authorities have formally told mps their offices will be  deep cleaned  during the three-week poll campaign. mr blair has yet to name the day - but it is widely expected to be 5 may.,prepol clash tax spend labour torus clash tax spend plan row gordon brown budget turn full scale preelect battl toni blair claim torus govern would cut £bn public servic hit school hospit polic torus chairman liam fox accus labour best misrepresent bad downright lie say smear tactic sign desper lib dem accus mr brown duck issu council tax rise appear togeth labour poster launch prime minist hail chancellor brilliant perform claim torus would cut £bn public servic equival sack everi doctor teacher uk torus say would cut spend agre public spend would increas slowli plan lead total £bn less spend anticip labour say singl doctor teacher nurs cut dr fox say say spend year year inflat call cut best misrepresent bad downright lie torus shadow chancellor oliv letwin also predict mr brown would rais tax £bn £bn labour reelect borrow spend much lib dem vinc cabl say chancellor fail deal loom problem revalu council tax band argu would result massiv increas mr brown mr blair stage show uniti thursday morn day chancellor deliv recordbreak ninth budget mr cabl say taxat share economi would go three main parti chancellor meanwhil insist spend plan afford wednesday budget mr brown doubl level homebuy pay stamp duti unveil rise child tax credit £ council tax refund over defend plan told today take risk stabil economi spend plan announc yesterday wednesday includ pension well young famili stamp duti inherit tax cost afford sign need elect approach hous common author formal told mp offic deep clean threeweek poll campaign mr blair yet name day wide expect may

825,1814,yukos unit buyer faces loan claim the owners of embattled russian oil giant yukos are to ask the buyer of its former production unit to pay back a $900m (£479m) loan.  state-owned rosneft bought the yugansk unit for $9.3bn in a sale forced by russia to part settle a $27.5bn tax claim against yukos. yukos  owner menatep group says it will ask rosneft to repay a loan that yugansk had secured on its assets. rosneft already faces a similar $540m repayment demand from foreign banks. legal experts said rosneft s purchase of yugansk would include such obligations.  the pledged assets are with rosneft  so it will have to pay real money to the creditors to avoid seizure of yugansk assets   said moscow-based us lawyer jamie firestone  who is not connected to the case. menatep group s managing director tim osborne told the reuters news agency:  if they default  we will fight them where the rule of law exists under the international arbitration clauses of the credit.   rosneft officials were unavailable for comment. but the company has said it intends to take action against menatep to recover some of the tax claims and debts owed by yugansk. yukos had filed for bankruptcy protection in a us court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm. the sale went ahead in december and yugansk was sold to a little-known shell company which in turn was bought by rosneft. yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder mikhail khodorkovsky and has vowed to sue any participant in the sale.,yuko unit buyer face loan claim owner embattl russian oil giant yuko ask buyer former product unit pay back m £m loan stateown rosneft bought yugansk unit bn sale forc russia part settl bn tax claim yuko yuko owner menatep group say ask rosneft repay loan yugansk secur asset rosneft alreadi face similar m repay demand foreign bank legal expert say rosneft purchas yugansk would includ oblig pledg asset rosneft pay real money creditor avoid seizur yugansk asset say moscowbas u lawyer jami fireston connect case menatep group manag director tim osborn told reuter news agenc default fight rule law exist intern arbitr claus credit rosneft offici unavail comment compani say intend take action menatep recov tax claim debt owe yugansk yuko file bankruptci protect u court attempt prevent forc sale main product arm sale go ahead decemb yugansk sell littleknown shell compani turn bought rosneft yuko claim downfal punish polit ambit founder mikhail khodorkovski vow sue particip sale

827,1229,savvy searchers fail to spot ads internet search engine users are an odd mix of naive and sophisticated  suggests a report into search habits.  the report by the us pew research center reveals that 87% of searchers usually find what they were looking for when using a search engine. it also shows that few can spot the difference between paid-for results and organic ones. the report reveals that 84% of net users say they regularly use google  ask jeeves  msn and yahoo when online.  almost 50% of those questioned said they would trust search engines much less  if they knew information about who paid for results was being hidden. according to figures gathered by the pew researchers the average users spends about 43 minutes per month carrying out 34 separate searches and looks at 1.9 webpages for each hunt. a significant chunk of net users  36%  carry out a search at least weekly and 29% of those asked only look every few weeks. for 44% of those questioned  the information they are looking for is critical to what they are doing and is information they simply have to find.  search engine users also tend to be very loyal and once they have found a site they feel they can trust tend to stick with it. according to pew research 44% of searchers use just a single search engine  48% use two or three and a small number  7%  consult more than three sites. tony macklin  spokesman for ask jeeves  said the results reflected its own research which showed that people use different search engines because the way the sites gather information means they can provide different results for the same query. despite this liking for search sites half of those questioned said they could get the same information via other routes. a small number  17%  said they wouldn t really miss search engines if they did not exist. the remaining 33% said they could not live without search sites. more than two-thirds of those questioned  68%  said they thought that the results they were presented with were a fair and unbiased selection of the information on a topic that can be found on the net. alongside the growing sophistication of net users is a lack of awareness about paid-for results that many search engines provide alongside lists of websites found by indexing the web. of those asked  62% were unaware that someone has paid for some of the results they see when they carry out a search. only 18% of all searchers say they can tell which results are paid for and which are not. said the pew report:  this finding is ironic  since nearly half of all users say they would stop using search engines if they thought engines were not being clear about how they presented paid results.  commenting mr macklin said sponsored results must be clearly marked and though they might help with some queries user testing showed that people need to be able to spot the difference.,savvi searcher fail spot ad internet search engin user odd mix naiv sophist suggest report search habit report u pew research center reveal searcher usual find look use search engin also show spot differ paidfor result organ one report reveal net user say regularli use googl ask jeev msn yahoo onlin almost question say would trust search engin much less knew inform paid result hidden accord figur gather pew research averag user spend minut per month carri separ search look webpag hunt signific chunk net user carri search least weekli ask look everi week question inform look critic inform simpli find search engin user also tend loyal found site feel trust tend stick accord pew research searcher use singl search engin use two three small number consult three site toni macklin spokesman ask jeev say result reflect research show peopl use differ search engin way site gather inform mean provid differ result queri despit like search site half question say could get inform via rout small number say realli miss search engin exist remain say could live without search site twothird question say thought result present fair unbias select inform topic found net alongsid grow sophist net user lack awar paidfor result mani search engin provid alongsid list websit found index web ask unawar someon paid result see carri search searcher say tell result paid say pew report find iron sinc nearli half user say would stop use search engin thought engin clear present paid result comment mr macklin say sponsor result must clearli mark though might help queri user test show peopl need abl spot differ

that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music  movies and software. since the first successful file-sharing network napster was forced to close down  the entertainment industry has been nervous and critical of p2p technology  blaming it for falling sales and piracy. but that is going to change very soon  according to the panel.  the music and film industries have started some big legal cases against owners of legitimate p2p networks - which are not illegal in themselves - and of individuals accused of distributing pirated content over networks. but they have slowly realised that p2p is a good way to distribute content  said travis kalanick  founder and chairman of p2p network red swoosh  and soon they are all going to want a slice of it. they are just waiting to come up with  business models  that work for them  which includes digital rights management and copy-protection standards.  but  until the legal actions are resolved  experimentation with p2p cannot not happen  said michael weiss  president of streamcast networks. remembering the furore around vcrs when they first came out  mr weiss said:  old media always tries to stop new media.  when they can t stop it  they try to control it. then they figure out how to make money and they always make a lot of money.  once the courts decided that the vcr in itself was not an illegal technology  the film studios turned it into an extremely lucrative business. in august 2004  the san francisco-based us court of appeals ruled in favour of grokster and streamcast  two file-sharing networks. the court said they were essentially in the same position that sony was in the 1980s vcr battle  and said that the networks themselves could not be deemed as illegal.  p2p networks usually do not rely on dedicated servers for the transfer of files. instead it uses direct connections between computers - or clients. there are now many different types of p2p systems than work in different ways. p2p nets can be used to share any kind of file  like photos  free software  licensed music and any other digital content. the bbc has already decided to embrace the technology. it aims to offer most of its own programmes for download this year and it will use p2p technology to distribute them. the files would be locked seven days after a programme aired making rights management easier to control. but the technology is still demonised and misunderstood by many. the global entertainment industry says more than 2.6 billion copyrighted music files are downloaded every month  and about half a million films are downloaded a day. legal music download services  like apple itunes  napster  have rushed into the music marketplace to try and lure file-sharers away from free content. sales of legally-downloaded songs grew tenfold in 2004  with 200 million tracks bought online in the us and europe in 12 months  the ifpi reported this week. but such download services are very different from p2p networks  not least because of the financial aspect.  there are several money-spinning models that could turn p2p into a golden egg for commercial entertainment companies. paid-for-pass-along  in which firms receive money each time a file is shared  along with various drm solutions and advertiser-based options are all being considered.  we see there are going to be different models for commoditising p2p   said marc morgenstern  vice president of anti-piracy firm overpeer.   consumers are hungry for it and we will discover new models together   agreed mr morgenstern. but many net users will continue to ignore the entertainment industry s potential controlling grip on content and p2p technology by continuing to use it for their own creations. unsigned bands  for example  use p2p networks to distribute their music effectively  which also draws the attention of record companies looking for new artists to sign.  increasingly  what you are seeing on p2p is consumer-created content   said derek broes  from microsoft.  they will probably pay an increasing role in helping p2p spread   he said. looking into p2p s future  file sharing is just the beginning for p2p networks  as far as mr broes is concerned.  once some of these issues are resolved  you are going to see aggressive movement to protect content  but also in ways that are unimaginable now   he said.  file-sharing is the tip of the iceberg.,peertop net stay peertop pp network stay verg exploit commerci medium firm say panel industri expert sever highprofil legal case fileshar resolv year firm keen tri make money pp

832,1128,my memories of marley...  to mark the 60th anniversary of the birth of reggae star bob marley  rob partridge - marley s former head of press at island records - remembers the man behind the legend.  partridge worked with marley from 1977 until the jamaican musician s death in 1981.  :  i joined island records in 1977 and the first week i was there i worked on his show at the rainbow theatre. it was one of the last dates he did in london.   : the album exodus came out in 1977 and that provided five hits and confirmed his global superstar status.  by 1979 he was the biggest touring attraction in the world. i remember going to see dates in milan and turin and they were enormous concerts.   : bob was one of the most mesmeric people i ve ever had the privilege to work with.  he must have had an iron will to succeed. bob was a very driven individual. you realised from the start there was a manifest destiny within him that he believed in. he didn t suffer fools gladly. at the risk of stating the obvious  he was an extraordinary song writer and his stage act was perhaps the greatest i ve ever seen. i saw him many times.   :  i recall in 1978 he came to the uk for top of the pops and a daily mirror journalist did a half-hour interview. it was interrupted to do a rehearsal. he came back into the dressing room to resume the interview but saw a world cup match on tv.   he sat down in front of the tv and after 10 minutes it was obvious he wasn t going to move. that was the end of it. the mirror had a very truncated interview.  the last time i saw him was in london in 1980. i arranged for him to play four days of football indoors in fulham.  bob was a good player. we are talking about jamaican-style football. he was an attacking midfield player. his team assembled wherever his gigs were. we played in brazil against some world cup-winning players.   : it was always a struggle for him to connect with black america. reggae did not correspond with disco in the 70s. but bob in the 1990s became one of the great icons in america and the third world.  in 1991  ten years after his death  he sold more records than at any time during his life.  we saw black america taking bob into their hearts for the first time.   :  bob  in worldwide terms  is the greatest music star there has ever been. if you went to africa he would be recognised everywhere  in places john lennon or elvis wouldn t be.  no disrespect to the other artists but a case can be made for him as the greatest  the best and the most influential artist in popular music.   : well 1981 was to be the year he toured africa with stevie wonder. he had only performed in zimbabwe and guinea before.  of course the 1981 tour never happened  but the whole of africa would have embraced him. we can t speculate but he was at the height of his powers and just 36 years old. i had no sense his career was going to go downhill.   :  bob was endlessly optimistic about the way africa would turn out. he realised that nothing was perfect but he had total belief in the power of mankind.  i m sure if he were alive today he would believe africa would firstly become politically free and secondly be able to defeat the aids epidemic.   :  the final tune of his final album was redemption song - one of the most incredible classics of all time.,memori marley mark th anniversari birth regga star bob marley rob partridg marley former head press island record rememb man behind legend partridg work marley jamaican musician death join island record first week work show rainbow theatr one last date london album exodu come provid five hit confirm global superstar statu big tour attract world rememb go see date milan turin enorm concert bob one mesmer peopl ever privileg work must iron succeed bob driven individu realis start manifest destini within believ suffer fool gladli risk state obviou extraordinari song writer stage act perhap great ever see saw mani time recal come uk top pop daili mirror journalist halfhour interview interrupt rehears come back dress room resum interview saw world cup match tv sat front tv minut obviou go move end mirror truncat interview last time saw london arrang play four day footbal indoor fulham bob good player talk jamaicanstyl footbal attack midfield player team assembl wherev gig play brazil world cupwin player alway struggl connect black america regga correspond disco s bob s becam one great icon america third world ten year death sell record time life saw black america take bob heart first time bob worldwid term great music star ever go africa would recognis everywher place john lennon elvi disrespect artist case make great best influenti artist popular music well year tour africa stevi wonder perform zimbabw guinea cours tour never happen whole africa would embrac specul height power year old sen career go go downhil bob endlessli optimist way africa would turn realis noth perfect total belief power mankind sure aliv today would believ africa would firstli becom polit free secondli abl defeat aid epidem final tune final album redempt song one incred classic time

837,200,card fraudsters  targeting web  new safeguards on credit and debit card payments in shops has led fraudsters to focus on internet and phone payments  an anti-fraud agency has said.  anti-fraud consultancy retail decisions says  card-not-present  fraud  where goods are paid for online or by phone  has risen since the start of 2005. the introduction of  chip and pin  cards has tightened security for transactions on the high street. but the clampdown has caused fraudsters to change tack  retail decisions said.  the introduction of chip and pin cards aimed to cut down on credit card fraud in stores by asking shoppers to verify their identity with a confidential personal pin number  instead of a signature. retail decisions chief executive carl clump told the bbc that there was  no doubt  that chip and pin would  reduce card fraud in the card-present environment .  however  it is important to monitor what happens in the card-not-present environment as fraudsters will turn their attention to the internet  mail order  telephone order and interactive tv   he said.  we have seen a 22% uplift in card-not-present fraud here in the uk... since the start of the year.  fraud doesn t just disappear  it mutates to the next weakest link in the chain   he said.  retail decisions  survey on the implementation of chip and pin found that shoppers had adapted easily to the new system  but that banks  performance in distributing the new cards had been patchy  at best.  the main issue is that not everyone has the pins they need   said mr clump. nearly two thirds - 65% - of the 1 000 people interviewed said they had used chip and pin to make payments. of these  83% were happy with the experience  though nearly a quarter said they struggled to remember their pin number. however  only 34% said they had received replacement cards with the necessary  chip  technology from all their card providers. furthermore  16% said that none of their cards had been replaced  while 30% said only some had. uk shoppers spent £5.3bn on plastic cards in 2003  the last full year for which figures are available from the association of payment clearing services (apacs). altogether  card scams on uk-issued cards totalled £402.4m in 2003. card-not-present fraud rose an annual 6% to £116.4m  making it the biggest category even then. within this  internet fraud totalled £43m  apacs  figures show.,card fraudster target web new safeguard credit debit card payment shop lead fraudster focu internet phone payment antifraud agenc say antifraud consult retail decis say cardnotpres fraud good paid onlin phone risen sinc start introduct chip pin card tighten secur transact high street clampdown caus fraudster chang tack retail decis say introduct chip pin card aim cut credit card fraud store ask shopper verifi ident confidenti person pin number instead signatur retail decis chief execut carl clump told bbc doubt chip pin would reduc card fraud cardpres environ howev import monitor happen cardnotpres environ fraudster turn attent internet mail order telephon order interact tv say see uplift cardnotpres fraud uk sinc start year fraud disappear mutat next weak link chain say retail decis survey implement chip pin found shopper adapt easili new system bank perform distribut new card patchi best main issu everyon pin need say mr clump nearli two third peopl interview say use chip pin make payment happi experi though nearli quarter say struggl rememb pin number howev say receiv replac card necessari chip technolog card provid furthermor say none card replac say uk shopper spent £bn plastic card last full year figur avail associ payment clear servic apac altogeth card scam ukissu card total £m cardnotpres fraud rise annual £m make big categori even within internet fraud total £m apac figur show

839,1817,blair and blunkett sheffield trip tony blair is to join home secretary david blunkett in a visit to sheffield on thursday.  mr blunkett s conduct is being looked at to establish whether he abused his position in relation to his ex-lover. the parliamentary standards watchdog is looking at his decision to give kimberly quinn free rail tickets. he is also being investigated over the visa application of mrs quinn s ex-nanny. the visit to sheffield will be seen as a show of unity by mr blair.  on wednesday during prime minister s questions  tory leader michael howard went on the offensive over comments mr blunkett is alleged to have made in a new biography. he is understood to have made a series of criticisms about his cabinet colleagues from the prime minister down. mr howard said mr blunkett had complained he had inherited a  giant mess  when he took over at the home office from jack straw  now foreign secretary. the tory leader went on:  he doesn t stop there: he thinks the culture secretary s weak; he thinks the trade secretary doesn t think strategically and he thinks the education secretary hasn t developed as expected.  he says the prime minister doesn t like being told the truth and the chancellor - no doubt the prime minister will agree with this - is a bully.  mr blair retorted voters remembered the record of a government and no comments by politicians.  the home secretary has already admitted he was wrong to give the two first class tickets  given to him as an mp  to mrs quinn and has since paid the £180 back. he has apologised for  a genuine mistake  and says he will write to the watchdog to answer further questions. the rail tickets are meant to help mps  spouses get between westminster and their constituencies. after his inquiry  parliamentary watchdog sir philip mawer will report to the commons standards and privileges committee  the group of mps who will recommend to the full house of commons what action - if any - should be taken against mr blunkett.  the separate inquiry by ex-senior civil servant sir alan budd is investigating whether the home secretary helped fast-track a bid by mrs quinn s nanny  leoncia casalme  to stay in the uk. last week  mr blunkett won the first round of a high court battle with mrs quinn for access to her son. mr blunkett declined to comment about his own position  saying the inquiry was under way and the high court had stressed his right to privacy did not affect his job in improving security and stability. downing street has stressed mr blair s support for the home secretary.,blair blunkett sheffield trip toni blair join home secretari david blunkett visit sheffield thursday mr blunkett conduct look establish whether abus posit relat exlov parliamentari standard watchdog look decis give kimberli quinn free rail ticket also investig visa applic mr quinn exnanni visit sheffield see show uniti mr blair wednesday prime minist question torus leader michael howard go offens comment mr blunkett alleg make new biographi understood make seri critic cabinet colleagu prime minist mr howard say mr blunkett complain inherit giant mess take home offic jack straw foreign secretari torus leader go stop think cultur secretari weak think trade secretari think strateg think educ secretari develop expect say prime minist like told truth chancellor doubt prime minist agre bulli mr blair retort voter rememb record govern comment politician home secretari alreadi admit wrong give two first class ticket give mp mr quinn sinc paid £ back apologis genuin mistak say write watchdog answer question rail ticket meant help mp spous get westminst constitu inquiri parliamentari watchdog sir philip mawer report common standard privileg committe group mp recommend full hous common action take mr blunkett separ inquiri exsenior civil servant sir alan budd investig whether home secretari help fasttrack bid mr quinn nanni leoncia casalm stay uk last week mr blunkett first round high court battl mr quinn access son mr blunkett declin comment posit say inquiri way high court stress right privaci affect job improv secur stabil down street stress mr blair support home secretari

841,2119,blair  pressing us on climate  tony blair is pressing the us to cut greenhouse gases despite its unwillingness to sign the kyoto protocol  downing street has indicated.  officials have confirmed climate change was discussed when influential senator john mccain recently visited mr blair. climate change was an issue the prime minister  wanted to progress  during the uk s presidency of the g8 and eu in 2005  said a spokesman. but he played down reports mr blair was considering a new us-friendly treaty.  according to the times  the uk leader wants to end us isolation with a  kyoto-lite  agreement on the scale and nature of the threat from climate change. he is said to have discussed the idea with mr mccain during his time at number 10. the prime minister is said to believe the united states  refusal to sign the kyoto protocol on emissions is undermining other countries  resolve to cut carbon dioxide production. so far the us has refused to sign up to the kyoto treaty - which aims to cut emissions - branding it politically motivated and not based on science. president bush s advisers have repeatedly denied global warming is taking place.  europe  which disputes the claim  has also signalled it wants to press ahead with talks about longer term climate change action in a way which involves both the united states and developing countries. mr blair s reported treaty would also establish an international programme to develop technology needed for renewable energy and the reduction of carbon emissions  says the times. but there is still apparently  little prospect  of america agreeing to cut emissions  which could further provoke environmental campaigners already angry at the lack of progress. mr blair was left blushing on wednesday when it emerged his manifesto target of a 20% cut to the 1990 greenhouse gas level by 2010 was set to be missed.,blair press u climat toni blair press u cut greenhous gase despit unwilling sign kyoto protocol down street indic offici confirm climat chang discus influenti senat john mccain recent visit mr blair climat chang issu prime minist want progress uk presid g eu say spokesman play report mr blair consid new usfriendli treati accord time uk leader want end u isol kyotolit agreement scale natur threat climat chang say discus idea mr mccain time number prime minist say believ unit state refus sign kyoto protocol emiss undermin countri resolv cut carbon dioxid product far u refus sign kyoto treati aim cut emiss brand polit motiv base scienc presid bush advis repeatedli deni global warm take place europ disput claim also signal want press ahead talk longer term climat chang action way involv unit state develop countri mr blair report treati would also establish intern programm develop technolog need renew energi reduct carbon emiss say time still appar littl prospect america agre cut emiss could provok environment campaign alreadi angri lack progress mr blair left blush wednesday emerg manifesto target cut greenhous ga level set miss
842,1486,few ready  for information act thousands of public bodies are ill-prepared for the freedom of information act  due to come into force next month  because of government failures  say mps.  from next month anyone will have the power to demand information from a range of public bodies - from whitehall departments to doctors  surgeries. but an all-party committee said it was  not confident  many would be ready. it blamed the department for constitutional affairs for a  lack of consistent leadership .  the act comes into effect in england  wales and northern ireland  on 1 january while similar measures are being brought in at the same time in scotland. it provides the public with a right of access to information held by about 100 000 public bodies  subject to various exemptions.  but the government department responsible for implementing the change suffered from an  unusually high turnover  of staff within the department  which had  seriously interfered  with its work  said the constitutional affairs select committee. it said  despite four years of preparations  some local authorities and parts of the health sector were still not ready. the dca had  failed  to provide early guidance on technical matters and shown a  lack of consistent leadership   the mps found. committee chairman alan beith said:  the dca has had four years to prepare for freedom of information  but with less than a month to go it appears that some bodies may not be well enough prepared.  our report shows that in the past support and guidance from the dca  which has overall responsibility for guiding the public sector through the process of implementation for the freedom of information regime  has been lacking.  a spokesman for the dca said:  the dca has provided - and will continue to provide - strong  clear leadership.  it has delivered a simple  liberal fees regime  guidance on the act which has been widely praised  and expert networks of staff working on freedom of information implementation.,readi inform act thousand public bodi illprepar freedom inform act due come forc next month govern failur say mp next month anyon power demand inform rang public bodi whitehal depart doctor surgeri allparti committe say confid mani would readi blame depart constitut affair lack consist leadership act come effect england wale northern ireland januari similar measur brought time scotland provid public right access inform held public bodi subject variou exempt govern depart respons implement chang suffer unusu high turnov staff within depart serious interf work say constitut affair select committe say despit four year prepar local author part health sector still readi dca fail provid earli guidanc technic matter show lack consist leadership mp found committe chairman alan beith say dca four year prepar freedom inform less month go appear bodi may well enough prepar report show past support guidanc dca overal respons guid public sector process implement freedom inform regim lack spokesman dca say dca provid continu provid strong clear leadership deliv simpl liber fee regim guidanc act wide prais expert network staff work freedom inform implement
843,2095,cyber crime booms in 2004 the last 12 months have seen a dramatic growth in almost every security threat that plague windows pcs.  the count of known viruses broke the 100 000 barrier and the number of new viruses grew by more than 50%. similarly phishing attempts  in which conmen try to trick people into handing over confidential data  are recording growth rates of more than 30% and attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated. also on the increase are the number of networks of remotely controlled computers  called bot nets  used by malicious hackers and conmen to carry out many different cyber crimes.  one of the biggest changes of 2004 was the waning influence of the boy hackers keen to make a name by writing a fast-spreading virus  said kevin hogan  senior manager in symantec s security response group. although teenage virus writers will still play around with malicious code  said mr hogan  2004 saw a significant rise in criminal use of malicious programs. the financial incentives were driving criminal use of technology  he said. his comment was echoed by graham cluley  senior technology consultant from anti-virus firm sophos. mr cluley said:  when the commercial world gets involved  things really get nasty. virus writers and hackers will be looking to make a tidy sum.   in particular  phishing attacks  which typically use fake versions of bank websites to grab login details of customers  boomed during 2004. web portal lycos europe reported a 500% increase in the number of phishing e-mail messages it was catching. the anti-phishing working group reported that the number of phishing attacks against new targets was growing at a rate of 30% or more per month. those who fall victim to these attacks can find that their bank account has been cleaned out or that their good name has been ruined by someone stealing their identity. this change in the ranks of virus writers could mean the end of the mass-mailing virus which attempts to spread by tricking people into opening infected attachments on e-mail messages.  they are not an efficient way of spreading viruses   said mr hogan.  they are very noisy and they are not technically challenging.  the opening months of 2004 did see the appearance of the netsky  bagle and mydoom mass mailers  but since then more surreptitious viruses  or worms  have dominated.  mr hogan said worm writers were more interested in recruiting pcs to take part in  bot nets  that can be used to send out spam or to mount attacks on websites.  in september symantec released statistics which showed that the numbers of active  bot computers  rose from 2 000 to 30 000 per day. thanks to these  bot nets   spam continued to be a problem in 2004. anti-spam firms report that  in many cases  legitimate e-mail has shrunk to less than 30% of messages. part of the reason that these  bot nets  have become so prevalent  he said  was due to a big change in the way that many viruses were created. in the past many viruses  such as netsky  have been the work of an individual or group. by contrast  said mr hogan  the code for viruses such as gaobot  spybot and randex were commonly held and many groups work on them to produce new variants at the same time. the result is that now there are more than 3 000 variations of the spybot worm.  that s unprecedented   said mr hogan.  what makes it difficult is that they are all co-existing with each other and do not exist in an easy to understand chronology.   the emergence of the first proper virus for mobile phones was also seen in 2004.  in the past  threats to smart phones have been largely theoretical because the viruses created to cripple phones existed only in the laboratory rather than the wild. in june  the cabir virus was discovered that can hop from phone to phone using bluetooth short-range radio technology. also released this year was the mosquito game for symbian phones which surreptitiously sends messages to premium rate numbers  and in november the skulls trojan came to light which can cripple phones. on the positive side  finnish security firm f-secure said that 2004 was the best-ever year for the capture  arrest and sentencing of virus writers and criminally-minded hackers. in total  eight virus writers were arrested and some members of the so-called 29a virus writing group were sentenced. one high-profile arrest was that of german teenager sven jaschen who confessed to be behind the netsky and sasser virus families. also shut down were the carderplanet and shadowcrew websites that were used to trade stolen credit card numbers.,cyber crime boom last month see dramat growth almost everi secur threat plagu window pc count know virus broke barrier number new virus grow similarli phish attempt conmen tri

845,903,mobiles  not media players yet  mobiles are not yet ready to be all-singing  all-dancing multimedia devices which will replace portable media players  say two reports.  despite moves to bring music download services to mobiles  people do not want to trade multimedia services with size and battery life  said jupiter. a separate study by gartner has also said real-time tv broadcasts to mobiles is  unlikely  in europe until 2007. technical issues and standards must be resolved first  said the report. batteries already have to cope with other services that operators offer  like video playback  video messaging  megapixel cameras and games amongst others. bringing music download services based on the success of computer-based download services will put more demands on battery life.  fifty percent of europeans said the size of a mobile was the most important factor when it came to choosing their phone  but more power demands tend to mean larger handsets.  mobile phone music services must not be positioned to compete with the pc music experience as the handsets are not yet ready   said thomas husson  mobile analyst at jupiter research.  mobile music services should be new and different  and enable operators to differentiate their brands and support third generation network launches.  other problems facing mobile music include limited storage on phones  compared to portable players which can hold up to 40gb of music. the mobile industry is keen to get into music downloading  after the success of apple s itunes  napster and other net music download services.  with phones getting smarter and more powerful  there are also demands to be able to watch tv on the move. in the us  services like tivo to go let people transfer pre-recorded tv content onto their phones. but  the gartner report on mobile tv broadcasting in europe suggests direct broadcasting will have to wait. currently  tv-like services  where clips are downloaded  are offered by several european operators  like italy s tim and 3. mobile tv will have to overcome several barriers before it is widely taken up though  said the report.  various standards and ways of getting tv signals to mobiles are being worked on globally. in europe  trials in berlin and helsinki are making use of terrestrial tv masts to broadcast compressed signals to handsets with extra receivers. a service from the norwegian broadcasting corporation lets people watch tv programmes on their mobiles 24 hours a day. the service uses 3gp technology  one of the standards for mobile tv. but at the end of 2004  the european telecommunications institute (etsi) formally adopted digital video broadcasting handheld (dvb-h) as the mobile tv broadcasting standard for europe. operators will be working on the standard as a way to bring real-time broadcasts to mobiles  as well as trying to overcome several other barriers. the cost and infrastructure needs to set up the services will need to be addressed. handsets also need to be able to work with the dvb-h standard. tv services will have to live up to the expectations of the digital tv generation too  which expects good quality images at low prices  according to analysts. people are also likely to be put off watching tv on such small screens  said gartner. digital video recorders  like europe s sky+ box  and video-on-demand services mean people have much more control over what tv they watch. as a result  people may see broadcasting straight to mobiles as taking away that control. more powerful smartphones like the xda ii  nokia 6600  sonyericsson p900 and the orange e200  offering web access  text and multimedia messaging  e-mail  calendar and gaming are becoming increasingly common. a report by analysts instat/mdr has predicted that smartphone shipments will grow by 44% over the next five years. it says that smartphones will make up 117 million out of 833 million handsets shipped globally by 2009.,mobil medium player yet mobil yet readi

847,344,blair returns from peace mission prime minister tony blair has arrived back from his diplomatic mission to the middle east to try to resurrect the peace process.  mr blair held talks with his israeli counterpart  ariel sharon  and the palestinian leader  mahmoud abbas. he confirmed that a renewed drive to reform the palestinian authority and address security issues would come at a london conference in march. mr blair also made a surprise trip to iraq this week. the israelis described the meeting as important but said they would not need to attend. mr blair briefly visited the tomb of yasser arafat in ramallah - the first world leader to do so. he nodded briefly towards the tomb  rather than lay a wreath  in what palestinian officials said was a compromise gesture agreed at the last minute.  the bbc s paul reynolds says the london conference will be a limited measure to shore up the leadership of mahmoud abbas  also known as abu mazen  who is expected to win the palestinian presidential election on 9 january. at a news conference following talks with mr blair  mr abbas said the british prime minister was  in a unique position to help us progress in our peaceful pursuit . he added:  your endeavour to hold a conference in london is another example of your deep commitment to this purpose.  in an interview with the bbc s political editor andrew marr  mr blair said getting progress between israelis and palestinians would be  tough  but at least we have got the first step . mr blair acknowledged some people believed he was too close to the israelis  but said the israelis were entitled to expect palestinians to give up terrorism. he argued that mr sharon was committed to the internationally-agreed roadmap peace plan and said his bid to disengage from gaza had to be part of the peace process  not the end of it. earlier  mr sharon again said he had not seen  the slightest step  the palestinians were working to end terror attacks - though he acknowledged palestinian leaders were in the middle of an election campaign that could be hampering their efforts. before visiting israel  mr blair made a surprise visit to iraq  where he met leaders in baghdad during his first trip to the city. he was briefed on preparations for the national poll  which is scheduled for next month but is threatened by a deadly campaign of insurgent violence. he also flew to basra in southern iraq where british forces are stationed.,blair return peac mission prime minist toni blair arriv back diplomat mission middl east tri resurrect peac process mr blair held talk isra counterpart ariel sharon palestinian leader mahmoud abba confirm renew drive reform palestinian author address secur issu would come london confer march mr blair also make surpris trip iraq week isra describ meet import say would need attend mr blair briefli visit tomb yasser arafat ramallah first world leader nod briefli toward tomb rather lay wreath palestinian offici say compromis gestur agre last minut bbc paul reynold say london confer limit measur shore leadership mahmoud abba also know abu mazen expect win palestinian presidenti elect januari news confer follow talk mr blair mr abba say british prime minist uniqu posit help u progress peac pursuit ad endeavour hold confer london anoth exampl deep commit purpos interview bbc polit editor andrew marr mr blair say get progress isra palestinian would tough least get first step mr blair acknowledg peopl believ close isra say isra entitl expect palestinian give terror argu mr sharon commit internationallyagre roadmap peac plan say bid disengag gaza part peac process end earlier mr sharon say see slightest step palestinian work end terror attack though acknowledg palestinian leader middl elect campaign could hamper effort visit israel mr blair make surpris visit iraq met leader baghdad first trip citi brief prepar nation poll schedul next month threaten deadli campaign insurg violenc also flew basra southern iraq british forc station
848,613,profile: gordon brown the ultimate prize of 10 downing street may continue to elude him but  as he prepares to deliver a record-breaking ninth budget  gordon brown can at least console himself with the thought that he is the longest serving chancellor of modern times.  he reached that milestone last june  when he overtook david lloyd george  who served for seven years and 43 days between 1908 and 1915. how much longer mr brown will continue in the job is not clear (he once said there are two types of chancellor:  those who fail and those who get out in time. ) there are rumours he will be moved to the foreign office if labour wins the general election. but  for now  mr brown dominates the domestic political scene like few chancellors - or politicians - before him.  gordon brown was born in glasgow on 20 february 1951  the son of a church of scotland minister in the small fife town of kirkcaldy. at 12  he was canvassing for labour and by his 20s he was a leading political activist in scotland. he achieved a first class degree in history from edinburgh university  where he went on to complete a phd. his early career was spent lecturing  working in television and making a name for himself in the scottish labour party.  his first attempt to enter westminster  for edinburgh south in 1979  was thwarted by the present tory spokesman on foreign affairs  michael ancram. but in 1983  he took dunfermline east  a new constituency including rosyth naval base  pit villages and coastal towns.  entering westminster  he came to share an office with the newly elected mp for sedgefield  tony blair. within four years  mr brown had gained his first frontbench post as shadow chief secretary to the treasury. he became shadow chancellor under john smith s leadership in 1992. after the death of leader john smith in 1994 he stood aside  agreeing to give tony blair a clear run at the leadership during a now infamous meal at the granita restaurant in islington.  the other part of the deal  that mr blair will one day stand down in favour of the chancellor  is the stuff of westminster legend. mr blair s supporters say such a deal never existed and endless newspaper columns - and even a television film - have been devoted to the alleged deal. but if his leadership ambitions were at least temporarily thwarted in 1994  mr brown continued his devotion to politics. during the 1997 election campaign  he is said to have worked an average of 18 hours a day  six days a week after running on a treadmill for an hour each morning.  this dedication to his career was underlined by a comment by mr brown s former girlfriend of five years  princess marguerite of romania  the eldest daughter of ex-king michael of romania  who said a relationship with him was  politics  politics  politics .  if that was true then  mr brown  who married pr executive sarah macaulay in 2000  changed his perspective when the couple were hit by tragedy early in 2002. their daughter jennifer died in edinburgh royal infirmary  10 days after being born seven weeks prematurely. a year later  in october 2003  the couple had a son - john - an event which again gave the chancellor an opportunity to show his softer side. a trip to africa earlier this year  to publicise his scheme to cancel the debt of poor nations  also gave the chancellor an opportunity to show his more human side.  the ideological differences between mr brown and mr blair remain relatively modest. the chancellor opposes the further encroachment of the market into the nhs and is seen as being more  old labour  than mr blair in his approach to wealth redistribution. but their shared belief that market economics are compatible with social justice continues to form the ideological heart of the new labour project. yet they are portrayed by the media as being locked in almost permanent conflict  with mr brown supposedly nursing resentment at being betrayed by his younger downing street neighbour over the succession. mr blair  for his part  is said to be frustrated that his public service reforms are being thwarted by a vengeful mr brown  who reportedly delights in keeping the prime minister in the dark over the contents of his budget until the last possible minute. after a recent run of negative headlines  labour mps took the unprecedented step of making a direct appeal to the two men stop bickering  for the good of the party. events like this  and the testimony of former ministerial colleagues  make it impossible to dismiss the brown/blair feud as just journalistic hearsay  cooked up by hacks and camp followers in the hothouse atmosphere of westminster. how much it damages the ability of government to do its job is open to question.  a truce appears to have been called in the run up to the general election after a fresh spat was sparked by blairite alan milburn being brought in over the head of mr brown to run the election campaign. but with the tories having appeared to get the better of the pre-election campaign thus far there are reports that mr brown - using the budget as a springboard - is to revitalise labour s campaign. amid all this it is easy to forget that mr brown remains the man most likely to succeed mr blair as labour leader. there may be no shortage of possible contenders for the crown - including mr milburn - but none can command the sort of support in the parliamentary party and beyond that mr brown can. and mr blair s decision to name his own retirement date has at least given mr brown something to aim for - even if the prime minister s intention to  serve a full third term  if elected  took the shine off the announcement for the chancellor and his supporters.,profil gordon brown ultim prize down street may continu elud prepar deliv recordbreak ninth budget gordon brown least consol thought long serv chancellor modern time reach mileston last june overtook david lloyd georg serv seven year day much longer mr brown continu job clear say two type chancellor fail get time rumour move foreign offic labour win gener elect mr brown domin domest polit scene like chancellor politician gordon brown born glasgow februari son church scotland minist small fife town kirkcaldi canvas labour s lead polit activist scotland achiev first class degre histori edinburgh univers go complet phd earli career spent lectur work televis make name scottish labour parti first attempt enter westminst edinburgh south thwart present torus spokesman foreign affair michael ancram take dunfermlin east new constitu includ rosyth naval base pit villag coastal town enter westminst come share offic newli elect mp sedgefield toni blair within four year mr brown gain first frontbench post shadow chief secretari treasuri becam shadow chancellor john smith leadership death leader john smith stood asid agre give toni blair clear run leadership infam meal granita restaur islington part deal mr blair one day stand favour chancellor stuff westminst legend mr blair support say deal never exist endless newspap column even televis film devot alleg deal leadership ambit least temporarili thwart mr brown continu devot polit elect campaign say work averag hour day six day week run treadmil hour morn dedic career underlin comment mr brown former girlfriend five year princess marguerit romania eldest daughter exk michael romania say relationship polit polit polit true mr brown marri pr execut sarah macaulay chang perspect coupl hit tragedi earli daughter jennif die edinburgh royal infirmari day born seven week prematur year later octob coupl son john event give chancellor opportun show softer side trip africa earlier year publicis scheme cancel debt poor nation also give chancellor opportun show human side ideolog differ mr brown mr blair remain rel modest chancellor oppos encroach market nh see old labour mr blair approach wealth redistribut share belief market econom compat social justic continu form ideolog heart new labour project yet portray medium lock almost perman conflict mr brown supposedli nurs resent betray young down street neighbour success mr blair part say frustrat public servic reform thwart veng mr brown reportedli delight keep prime minist dark content budget last possibl minut recent run neg headlin labour mp take unpreced step make direct appeal two men stop bicker good parti event like testimoni former ministeri colleagu make imposs dismiss brownblair feud journalist hearsay cook hack camp follow hothous atmospher westminst much damag abil govern job open question truce appear call run gener elect fresh spat spark blairit alan milburn brought head mr brown run elect campaign torus appear get well preelect campaign thu far report mr brown use budget springboard revitalis labour campaign amid easi forget mr brown remain man like succeed mr blair labour leader may shortag possibl contend crown includ mr milburn none command sort support parliamentari parti beyond mr brown mr blair decis name retir date least give mr brown someth aim even prime minist intent serv full third term elect take shine announc chancellor support
849,1397,bellamy fined after row newcastle have fined their welsh striker craig bellamy two weeks  wages - about £80 000 - following his row with manager graeme souness.  but bellamy  25  has not been put on the transfer list  although he did not train with the first team on tuesday. magpies chairman freddy shepherd told the newcastle evening chronicle:  it is not about money. it is about a player thinking he is bigger than this club.  no individual is  be it the chairman  the manager or a player.  souness dropped bellamy for sunday s game against arsenal  claiming the welshman had feigned injury after being asked to play out of position.  when i heard what the manager was saying i was in shock   bellamy said.  i thought  not only has he gone behind my back  he s lying    he said in response to souness  remarks. and the wales international refused to apologise.  i won t apologise because i have done nothing wrong   he told the evening chronicle.  there s no doubt about it  i am out of here.  the difficult relationship between souness and bellamy boiled over at the weekend  and has led to a war of words in the media.  bellamy s claim that souness had lied about the background to the bust-up was strongly denied by shepherd  who accused the striker of  cheating  the club.  i wish to put the record straight regarding the bellamy situation   said shepherd.  craig walked off the training ground saying his hamstring was tight (on friday)  but what he failed to reveal was that he had told other members of the squad before training that he intended to feign injury.  when graeme discovered this he immediately ordered bellamy to attend a meeting in my office.  at that meeting bellamy admitted to graeme and i that he had told the players that he was going to  fake  an injury in training and walk off.  he also agreed at that meeting to apologise to his team-mates for his behaviour. he didn t do this which resulted in the action taken by the manager at the weekend  which i fully support.  in my book this is cheating on the club  the supporters  the manager and his own team-mates.  he is paid extremely well and i consider his behaviour to be totally unacceptable and totally unprofessional.   bellamy s latest outburst would appear to make his chances of a first-team recall remote. but even before newcastle said the player would not be sold  bellamy insisted he had no intention of handing in a transfer request.  i don t want the fans to think for one minute that i wouldn t play for this club   he said.  i d play anywhere for this club  even in goal.  it s a very difficult situation for me at the moment but i d never ask to leave this club.  this club means so much to me. i couldn t do it because i know i couldn t come back here and play against newcastle. it would hurt too much.,bellami fine row newcastl fine welsh striker craig bellami two week wage £ follow row manag graem souness bellami put transfer list although train first team tuesday magpi chairman freddi shepherd told newcastl even chronicl money player think big club individu chairman manag player souness drop bellami sunday game arsen claim welshman feign injuri ask play posit heard manag say shock bellami say thought go behind back lie say respons souness remark wale intern refus apologis apologis do noth wrong told even chronicl doubt difficult relationship souness bellami boil weekend lead war word medium bellami claim souness lie background bustup strongli deni shepherd accus striker cheat club wish put record straight regard bellami situat say shepherd craig walk train ground say hamstr tight friday fail reveal told member squad train intend feign injuri graem discov immedi order bellami attend meet offic meet bellami admit graem told player go fake injuri train walk also agre meet apologis teammat behaviour result action take manag weekend fulli support book cheat club support manag teammat paid extrem well consid behaviour total unaccept total unprofession bellami late outburst would appear make chanc firstteam recal remot even newcastl say player would sell bellami insist intent hand transfer request want fan think one minut play club say play anywher club even goal difficult situat moment never ask leav club club mean much know come back play newcastl would hurt much

853,1792,choose hope over fear - kennedy voters will have a clear choice between the politics of fear and the politics of hope in the next general election  said charles kennedy.  in his new year message the liberal democrat leader said labour and the conservatives were united in relying on fear and  populist scares . he said his party was the one of hope and was ready for a 2005 poll. on the asian tsunami he said it had been  very heartening  to learn of the generosity being shown by britons. mr kennedy said his thoughts were with all those caught up in the disaster  which had dominated the christmas and new year period. at home he said many people were turning to the liberal democrats as they became disheartened with the politics of the other two main parties.  the general election would be a three-party struggle  as the conservative party  fades away  as a national force and the liberal democrats challenge labour in its heartlands  he said.  a clear division is emerging in british politics - the politics of fear versus the politics of hope.  labour is counting on the politics of fear  ratcheting up talk of threats  crime and insecurity. while the conservatives are re-working their populist scares about asylum and the european  menace    he said. he said the government was using this climate of fear to try to strip away civil liberties.  it was already using detention without trial at belmarsh prison  ignoring a recent law lords judgement that this contravenes basic human rights  he said. he also criticised attempts to bring in trial without jury  plans to lower the burden of proof in some criminal trials  curbing of rights to protest  increased stop and search powers and id card plans. he said while everyone had the right to be secure they also had the right to be protected against unfair discrimination.  but at the same time  an overmighty state is a dangerous one   he said. his party  instinctively  understood the  new liberal britain  which is no longer a nation with one family structure  and one colour  he said.  we are less deferential; more inclined to think for ourselves; more open about sexuality and equality.  our national institutions are changing too. we are no longer a nation of one church; we are a nation of many faiths. in our attitudes and the way we live our lives  this is in many ways a liberal britain.,choos hope fear kennedi voter clear choic polit fear polit hope next gener elect say charl kennedi new year messag liber democrat leader say labour conserv unit reli fear populist scare say parti one hope readi poll asian tsunami say hearten learn generos show briton mr kennedi say thought caught disast domin christma new year period home say mani peopl turn liber democrat becam dishearten polit two main parti gener elect would threeparti struggl conserv parti fade away nation forc liber democrat challeng labour heartland say clear divis emerg british polit polit fear versu polit hope labour count polit fear ratchet talk threat crime insecur conserv rework populist scare asylum european menac say say govern use climat fear tri strip away civil liberti alreadi use detent without trial belmarsh prison ignor recent law lord judgement contraven basic human right say also criticis attempt bring trial without juri plan low burden proof crimin trial curb right protest increas stop search power id card plan say everyon right secur also right protect unfair discrimin time overmighti state danger one say parti instinct understood new liber britain longer nation one famili structur one colour say less deferenti inclin think open sexual equal nation institut chang longer nation one church nation mani faith attitud way live live mani way liber britain
854,1469,election  could be terror target  terrorists might try to target the uk in the run-up to the election  london s most senior police officer has said.  sir ian blair said terror groups would remember the effect of the madrid bomb on spain s general election last year. other potential targets were the royal wedding and the uk s presidency of the european union and g8  he said. he refused to say if there was specific information about the risk of a pre-poll attack. no 10 was similarly cautious but said the threat was real.  the comments come after tony blair defended his controversial anti-terror proposals  warning that it would be wrong to wait for an attack before acting. sir ian told a meeting of the metropolitan police authority it would be  unwise  to speculate about whether there was specific information about risks of a pre-election attack. but he said:  terrorists have long memories. they understand what happened in madrid and know what the impact of that was on the spanish electorate.   this year we are responsible for the eu presidency  presidency of the g8  a royal wedding and a general election.  there are obvious and enormous targets which we have to deal with.  sir ian said the debate over anti-terror plans was one for politicians  not the police  who would enforce any new powers.  home secretary charles clarke has also warned that a madrid-style pre-election bombing could happen in the uk too. asked about sir ian s comments  the prime minister s official spokesman said:  we believe the threat is real.  the spokesman declined to comment on whether the security services had received specific intelligence relating to a possible attack during the election campaign. he said no 10 did not disclose any security advice they received. earlier  writing in the daily telegraph  the prime minister conceded that plans to detain suspects under house arrest without trial were  difficult issues for any government . the commons has approved the measures despite considerable opposition  with the government s majority more than halved as 32 labour rebels joined tory and lib dem opposition. but mr blair insisted:  there is no greater civil liberty than to live free from terrorist attack.   tory leader michael howard has accused mr blair of steamrolling the house arrest plans and of  using national security for political point scoring . liberal democrat leader charles kennedy says that the plan is a further example of labour s  authoritarian  response to crises. the prevention of terrorism bill proposes  control orders   which as well as house arrest could impose curfews  tagging or bans on telephone and internet use. they would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial  which the law lords have ruled against. but critics are concerned that it would be the home secretary and not judges who decided to impose control orders. the plans face further commons scrutiny on monday before passing to the lords.,elect could terror target terrorist might tri target uk runup elect london senior polic offic say sir ian blair say terror group would rememb effect madrid bomb spain gener elect last year potenti target royal wed uk presid european union g say refus say specif inform risk prepol attack similarli cautiou say threat real comment come toni blair defend controversi antiterror propos warn would wrong wait attack act sir ian told meet metropolitan polic author would unwis specul whether specif inform risk preelect attack say terrorist long memori understand happen madrid know impact spanish elector year respons eu presid presid g royal wed gener elect obviou enorm target deal sir ian say debat antiterror plan one politician polic would enforc new power home secretari charl clark also warn madridstyl preelect bomb could happen uk ask sir ian comment prime minist offici spokesman say believ threat real spokesman declin comment whether secur servic receiv specif intellig relat possibl attack elect campaign say disclos secur advic receiv earlier write daili telegraph prime minist conced plan detain suspect hous arrest without trial difficult issu govern common approv measur despit consider opposit govern major halv labour rebel join torus lib dem opposit mr blair insist great civil liberti live free terrorist attack torus leader michael howard accus mr blair steamrol hous arrest plan use nation secur polit point score liber democrat leader charl kennedi say plan exampl labour authoritarian respons crise prevent terror bill propos control order well hous arrest could impos curfew tag ban telephon internet use would replac current power detain foreign terror suspect without trial law lord rule critic concern would home secretari judg decid impos control order plan face common scrutini monday pas lord
855,189,mcconnell in  drunk  remark row scotland s first minister has told a group of high school pupils that it is okay to get drunk  once in a while .  jack mcconnell was speaking to more than 100 secondary pupils from schools in the highlands about the problems of binge drinking and drink promotions. he has been criticised by the snp for encouraging young people to get drunk. but the scottish executive has insisted mr mcconnell was speaking about adults and his comments were  a recognition that people will get drunk . the first minister s comments came in a question and answer session at glenurquhart high school in inverness  attended by pupils from a number of secondary schools. a highland councillor who was at the event has also defended mr mcconnell. margaret davidson  the independent member for the loch ness west  said the first minister was speaking in a very general way and she was sure he was speaking about adults at the time.  when one pupil asked mr mcconnell how the executive proposed to tackle under-age drinking  began his response with the quip:  i m sure there s no under-age drinking in the highlands.  he went on to speak about the evils of binge drinking and railed against irresponsible drinks promotions. he said:  i hope i m not going to be seen as preaching to anybody here but the really serious problem at the moment is binge drinking and the impact it has on people s health and their ability to control what s happening round about them.  mr mcconnell said he regularly saw reports on the effects of binge drinking sprees which ended in assaults or even rapes  and on the health consequences of binge drinking.  the one thing we are going to do something really serious about is binge drinking and irresponsible drinks promotions that can help lead to that   he said.  far too many pub chains in particular are selling far too much booze far too cheaply and encouraging people to drink it far too quickly.  we are go to clamp down on that and make those promotions illegal in the hope that people can enjoy a drink sensibly over the course of an evening.   he added:  by all means get drunk once in a while - but do not get into a situation where people are being encouraged to get completely incapable just to save some money and drink more quickly.  snp holyrood leader nicola sturgeon said:  this is an incredible gaffe by jack mcconnell.  we all know that under-age drinking is an issue in scotland but it is quite staggering that any politician  particularly the first minister  should encourage young people to get drunk.  the first minister should withdraw these remarks immediately.  but an executive spokeswoman insisted mr mcconnell had made the remark with adults  not youngsters  in mind.  he was talking in the context of adults binge drinking and irresponsible drinks promotions - which are for the over-18s   she said.  it was just a recognition that people will get drunk  but that binge drinking and drinks promotions that encourage it are not acceptable.,mcconnel drunk remark row scotland first minist told group high school pupil okay get drunk jack mcconnel speak secondari pupil school highland problem bing drink drink promot criticis snp encourag young peopl get drunk scottish execut insist mr mcconnel speak adult comment recognit peopl get drunk first minist comment come question answer session glenurquhart high school inver attend pupil number secondari school highland councillor event also defend mr mcconnel margaret davidson independ member loch ness west say first minist speak gener way sure speak adult time one pupil ask mr mcconnel execut propos tackl underag drink begin respons quip sure underag drink highland go speak evil bing drink rail irrespons drink promot say hope go see preach anybodi realli seriou problem moment bing drink impact peopl health abil control happen round mr mcconnel say regularli saw report effect bing drink spree end assault even rape health consequ bing drink one thing go someth realli seriou bing drink irrespons drink promot help lead say far mani pub chain particular sell far much booz far cheapli encourag peopl drink far quickli go clamp make promot illeg hope peopl enjoy drink sensibl cours even ad mean get drunk get situat peopl encourag get complet incap save money drink quickli snp holyrood leader nicola sturgeon say incred gaff jack mcconnel know underag drink issu scotland quit stagger politician particularli first minist encourag young peopl get drunk first minist withdraw remark immedi execut spokeswoman insist mr mcconnel make remark adult youngster mind talk context adult bing drink irrespons drink promot over say recognit peopl get drunk bing drink drink promot encourag accept
856,2042,virus poses as christmas e-mail security firms are warning about a windows virus disguising itself as an electronic christmas card.  the zafi.d virus translates the christmas greeting on its subject line into the language of the person receiving infected e-mail. anti-virus firms speculate that this multilingual ability is helping the malicious program spread widely online. anti-virus firm sophos said that 10% of the e-mail currently on the net was infected with the zafi virus.  like many other windows viruses  zafi-d plunders microsoft outlook for e-mail addresses and then uses mail-sending software to despatch itself across the web to new victims. to be infected users must open up the attachment travelling with the message which bears the code for the malicious bug. the attachment on the e-mail poses as an electronic christmas card but anyone opening it will simply get a crude image of two smiley faces.  the virus  subject line says  merry christmas  and translates this into one of 15 languages depending of the final suffix of the e-mail address the infected message has been sent to. the message in the body of the e-mail reads:  happy holidays  and this too is translated. on infected machines the virus tries to disable anti-virus and firewall software and opens up a backdoor on the pc to hand over control to the writer of the virus. the virus is thought to have spread most widely in south america  italy  spain  bulgaria and hungary. the original zafi virus appeared in april this year.  we have seen these hoaxes for several christmases already  and personally i prefer traditional pen and paper cards  and we recommend this to all our clients too   said mikko hypponen  who heads f-secure s anti-virus team.,viru pose christma email secur firm warn window viru disguis electron christma card zafid viru translat christma greet subject line languag person receiv infect email antiviru firm specul multilingu abil help malici program spread wide onlin antiviru firm sopho say email current net infect zafi viru like mani window virus zafid plunder microsoft outlook email address use mailsend softwar despatch across web new victim infect user must open attach travel messag bear code malici bug attach email pose electron christma card anyon open simpli get crude imag two smiley face viru subject line say merri christma translat one languag depend final suffix email address infect messag sent messag bodi email read happi holiday translat infect machin viru tri disabl antiviru firewal softwar open backdoor pc hand control writer viru viru thought spread wide south america itali spain bulgaria hungari origin zafi viru appear april year see hoax sever christmas alreadi person prefer tradit pen paper card recommend client say mikko hypponen head fsecur antiviru team

859,136,europe backs digital tv lifestyle how people receive their digital entertainment in the future could change  following the launch of an ambitious european project.  in nice last week  the european commission announced its networked & electronic media (nem) initiative. its broad scope stretches from the way media is created  through each of the stages of its distribution  to its playback. the commission wants people to be able to locate the content they desire and have it delivered seamlessly  when on the move  at home or at work  no matter who supplies the devices  network  content  or content protection scheme. more than 120 experts were in nice to share the vision of interconnected future and hear pledges of support from companies such as nokia  intel  philips  alcatel  france telecom  thomson and telefonica. it might initially appear to be surprising that companies in direct competition are keen to work together. but again and again  speakers stated they could not see incompatible  stand-alone solutions working. a long-term strategy for the evolution and convergence of technologies and services would be required.  the european commission is being pragmatic in its approach. they have identified that many groups have defined the forms of digital media in the areas that nem encompasses. the nem approach is to take a serious look at what is available and what is in the pipeline  pick out the best  bring them together and identify where the gaps are. where it finds holes  it will develop standards to fill them. what is significant is that such a large and powerful organisation has stated its desire for digital formats to be open to all and work on any gadget. this is bound to please  if not surprise  many individuals and user organisations who feel that the wishes of the holder of rights to content are normally considered over and above those of the consumer. many feel that the most difficult and challenging area for the commission will be to identify a solution for different digital rights management (drm) schemes. currently drm solutions are incompatible  locking certain types of purchased content  making them unplayable on all platforms. with the potential of having a percentage of every media transaction that takes place globally  the prize for being the supplier of the world s dominant drm scheme is huge. although entertainment is an obvious first step  it will encompass the remote provisions of healthcare  energy efficiency and control of the smart home. the 10-year plan brings together the work of many currently running research projects that the ec has been funding for a number of years.  simon perry is the editor of the digital lifestyles website  which covers the impact of technology on media,europ back digit tv lifestyl peopl receiv digit entertain futur could chang follow launch ambiti european project nice last week european commiss announc network electron medium nem initi broad scope stretch way medium creat stage distribut playback commiss want peopl abl locat content desir deliv seamlessli move home work matter suppli devic network content content protect scheme expert nice share vision interconnect futur hear pledg support compani nokia intel philip alcatel franc telecom thomson telefonica might initi appear surpris compani direct competit keen work togeth speaker state could see incompat standalon solut work longterm strategi evolut converg technolog servic would requir european commiss pragmat approach identifi mani group defin form digit medium area nem encompass nem approach take seriou look avail pipelin pick best bring togeth identifi gap find hole develop standard fill signific larg power organis state desir digit format open work gadget bound plea surpris mani individu user organis feel wish holder right content normal consid consum mani feel difficult challeng area commiss identifi solut differ digit right manag drm scheme current drm solut incompat lock certain type purchas content make unplay platform potenti percentag everi medium transact take place global prize supplier world domin drm scheme huge although entertain obviou first step encompass remot provis healthcar energi effici control smart home year plan bring togeth work mani current run research project ec fund number year simon perri editor digit lifestyl websit cover impact technolog medium
860,224,no-one can define new hunt ban  the new law banning hunting with dogs is  so poorly drafted  no-one can define the offence  pro-hunt mps say.  the accusation came after it emerged a devon man had been told he could use his four dogs to  chase away unwanted animals  from his farm. because he did not intend to kill deer or foxes it was not hunting. lib dem mp lembit opik said ministers had invented a new category of hunting - chasing away - and asked how police were supposed to interpret the rules.  north devon landowner giles bradshaw was put in touch with the middle way group  of which mr opik is a co-chairman  after he had been in contact with the rural affairs ministry  defra. he had asked whether his technique of using his four dogs to frighten off deer and foxes would be outlawed under the hunting act. mr bradshaw was initially told it was an offence - prompting him to complain. the middle way group also said mr bradshaw would be put in a position where he would have to buy a rifle to shoot animals that would have previously gone free. in a later conversation mr bradshaw was told that according to defra s lawyers chasing away unwanted animals was  not in fact hunting as described in the hunting act 2004 therefore you would not be committing an offence .  mr opik said:  hunting with dogs and flushing are not defined in the hunting act.  now defra have also invented a completely new category of hunting -  chasing away  which isn t even covered by the act.  however  all these activities involve the use of dogs to chase wild mammals.  how is the village bobby who sees a group of people with dogs supposed to distinguish between illegal hunting  exempt hunting  drag hunting  unintentional hunting  a hunt exercising hounds or simply chasing away   tory mp peter luff  another co-chairman of middle way  said that the legislation was  so poorly drafted nobody appears able to properly define the offence .   it is no wonder the government desperately wants to move on from this disastrous law. however  i seriously doubt the countryside will be that accommodating.  mike hobday  of the league against cruel sports  said:  there is no confusion  it is a matter of simple common sense.  if mr bradshaw is setting his dogs to chase wild animals then he is hunting them and that will be a criminal offence.  if all the dogs are doing is barking at the deer  then nobody can define that as hunting.,noon defin new hunt ban new law ban hunt dog poorli draft noon defin offenc prohunt mp say accus come emerg devon man told could use four dog chase away unwant anim farm intend kill deer fox hunt lib dem mp lembit opik say minist invent new categori hunt chase away ask polic suppos interpret rule north devon landown gile bradshaw put touch middl way group mr opik cochairman contact rural affair ministri defra ask whether techniqu use four dog frighten deer fox would outlaw hunt act mr bradshaw initi told offenc prompt complain middl way group also say mr bradshaw would put posit would buy rifl shoot anim would previous go free later convers mr bradshaw told accord defra lawyer chase away unwant anim fact hunt describ hunt act therefor would commit offenc mr opik say hunt dog flush defin hunt act defra also invent complet new categori hunt chase away even cover act howev activ involv use dog chase wild mammal villag bobbi see group peopl dog suppos distinguish illeg hunt exempt hunt drag hunt unintent hunt hunt exercis hound simpli chase away torus mp peter luff anoth cochairman middl way say legisl poorli draft nobodi appear abl properli defin offenc wonder govern desper want move disastr law howev serious doubt countrysid accommod mike hobday leagu cruel sport say confus matter simpl common sen mr bradshaw set dog chase wild anim hunt crimin offenc dog bark deer nobodi defin hunt

862,187,deutsche boerse set to  woo  lse bosses of deutsche boerse and the london stock exchange are to meet amid talk that a takeover bid for the lse will be raised to £1.5bn ($2.9bn).  last month  the german exchange tabled a 530 pence-per-share offer for lse  valuing it at £1.3bn. paris-based euronext  owner of liffe in london  has also said it is interested in bidding for lse. euronext is due to hold talks with lse this week and it is reported to be ready to raise £1.4bn to fund a bid. euronext chief jean-francois theodore is scheduled to meet his lse counterpart clara furse on friday. deutsche boerse chief werner seifert is meeting ms furse on thursday  in the third meeting between the two exchanges since the bid approach in december.  the lse rejected deutsche boerse s proposed £1.3bn offer in december  saying it undervalued the business.  but it agreed to leave the door open for talks to find out whether a  significantly-improved proposal  would be in the interests of lse s shareholders and customers. in the meantime  euronext  which combines the paris  amsterdam and lisbon stock exchanges  also began talks with the lse. in a statement on thursday  euronext said any offer was likely to be solely in cash  but added that:  there can be no assurances at this stage that any offer will be made.  a deal with either bidder would create the biggest stock market operator in europe and the second biggest in the world after the new york stock exchange.  according to the ft  in its latest meeting deutsche boerse will adopt a charm offensive to woo the london exchange. the newspaper said the german suitor will offer to manage a combined cash and equities market out of london and let ms furse take the helm. other reports this week said the deutsche boerse might even consider selling its luxembourg-based clearstream unit - the clearing house that processes securities transactions. its ownership of clearstream was seen as the main stumbling block to a london-frankfurt merger. lse shareholders feared a deutsche boerse takeover would force them to use clearstream  making it difficult for them to negotiate for lower transaction fees.,deutsch boer set woo lse bos deutsch boer london stock exchang meet amid talk takeov bid lse rais £bn bn last month german exchang tabl pencepershar offer lse valu £bn parisbas euronext owner liff london also say interest bid lse euronext due hold talk lse week report readi rais £bn fund bid euronext chief jeanfrancoi theodor schedul meet lse counterpart clara fur friday deutsch boer chief werner seifert meet m fur thursday third meet two exchang sinc bid approach decemb lse reject deutsch boer propos £bn offer decemb say undervalu busi agre leav door open talk find whether significantlyimprov propos would interest lse sharehold custom meantim euronext combin pari amsterdam lisbon stock exchang also begin talk lse statement thursday euronext say offer like sole cash ad assur stage offer make deal either bidder would creat big stock market oper europ second big world new york stock exchang accord ft late meet deutsch boer adopt charm offens woo london exchang newspap say german suitor offer manag combin cash equiti market london let m fur take helm report week say deutsch boer might even consid sell luxembourgbas clearstream unit clear hous process secur transact ownership clearstream see main stumbl block londonfrankfurt merger lse sharehold fear deutsch boer takeov would forc use clearstream make difficult negoti low transact fee
863,42,federer claims dubai crown world number one roger federer added the dubai championship trophy to his long list of successes - but not before he was given a test by ivan ljubicic.  top seed federer looked to be on course for a easy victory when he thumped the eighth seed 6-1 in the first set. but ljubicic  who beat tim henman in the last eight  dug deep to secure the second set after a tense tiebreak. swiss star federer was not about to lose his cool  though  turning on the style to win the deciding set 6-3. the match was a re-run of last week s final at the world indoor tournament in rotterdam  where federer triumphed  but not until ljubicic had stretched him for five sets.  i really wanted to get off to a good start this time  and i did  and i could really play with confidence while he still looking for his rhythm   federer said.   that took me all the way through to 6-1 3-1 0-30 on his serve and i almost ran away with it. but he came back  and that was a good effort on his side.  ljubicic was at a loss to explain his poor showing in the first set.  i didn t start badly  but then suddenly i felt like my racket was loose and the balls were flying a little bit too much. and with roger  if you relax for a second it just goes very quick   he said.  after those first three games it was no match at all. i don t know  it was really weird. i was playing really well the whole year  and then suddenly i found myself in trouble just to put the ball in the court.  but despite his defeat  the world number 14 was pleased with his overall performance.  i had a chance in the third  and for me it s really positive to twice in two weeks have a chance against roger to win the match.  it s an absolutely great boost to my confidence that i m up there and belong with top-class players.,feder claim dubai crown world number one roger feder ad dubai championship trophi long list success give test ivan ljubic top seed feder look cours easi victori thump eighth seed first set ljubic beat tim henman last eight dug deep secur second set ten tiebreak swiss star feder lose cool though turn style win decid set match rerun last week final world indoor tournament rotterdam feder triumph ljubic stretch five set realli want get good start time could realli play confid still look rhythm feder say take way serv almost ran away come back good effort side ljubic loss explain poor show first set start badli suddenli felt like racket loo ball fli littl bit much roger relax second goe quick say first three game match know realli weird play realli well whole year suddenli found troubl put ball court despit defeat world number plea overal perform chanc third realli posit twice two week chanc roger win match absolut great boost confid belong topclass player
864,1778,tevez - an argentine in brazil some 65 years ago bernardo gandulla left boca juniors in his native argentina and headed for brazil.  he arrived at the vasco da gama club with considerable prestige - which he failed to live up to. he left an impression  but not for reasons he would have wanted. the only thing of note he did was to throw the ball back when it went out of play. even today   gandula  is the term used in brazil for ballboy. brazilians delighted in the failure of gandulla then  and many will delight now if history is repeated. another boca juniors player is coming to brazil.  the new maradona  - carlos tevez - is joining corinthians for nearly $20m in a strong candidate for the strangest move of the year. corinthians - or the london-based company who have just entered into partnership with them - appear to have paid well above the odds for tevez. it is particularly strange as - until last week - tevez was not even an especially big name in brazil  where the argentine championship is not shown.  presumably there is some financial logic behind the move. what is harder to work out is why tevez should be interested in heading north  rather than across the atlantic. argentina s brightest new star hit top form in august as he spearheaded the charge towards the olympic gold medal. but the subsequent months have not been easy for tevez. boca re-signed martin palermo  forcing tevez to vacate his favoured centre forward role. and off the pitch he gave the press plenty to report - atletico madrid gave up on him after declaring his private life to be  disorganized.  hounded by the press  tevez grew tired of his life in buenos aires. so now he says that he is heading for corinthians in search of  tranquillity.  anyone acquainted with the city of s&#227;o paulo will relish the nonsense of this declaration. brazil s biggest city is a sprawling  ugly  restless metropolis. once it shared with buenos aires the same melancholy air of a city of italian immigrants.  but that world now lies buried under skyscrapers. the most turbulent place in this frenetic city is sport club corinthians. it is the most passionately supported club in brazil. pel&#233; scored reams of goals against them  reasoning that unless he did something special the corinthians fans were capable of winning the game on their own. that passion can also be turned against the team - especially nowadays  when the level of urban violence gives a hysterical edge to life in brazil s big cities. corinthians fans have invaded the dressing room or ambushed the team coach to attack the players. tevez  then  can kiss tranquillity goodbye. he can also say farewell to the copa libertadores  south america s champions league. corinthians have not qualified. indeed  he will have a long wait for a worthwhile match. next year s brazilian championship only gets underway at the end of april. until then he will have to make do with the foolish s&#227;o paulo state championship  an appalling waste of his talent. there will be matches in small towns on poor pitches with plenty of defenders keen to kick him all the way back to argentina. like so many of the top south american players  tevez has the gift of being able to surprise - to feint right and go left  to pass when he was expected to dribble  to shoot and catch the goalkeeper unawares. but his choice of destination is the biggest surprise of all.,tevez argentin brazil year ago bernardo gandulla left boca junior nativ argentina head brazil arriv vasco da gama club consider prestig fail live left impress reason would want thing note throw ball back go play even today gandula term use brazil ballboy brazilian delight failur gandulla mani delight histori repeat anoth boca junior player come brazil new maradona carlo tevez join corinthian nearli m strong candid strangest move year corinthian londonbas compani enter partnership appear paid well odd tevez particularli strang last week tevez even especi big name brazil argentin championship show presum financi logic behind move harder work tevez interest head north rather across atlant argentina brightest new star hit top form august spearhead charg toward olymp gold medal subsequ month easi tevez boca resign martin palermo forc tevez vacat favour centr forward role pitch give press plenti report atletico madrid give declar privat life disorgan hound press tevez grow tire life bueno air say head corinthian search tranquil anyon acquaint citi so paulo relish nonsens declar brazil big citi sprawl ugli restless metropoli share bueno air melancholi air citi italian immigr world lie buri skyscrap turbul place frenet citi sport club corinthian passion support club brazil pel score ream goal reason unless someth special corinthian fan capabl win game passion also turn team especi nowaday level urban violenc give hyster edg life brazil big citi corinthian fan invad dress room ambush team coach attack player tevez kiss tranquil goodby also say farewel copa libertador south america champion leagu corinthian qualifi inde long wait worthwhil match next year brazilian championship get underway end april make foolish so paulo state championship appal wast talent match small town poor pitch plenti defend keen kick way back argentina like mani top south american player tevez gift abl surpris feint right go left pas expect dribbl shoot catch goalkeep unawar choic destin big surpris

866,1511,soros group warns of kazakh close the open society institute (osi)  financed by billionaire george soros  has accused kazakhstan officials of trying to close down its local office.  a demand for unpaid taxes and fines of $600 000 (£425 000) is politically motivated  the osi claimed  adding that it paid the money in october. the organisation has found itself in trouble after being accused of helping to topple georgia s former president. it denies having any role  but offices have had to close across the region.  the osi shut its office in moscow last year and has withdrawn from uzbekistan and belarus. in the ukraine earlier this year  mr soros - who took on the bank of england in the 1990s - and won  was pelted by protestors.  this legal prosecution can be considered an attempt by the government to force soros foundation-kazakhstan to cease its activities in kazakhstan and shut its doors for kazakh citizens and organisations   the osi said.  the osi aims to promote democratic and open  market-based societies. since the break up of the soviet union in 1991  kazakhstan has been dominated by its president nursultan abish-uly nazarbayev. he has powers for life  while insulting the president and officials has been made a criminal offence. the government controls the printing presses and most radio and tv transmission facilities. it operates the country s national radio and tv networks. recent elections were criticised as flawed and the opposition claimed there was widespread vote rigging. supporters  however  say he brings much needed stability to a region where islamic militancy is on the rise. they also credit him with promoting inter-ethnic accord and pushing through harsh reforms.,soro group warn kazakh close open societi institut osi financ billionair georg soro accus kazakhstan offici tri close local offic demand unpaid tax fine £ polit motiv osi claim ad paid money octob organis found troubl accus help toppl georgia former presid deni role offic close across region osi shut offic moscow last year withdrawn uzbekistan belaru ukrain earlier year mr soro take bank england s pelt protestor legal prosecut consid attempt govern forc soro foundationkazakhstan ceas activ kazakhstan shut door kazakh citizen organis osi say osi aim promot democrat open marketbas societi sinc break soviet union kazakhstan domin presid nursultan abishuli nazarbayev power life insult presid offici make crimin offenc govern control print press radio tv transmiss facil oper countri nation radio tv network recent elect criticis flaw opposit claim widespread vote rig support howev say bring much need stabil region islam milit rise also credit promot interethn accord push harsh reform

868,1731,guantanamo pair s passport ban the government has written to two of the british men freed from guantanamo bay telling them they will not be allowed passports.  a letter sent to martin mubanga said his british passport would not be issued in the light of evidence gathered against him by the us. this suggested he was likely to take part in action against uk or allied targets if he left britain  it said. an identical letter has been sent to feroz abbasi  the men s solicitor says.  it is not known whether the other two men released from the cuba detention camp in january - richard belmar and moazzam begg - have also received letters. the government is implementing the rarely used royal prerogative in order to withdraw the men s passports. it is only the 13th time the power has been used since 1947 - the last time was in 1976. the letter  from the home office  says:  i am writing to inform you that on the basis of the information which has come to light during your detention by the united states  the home secretary considered that there are strong grounds for believing that  on leaving the united kingdom  you would take part in activities against the united kingdom  or allied targets.   the home office said it could not comment on individual cases.  the liberal democrats say they suspect the move is part of a package of security measures agreed with the us in order for the men to be allowed home from guantanamo bay.  home affairs spokesman mark oaten also demanded assurances that the evidence against the men was not gained under torture. he added:  the power should only be used in absolute extreme circumstances and i find it hard to believe that these conditions have been met this time.  he said the move also raised complex questions about the use of the royal prerogative. the liberal democrats have promised to raise the issue in parliament.  amnesty international uk also questioned whether the decisions had been based on  torture evidence  obtained at guantanamo bay.  furthermore  we believe there should be an investigation into the role played by the uk in the detention of uk residents and nationals and possibly many others at guantanamo bay   said director kate allen. the men s solicitor  louise christian  has raised questions about whether the evidence was gathered through torture. but the pentagon told bbc news us policy  condemns and prohibits  torture and said there was no evidence that any british detainee was tortured or abused. mr abbasi  23  from croydon  south london  was taken to guantanamo bay after being captured in afghanistan in 2001. mr mubanga  29  from north london  was originally detained in zambia.,guantanamo pair passport ban govern write two british men freed guantanamo bay tell allow passport letter sent martin mubanga say british passport would issu light evid gather u suggest like take part action uk alli target left britain say ident letter sent feroz abbasi men solicitor say know whether two men releas cuba detent camp januari richard belmar moazzam begg also receiv letter govern implement rare use royal prerog order withdraw men passport th time power use sinc last time letter home offic say write inform basi inform come light detent unit state home secretari consid strong ground believ leav unit kingdom would take part activ unit kingdom alli target home offic say could comment individu case liber democrat say suspect move part packag secur measur agre u order men allow home guantanamo bay home affair spokesman mark oaten also demand assur evid men gain tortur ad power use absolut extrem circumst find hard believ condit met time say move also rais complex question use royal prerog liber democrat promis rais issu parliament amnesti intern uk also question whether decis base tortur evid obtain guantanamo bay furthermor believ investig role play uk detent uk resid nation possibl mani other guantanamo bay say director kate allen men solicitor louis christian rais question whether evid gather tortur pentagon told bbc news u polici condemn prohibit tortur say evid british detaine tortur abus mr abbasi croydon south london take guantanamo bay captur afghanistan mr mubanga north london origin detain zambia
869,458,podcasts mark rise of diy radio an apple ipod or other digital music players can hold anything up to 10 000 songs  which is a lot of space to fill.  but more and more ipod owners are filling that space with audio content created by an unpredictable assortment of producers. it is called  podcasting  and its strongest proponent is former mtv host and vj (video jockey) adam curry. podcasting takes its name from the apple ipod  although you do not need an ipod to create one or to listen to a podcast. a podcast is basically an internet-based radio show which podcasters create  usually in the comfort of their own home. they need only a microphone  a pc  and some editing software. they then upload their shows to the internet and others can download and listen to them  all for free. using technology based on xml computer code and rss - really simple syndication - listeners can subscribe to podcasts collected automatically in a bit of software  which mr curry has pioneered. the latest mp3 files of shows can then be picked up by a music playing device automatically.  mr curry records  hosts  edits and produce a daily  40 minute podcast called the daily source code. he wants to make podcasting  the next big thing  and says it is an extension of his childhood love of radio gadgetry.  i was always into technologies and wires   he explains.  my parents gave me the radio shack 101 project kit  which allows you to build an am transmitter and subsequently an fm transmitter.  i had my mom drive me around the block  see how far it would reach on the car radio.   mr curry is american  but he grew up in the netherlands where he hosted illegal  pirate radio shows in the dutch capital. he tried university in the us  and ended up back in holland where he hosted a music video show. he spent the next seven years in new york where he worked at mtv hosting the top 20 video countdown  but spent most of his hours tinkering with this new thing called the internet.  at a certain point in 1995  i was driving in on a friday afternoon  beautiful blue sky  one of those beautiful days thinking  this is so stupid.  you know  i m going do the top 20 countdown  take the cheque  go home  and sit on the internet until three in the morning.  so  after i finished the show  i quit. i said  on air  it s been great  i ve been here for seven years at that point  there s something on the internet  i ve got to go find it  and i ll see you later.   but mr curry s technology and broadcast interests started to gel a couple of years ago when computer storage was growing exponentially and high-speed internet connections were becoming more widely available. the mp3 format also meant that people could create and upload audio more cheaply and efficiently than ever before.  most importantly  mr curry says  people across the globe were bored with the radio they were hearing.  listen to 99% of the radio that you hear today  it s radio voices  and it s fake  it s just fake.  he wanted to make it easier for people to find  real voices  on the internet. he wanted software that would automatically download new audio content directly onto players like  ipods. mr curry is not a computer programmer  so he asked others to create one for him. no one did  so he tried to write one himself. he finished it a few months ago and says it  totally sucked.  he put it up on the net as open source software and now dozens of coders and audio junkies are refining it; the result is a work in progress called  ipodder . doug kaye  a california-based podcaster  praises the former mtv vj for what he has done.  adam created a simple script that solved what we call the last mile problem. ipodder takes audio from the web and brings it all the way down to the mp3 player   he explains.  people can wake up in the morning  pick up their ipods as they go to work or before they go exercise  and discover that there s all this new content automatically put onto their players.  it is created an explosion in podcasting content and podcasters are springing up in australia  finland  brazil  even malaysia. one couple broadcasts theirs  the dawn and drew show  from wisconsin in the us  sometimes even from the comfort of their own bed. topics range from the comfort of their bed  to the latest films or music and have thousands of listeners.  already  websites are springing up that point listeners in the right direction of good podcasts.  chris mcintyre runs podcast alley and says that there are good sites out there but that not everyone has the technological know-how to simply listen.  if i were to tell my mom  or my mother-in-law to copy an xml or rss file to their podcast aggregator  they would think i was speaking a foreign language   mr mcintyre says. along with technical challenges  there may be legal challenges to podcasters who air their favourite  albeit copyrighted  music. some in podcasting also worry that too much attention may turn what they see as the  anti-radio  into something that is more like conventional broadcasting. already there is interest in podcasting from the corporate world. heineken is doing its own podcast now  and so is playboy. for his part  adam curry s pressing ahead with his own vision of what podcasting should be. he loves doing the daily source code because it is about introducing good music and cool ideas to new audiences. he has even been called the ed sullivan or johnny carson of podcasting which  he says   is a badge i ll wear with great honour.  to be the johnny carson  or ed sullivan of anything is wonderful. and you know what  you don t need a hell of a lot of talent.  you just have to be nice  have your ears open  and let people shine. and that s good for me.   clark boyd is technology

873,1978,row over  police  power for csos the police federation has said it strongly opposes giving community support officers (csos) the power to detain suspects for up to 30 minutes.  the powers - piloted in six areas - were extended to all police forces in england and wales on thursday. the federation said csos do not have the experience  training and safety equipment to deal with  potentially confrontational  situations. but the government said the move would help police  build safe communities . police federation chairman jan berry said civilian officers should act as  eyes and ears  for the police.   they should not be placed in potentially confrontational situations - which detaining someone clearly is   she said. csos can now use reasonable force to detain suspects for up to 30 minutes while they wait for police officers to arrive. the powers will be granted by chief constables of local forces. ms berry said this  dramatically changes  their original purpose - to be a visible presence combating low-level crime and anti-social behaviour. she said more powers would mean more paperwork and less time on the street.  but home office minister hazel blears defended the move saying it would give the civilian officers  just that little bit of edge . she denied their role was changing and said the new powers would not take them away from the streets.   the powers that we are bringing in are things that they need to do when they are out patrolling   she said. the home office has produced its own report on csos which it describes as  encouraging . ms blears said the study shows csos are  making a real difference  in the fight against crime. but the report also showed that the public is having difficulties distinguishing between a civilian officer and a proper officer.  shadow home secretary david davis said the research appeared to acknowledge that csos were having no discernible effect on crime figures.   while the answer is a lot more real police  the government wants to recruit 25 000 people who can t arrest anyone   he said. bbc home affairs correspondent danny shaw said the research is inconclusive. there are about 3 500 csos in england and wales but the government intends to have 25 000 on the streets by 2008 at a cost of £50m. they already have powers to hand out fines for a wide range of offences. the serious organised crime and police bill proposes extra powers to search suspects  enforce licensing offences  direct traffic and deter begging.,row polic power cso polic feder say strongli oppos give commun support offic cso power detain suspect minut power pilot six area extend polic forc england wale thursday feder say cso experi train safeti equip deal potenti confront situat govern say move would help polic build safe commun polic feder chairman jan berri say civilian offic act eye ear polic place potenti confront situat detain someon clearli say cso use reason forc detain suspect minut wait polic offic arriv power grant chief constabl local forc m berri say dramat chang origin purpos visibl presenc combat lowlevel crime antisoci behaviour say power would mean paperwork less time street home offic minist hazel blear defend move say would give civilian offic littl bit edg deni role chang say new power would take away street power bring thing need patrol say home offic produc report cso describ encourag m blear say studi show cso make real differ fight crime report also show public difficulti distinguish civilian offic proper offic shadow home secretari david davi say research appear acknowledg cso discern effect crime figur answer lot real polic govern want recruit peopl arrest anyon say bbc home affair correspond danni shaw say research inconclus cso england wale govern intend street cost £m alreadi power hand fine wide rang offenc seriou organis crime polic bill propos extra power search suspect enforc licens offenc direct traffic deter beg
874,1045,domain system scam fear a system to make it easier to create website addresses using alphabets like cyrillic could open a back door for scammers  a trade body has warned.  the internationalised domain names system has been a work in progress for years and has recently been approved by the internet electronic task force. but the uk internet forum (ukif) is concerned that the system will let scammers create fake sites more easily. the problem lies in the computer codes used to represent language.  registering names that look like that of legitimate companies but lead users to fake sites designed to steal passwords and credit card details could become a whole lot easier for determined scammers  says stephen dyer  director of ukif. domain names are the  real language  addresses of websites  rather than their internet protocol address  which is a series of numbers. they are used so people can more easily navigate the web. so-called ascii codes are used to represent european languages but for other languages a hybrid of a system called unicode is used. so  for example  website paypal could now be coded using a mixture of the latin alphabet and the russian alphabet. the resulting domain as displayed to the users would look identical to the real site as a russian  a  look just like an english  a . but the computer code would be different  and the site it would lead users to could be a fake. this is more than just a theory. a fake paypal.com has already been registered with net domain giant verisign by someone who has followed the debate around the internationalised domain name (idn) system  said mr dyer. as the idea was to prove a point rather than be malicious the fake domain has now been handed back to paypal but it sets a worrying precedent  mr dyer said.  although the idn problem is well known in technical circles  the commercial world is totally unaware how easily their websites can be faked   said mr dyer.   it is important to alert users that there is a new and invisible and almost undetectable way of diverting them to what looks like a perfectly genuine site   he added. there are solutions. for instance  browsers could spot domains that use mixed characters and display them in different colours as a warning to users. mr dyer acknowledged that it would be a huge undertaking to update all the world s browsers. another solution  to introduce idn-disabled browsers could be a case of  throwing out the baby with the bath water   he said. centr  the council of european national top level domain registries  agrees.  a rush to introduce idn-disabled browsers into the marketplace is an overly-zealous step that will harm public confidence in idns - a technology that is desperately needed in the non-english speaking world   the organisation said in a statement.,domain system scam fear system make easy creat websit address use alphabet like cyril could open back door scammer trade bodi warn internationalis domain name system work progress year recent approv internet electron task forc uk internet forum ukif concern system let scammer creat fake site easili problem lie comput code use repres languag regist name look like legitim compani lead user fake site design steal password credit card detail could becom whole lot easy determin scammer say stephen dyer director ukif domain name real languag address websit rather internet protocol address seri number use peopl easili navig web socal ascii code use repres european languag languag hybrid system call unicod use exampl websit paypal could code use mixtur latin alphabet russian alphabet result domain display user would look ident real site russian look like english comput code would differ site would lead user could fake theori fake paypalcom alreadi regist net domain giant verisign someon follow debat around internationalis domain name idn system say mr dyer idea prove point rather malici fake domain hand back paypal set worri preced mr dyer say although idn problem well know technic circl commerci world total unawar easili websit fake say mr dyer import alert user new invis almost undetect way divert look like perfectli genuin site ad solut instanc browser could spot domain use mix charact display differ colour warn user mr dyer acknowledg would huge undertak updat world browser anoth solut introduc idndis browser could case throw babi bath water say centr council european nation top level domain registri agre rush introduc idndis browser marketplac overlyzeal step harm public confid idn technolog desper need nonenglish speak world organis say statement

879,477,new foot and mouth action urged a senior tory mp has criticised agriculture department defra s  lackadaisical  approach to planning for a future foot and mouth outbreak.  public accounts committee chairman edward leigh was giving his reaction to a report by a government watchdog on lessons to be learnt from the crisis. the national audit office said defra had improved its capacity to deal with future livestock disease outbreaks. but mr leigh said the department was  dragging its heels .  that comment referred to the setting up of a scheme to share any future compensation costs with industry. he also said defra had been  dreadfully slow  in paying some of its bills dating from the foot and mouth crisis.  the outbreak  which began in 2001  led to the slaughter of 6.5 million animals  devastated many farms and rural businesses  and is estimated to have cost the uk up to £8bn.  four years after the outbreak  defra is yet to begin its planned review of some of its contractors  costs  and £40m of invoices remain unpaid   mr leigh said. mr leigh also pointed out that the introduction of an it system to help control future outbreaks had been delayed. in november it emerged european commission compensation amounted to just over a third of the money the uk government had hoped to get as reimbursement for the billions lost through the foot and mouth crisis.  ministers had hoped to get £900m from the european union vet fund to help with animal slaughter and other costs but in the end was granted £349m. that was because the uk had valued the culled animals at between  two and three times  the commission s assessment of their likely market value. national audit office chief sir john bourn said a new compensation scheme was now being looked at. on the issue of the unpaid invoices  sir john said defra had paid 97% of the £1.3bn submitted by contractors since 2001   but has not agreed a final settlement with 57 contractors pending the results of its investigations .  mr leigh said being  better prepared  would also help avoid the need for  mass funeral pyres which provided an unsettling images of the 2001 outbreak . a defra spokesman said:  we welcome the report. it acknowledges the progress the department has made since 2001 - particularly on contingency planning and our improved capacity and preparedness for combating another major disease outbreak.  however  the department is aware that there are some areas requiring further work and we are working to resolve them as soon as is practicable.,new foot mouth action urg senior torus mp criticis agricultur depart defra lackadais approach plan futur foot mouth outbreak public account committe chairman edward leigh give reaction report govern watchdog lesson learnt crisi nation audit offic say defra improv capac deal futur livestock diseas outbreak mr leigh say depart drag heel comment refer set scheme share futur compens cost industri also say defra dread slow pay bill date foot mouth crisi outbreak begin lead slaughter million anim devast mani farm rural busi estim cost uk £bn four year outbreak defra yet begin plan review contractor cost £m invoic remain unpaid mr leigh say mr leigh also point introduct system help control futur outbreak delay novemb emerg european commiss compens amount third money uk govern hope get reimburs billion lose foot mouth crisi minist hope get £m european union vet fund help anim slaughter cost end grant £m uk valu cull anim two three time commiss ass like market valu nation audit offic chief sir john bourn say new compens scheme look issu unpaid invoic sir john say defra paid £bn submit contractor sinc agre final settlement contractor pend result investig mr leigh say well prepar would also help avoid need mass funer pyre provid unsettl imag outbreak defra spokesman say welcom report acknowledg progress depart make sinc particularli conting plan improv capac prepared combat anoth major diseas outbreak howev depart awar area requir work work resolv soon practic

882,780,cuba winds back economic clock fidel castro s decision to ban all cash transactions in us dollars in cuba has once more turned the spotlight on cuba s ailing economy.  all conversions between the us dollar and cuba s  convertible  peso will from 8 november be subject to a 10% tax. cuban citizens  who receive money from overseas  and foreign visitors  who change dollars in cuba  will be affected. critics of the measure argue that it is a step backwards  reflecting the cuban president s desire to increase his control of the economy and to clamp down on private enterprise. in a live television broadcast announcing the measure  president castro s chief aide said it was necessary because of the united states  increasing  economic aggression .  the ten percent obligation applies exclusively to the dollar by virtue of the situation created by the new measures of the us government to suffocate our country   he said.  the bush administration has taken an increasingly harsh line on cuba in recent months. president bush s government  which has been a strong supporter of the 40-year-old trade embargo on cuba  introduced even tighter restrictions on cuba in may.  cubans living in the us are now limited to one visit to cuba every three years and they can only send money to their immediate relatives. a leading expert on the cuban economy says that castro s tax plan smacks more of a desperate economic measure than a political gesture.  i think it is primarily an effort to raise some cash   says jose barrionuevo  head of strategy for latin american emerging markets for barclays capital.  it underscores the fact that the economy is in very bad shape and the government is looking for sources of revenue.   the tax will hit the families of cuban exiles hardest as they benefit from the money their displaced relatives send home. this money  known as remittances  can amount to as much as $1bn a year. those remaining in cuba will have to pay the tax. their relatives abroad may choose to send money in other currencies which are not subject to the tax  such as euros  or increase their dollar payments to compensate. however  many of cuban s poorest citizens could be worse off as a result. the tax will also affect the two million tourists who visit cuba every year  particularly those americans who continue to defy a ban on travel there.  cuba s tourist industry has been one of its few economic success stories over the last ten years and  according to the un economic commission for latin america  is now worth $3bn to the country.  the tax is designed to provide much-needed revenue for cuba s cash-strapped economy. cuba badly needs dollars to pay for essential items such as food  fuel and medicine. much of cuba s basic infrastructure is in a state of disrepair. in recent weeks  cuba has suffered its most serious power cuts in a decade and there have also been water shortages in parts of the island. cuba s economy had staged a modest recovery during the mid 1990s as the collapse of the soviet union forced it to embrace foreign capital  decentralise trade and permit limited private enterprise. however  a decline in foreign tourism since 2002  periodic hurricanes and the increasing costs of importing oil have put a strain on the economy. it has however yet to be seen if the tax will provide a solution to the government s economic problems. the tax could fuel an active black market in currency trading  mr barrionuevo said.  the main impact could be that it will create a black market which you typically see in countries  like venezuela  which have restrictions on capital   he says. mr barrioneuvo says the measure could be dropped if it has a damaging effect on economic activity.  it is intended to be a permanent measure but i am not sure it can last too long.,cuba wind back econom clock fidel castro decis ban cash transact u dollar cuba turn spotlight cuba ail economi convers u dollar cuba convert peso novemb subject

887,980,budget to set scene for election gordon brown will seek to put the economy at the centre of labour s bid for a third term in power when he delivers his ninth budget at 1230 gmt. he is expected to stress the importance of continued economic stability  with low unemployment and interest rates. the chancellor is expected to freeze petrol duty and raise the stamp duty threshold from £60 000. but the conservatives and lib dems insist voters face higher taxes and more means-testing under labour.  treasury officials have said there will not be a pre-election giveaway  but mr brown is thought to have about £2bn to spare.  - increase in the stamp duty threshold from £60 000   - a freeze on petrol duty   - an extension of tax credit scheme for poorer families   - possible help for pensioners the stamp duty threshold rise is intended to help first time buyers - a likely theme of all three of the main parties  general election manifestos. ten years ago  buyers had a much greater chance of avoiding stamp duty  with close to half a million properties  in england and wales alone  selling for less than £60 000. since then  average uk property prices have more than doubled while the starting threshold for stamp duty has not increased. tax credits as a result  the number of properties incurring stamp duty has rocketed as has the government s tax take. the liberal democrats unveiled their own proposals to raise the stamp duty threshold to £150 000 in february.  the tories are also thought likely to propose increased thresholds  with shadow chancellor oliver letwin branding stamp duty a  classic labour stealth tax . the tories say whatever the chancellor gives away will be clawed back in higher taxes if labour is returned to power. shadow treasury chief secretary george osborne said:  everyone who looks at the british economy at the moment says there has been a sharp deterioration in the public finances  that there is a black hole   he said.  if labour is elected there will be a very substantial tax increase in the budget after the election  of the order of around £10bn.   but mr brown s former advisor ed balls  now a parliamentary hopeful  said an examination of tory plans for the economy showed there would be a £35bn difference in investment by the end of the next parliament between the two main parties. he added:  i don t accept there is any need for any changes to the plans we have set out to meet our spending commitments.   for the lib dems david laws said:  the chancellor will no doubt tell us today how wonderfully the economy is doing   he said.  but a lot of that is built on an increase in personal and consumer debt over the last few years - that makes the economy quite vulnerable potentially if interest rates ever do have to go up in a significant way.  snp leader alex salmond said his party would introduce a £2 000 grant for first time buyers  reduce corporation tax and introduce a citizens pension free from means testing. plaid cymru s economics spokesman adam price said he wanted help to get people on the housing ladder and an increase in the minimum wage to £5.60 an hour.,budget set scene elect gordon brown seek put economi centr labour bid third term power deliv ninth budget gmt expect stress import continu econom stabil low unemploy interest rate chancellor expect freez petrol duti rais stamp duti threshold £ conserv lib dem insist voter face high tax meanstest labour treasuri offici say preelect giveaway mr brown thought £bn spare increas stamp duti threshold £ freez petrol duti extens tax credit scheme poorer famili possibl help pension stamp duti threshold rise intend help first time buyer like theme three main parti gener elect manifesto ten year ago buyer much great chanc avoid stamp duti close half million properti england wale alon sell less £ sinc averag uk properti price doubl start threshold stamp duti increas tax credit result number properti incur stamp duti rocket govern tax take liber democrat unveil propos rais stamp duti threshold £ februari torus also thought like propos increas threshold shadow chancellor oliv letwin brand stamp duti classic labour stealth tax torus say whatev chancellor give away claw back high tax labour return power shadow treasuri chief secretari georg osborn say everyon look british economi moment say sharp deterior public financ black hole say labour elect substanti tax increas budget elect order around £bn mr brown former advisor ed ball parliamentari hope say examin torus plan economi show would £bn differ invest end next parliament two main parti ad accept need chang plan set meet spend commit lib dem david law say chancellor doubt tell u today wonder economi say lot built increas person consum debt last year make economi quit vulner potenti interest rate ever go signific way snp leader alex salmond say parti would introduc £ grant first time buyer reduc corpor tax introduc citizen pension free mean test plaid cymru econom spokesman adam price say want help get peopl hous ladder increas minimum wage £ hour

891,1879,wales hails new superstar one game into his six nations career  and gavin henson is already a welsh legend.  a mesmeric display against england  topped off by his howitzer of a match-winning penalty  has secured life membership of that particular club. at 23  henson has the rugby world at his silver-booted feet. and if his natural self-assurance and swagger is shared by his wales team-mates  then a full-blown revival could be more than just a lot of hot air drifting up from the valleys. the  red dragonhood  subdued the  red rose army  in most areas of the field  but henson s stellar performance ensured their efforts yielded the win they craved above all others. he announced himself in the game s opening salvo with a  welcome to cardiff  greeting for mark cueto on the gain line. and his defence was a major feature of the match  his principal victim poor old  or rather young  mathew tait. the england centre will have spent his 19th birthday on sunday shuddering at the memory of how he was up-ended not just once  but twice  by henson s all-enveloping tackles.  the second time  after the interval  single-handedly lifted the record millennium stadium crowd at a time when england were starting to show menace. showing awesome strength  henson nonchantly held the bewildered debutant in mid-air  a master predator toying with his helpless prey  savouring the kill. his kicking game also prospered  particularly when he moved to full-back for 10 minutes either side of half-time when his captain gareth thomas was in the sin-bin. one huge clearance from tait s kick sent england retreating rapidly while another booming punt to the right corner kept the visitors pinned in their own half. henson was also creativity personified: one little chip ahead for shane williams narrowly missed its target; a precise cross-kick forcing jamie noon to fumble the ball into touch. he also had a hand in the game s only try  finished superbly by williams  and might have scored himself on the half-hour as he glided into space  only to be scragged by tait. henson was twice repelled as wales laid siege to the english line after charlie hodgson s penalty had edged the visitors in front for the first time. but he was not to be denied as the crescendo rose to a deafening din  and the outcome of the match fell to him. replacement gareth cooper made the most of a poor welsh scrum by chipping into space  where jason robinson was penalised for holding on in the tackle.  five metres in from the right touchline  44 metres out  it was not a kick stephen jones  who had seen a long-range effort fall agonisingly under the bar  would have approached with confidence.  it was out of steve s range but i looked at gavin  and he gave me a reassuring nod   said thomas. henson  surveying his date with destiny  positively relished the responsibility  and the chance to make himself a hero. without further ado  he nervelessly slotted the kick that ended five years of english dominance and 12 years of waiting in cardiff.  i knew i was going to get it before i even took the kick   he said later  his distinct spikey locks freshly gelled into an appropriate star shape.  i have been getting them from that distance all year so it wasn t a problem.  there were still four minutes for wales to hold out  and the frenzy was such that henson could not even hear jones shouting instructions at him from three yards away. but it was wales who finished the game on the attack  almost snatching a second try in a thunderous climax.  just do it  implored the front page headline on saturday s western mail newspaper. and  thanks to henson  wales did.,wale hail new superstar one game six nation career gavin henson alreadi welsh legend mesmer display england top howitz matchwin penalti secur life membership particular club henson rugbi world silverboot foot natur selfassur swagger share wale teammat fullblown reviv could lot hot air drift valley red dragonhood subdu red rise armi area field henson stellar perform ensur effort yield win crave other announc game open salvo welcom cardiff greet mark cueto gain line defenc major featur match princip victim poor old rather young mathew tait england centr spent th birthday sunday shudder memori upend twice henson allenvelop tackl second time interv singlehandedli lift record millennium stadium crowd time england start show menac show awesom strength henson nonchantli held bewild debut midair master predat toy helpless prey savour kill kick game also prosper particularli move fullback minut either side halftim captain gareth thoma sinbin one huge clearanc tait kick sent england retreat rapidli anoth boom punt right corner kept visitor pin half henson also creativ personifi one littl chip ahead shane william narrowli miss target precis crosskick forc jami noon fumbl ball touch also hand game tri finish superbl william might score halfhour glide space scrag tait henson twice repel wale laid sieg english line charli hodgson penalti edg visitor front first time deni crescendo rise deafen din outcom match fell replac gareth cooper make poor welsh scrum chip space jason robinson penalis hold tackl five metr right touchlin metr kick stephen jone see longrang effort fall agonisingli bar would approach confid steve rang look gavin give reassur nod say thoma henson survey date destini posit relish respons chanc make hero without ado nervelessli slot kick end five year english domin year wait cardiff knew go get even take kick say later distinct spikey lock freshli gell appropri star shape get distanc year problem still four minut wale hold frenzi henson could even hear jone shout instruct three yard away wale finish game attack almost snatch second tri thunder climax implor front page headlin saturday western mail newspap thank henson wale

893,2019,uk plan to deport terror suspects deals are being sought to allow the uk to deport terror suspects to their home countries without risk of them being tortured or sentenced to death.  home secretary charles clarke told the times he hoped agreement with several countries could be reached. the move follows a law lords judgement that the detention of 12 men at belmarsh prison  london  and woodhill  milton keynes  was unlawful. the 12 affected by the ruling are from algeria  tunisia  egypt and jordan. the government was told that using anti-terror legislation brought in after 11 september to hold the men indefinitely without charge broke human rights laws.  mr clarke told the times:  i think we should be prosecuting much more energetically our ability to deport the individuals concerned to the countries from which they come.  he said it was a route that was being pursued in collaboration with foreign secretary jack straw  in a very positive way . mr clarke said that he was seeking  memorandums of understanding  between overseas governments and britain to ensure suspects would not be subjected to the death penalty on their return. however  he added:  i do not think the solution to the law lords  judgement for this government is in deportations  but they will help.  there are other strands that we have to do.  but the liberal democrat s shadow home secretary  mark oaten  accused mr clarke of avoiding the main issue with the belmarsh detainees.   the critical issue that the home secretary is dodging at this stage is to deal with the very principle  to deal with how we tackle this problem in the future   he told bbc news.  and i do want him to grasp those issues and that means looking at how we can actually secure convictions in this country allowing  for example  intercept communications  telephone tapping to be included   mr oaten said.  deportation may tackle this initial problem but i want to see a wider debate urgently about how we can actually get trials and convictions in this country.   unless we get that  the liberal democrats will vote against this measure when it comes for renewal in march.   the bbc s home affairs correspondent  daniel sandford  said it appeared mr clarke was putting more emphasis on the possibility of deportation than his predecessor  david blunkett. but he said reaching an understanding with some of the detainees  home countries could be difficult.  some of these people are accused of very  very serious crimes in their home countries so it s not an easy agreement to get and i think for some of these suspects it won t be the solution.  daniel sandford said ministers may try to put forward other solutions - such as allowing more secret evidence to be put into normal criminal trials or developing a more secret trials process - in the next few weeks.  the government may try and deport some of them and then those that are left see if they can work out some way of putting them on trial   he said.,uk plan deport terror suspect deal sought allow uk deport terror suspect home countri without risk tortur sentenc death home secretari charl clark told time hope agreement sever countri could reach move follow law lord judgement detent men belmarsh prison london woodhil milton keyn unlaw affect rule algeria tunisia egypt jordan govern told use antiterror legisl brought septemb hold men indefinit without charg broke human right law mr clark told time think prosecut much energet abil deport individu concern countri come say rout pursu collabor foreign secretari jack straw posit way mr clark say seek memorandum understand oversea govern britain ensur suspect would subject death penalti return howev ad think solut law lord judgement govern deport help strand liber democrat shadow home secretari mark oaten accus mr clark avoid main issu belmarsh detaine critic issu home secretari dodg stage deal principl deal tackl problem futur told bbc news want grasp issu mean look actual secur convict countri allow exampl intercept commun telephon tap includ mr oaten say deport may tackl initi problem want see wider debat urgent actual get trial convict countri unless get liber democrat vote measur come renew march bbc home affair correspond daniel sandford say appear mr clark put emphasi possibl deport predecessor david blunkett say reach understand detaine home countri could difficult peopl accus seriou crime home countri easi agreement get think suspect solut daniel sandford say minist may tri put forward solut allow secret evid put normal crimin trial develop secret trial process next week govern may tri deport left see work way put trial say
894,1523,fed chief warning on us deficit federal reserve chairman alan greenspan has warned that allowing huge us budget deficits to continue could have  severe  consequences.  speaking to the house budget committee he urged congress to take action to cut the deficit  such as increasing taxes. while the us economy is growing at a  reasonably good pace  he warned that budget concerns were clouding the economic outlook for the us. pension and healthcare costs posed the greatest risks to the economy  he said.  the government program faces severe financial strains in coming decades as the massive baby-boom generation retires.  i fear that we may have already committed more physical resources to the baby-boom generation in its retirement years than our economy has the capacity to deliver. if existing promises need to be changed  those changes should be made sooner rather than later   mr greenspan said. he also warned that unless the nation sees unprecedented rises in productivity  retirement and health programmes would need  significant  changes. he called on congress to cut promised benefits for retirees  as the promised benefits for the soon-to-retire baby boom generation were much larger than the government could afford.  meanwhile any move to narrow the deficit gap by raising taxes could pose a significant risk to the economy by dampening growth and spending  he added. he also urged congress to reinstate lapsed rules that require tax cuts and spending to be offset elsewhere in the budget in an effort to prevent the us heading further into the red. despite the dire warnings  mr greenspan did offer some good news for the short term. as us growth gathers steam and incomes rise that should lead to a narrowing of the deficit. recent increases in defence and homeland security spending were also not expected to continue indefinitely  which should cut some costs. since president george w bush came to office the federal budget has swung from a record surplus to a record deficit of $412bn last year.,fed chief warn u deficit feder reserv chairman alan greenspan warn allow huge u budget deficit continu could sever consequ speak hous budget committe urg congress take action cut deficit increas tax u economi grow reason good pace warn budget concern cloud econom outlook u pension healthcar cost pose great risk economi say govern program face sever financi strain come decad massiv babyboom gener retir fear may alreadi commit physic resourc babyboom gener retir year economi capac deliv exist promis need chang chang make sooner rather later mr greenspan say also warn unless nation see unpreced rise product retir health programm would need signific chang call congress cut promis benefit retire promis benefit soontoretir babi boom gener much large govern could afford meanwhil move narrow deficit gap rais tax could pose signific risk economi dampen growth spend ad also urg congress reinstat lap rule requir tax cut spend offset elsewher budget effort prevent u head red despit dire warn mr greenspan offer good news short term u growth gather steam incom rise lead narrow deficit recent increas defenc homeland secur spend also expect continu indefinit cut cost sinc presid georg w bush come offic feder budget swung record surplu record deficit bn last year
895,1088,us interest rates increased to 2% us interest rates are to rise for the fourth time in five months  in a widely anticipated move.  the federal reserve has raised its key federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point to 2% in light of mounting evidence that the us economy is regaining steam. us companies created twice as many jobs as expected in october while exports hit record levels in september. analysts said a clear-cut victory for president bush in last week s election paved the way for a rise. another rise could be in store for december  some economists warned.  the fed s open market committee - which sets interest rate policy in the us - voted unanimously in favour of a quarter point rise. the fed has been gradually easing rates up since the summer  with quarter percentage point rises in june  august and september.  the central bank has been acting to restrain inflationary pressures while being careful not to obstruct economic growth. the fed did not rule out raising rates once again in december but noted that any future increases would take place at a  measured  pace. in a statement  the fed said that long-term inflation pressures remained  well contained  while the us economy appeared to be  growing at a moderate pace despite the rise in energy prices . financial analysts broadly welcomed the fed s move and shares traded largely flat. the dow jones industrial average closed down 0.89 points  or 0.01%  at 10 385.48.  recent evidence has pointed to an upturn in the us economy. us firms created 337 000 jobs last month  twice the amount expected  while exports reached record levels in september. the economy grew 3.7% in the third quarter  slower than forecast  but an improvement on the 3.3% growth seen in the second quarter. analysts claimed the fed s assessment of future economic growth was a positive one but stressed that the jury was still out on the prospect of a further rise in december.   let s wait until we see how growth and employment bear up under the fourth quarter s energy price drag before concluding that the fed has more work to do in 2005   said avery shenfeld  senior economist at cibc world markets.   i think the federal reserve does not want to rock the boat and is using a gradual approach in raising the interest rate   said sung won sohn  chief us economist for wells fargo bank.  the economy is doing a bit better right now but there are still some concerns about geopolitics  employment and the price of oil   he added. the further rise in us rates is unlikely to have a direct bearing on uk monetary policy. the bank of england (boe) has kept interest rates on hold at 4.75% for the past three months  leading some commentators to argue that rates may have peaked. in a report published on wednesday  the bank said that with rates at their current level  inflation would rise to its 2% target within two years. however  boe governor mervyn king warned only last month that the era of consistently low inflation and low unemployment may be coming to an end.,u interest rate increas u interest rate rise fourth time five month wide anticip move feder reserv rais key feder fund rate quarter percentag point light mount evid u economi regain steam u compani creat twice mani job expect octob export hit record level septemb analyst say clearcut victori presid bush last week elect pave way rise anoth rise could store decemb economist warn fed open market committe set interest rate polici u vote unanim favour quarter point rise fed gradual ea rate sinc summer quarter percentag point rise june august septemb central bank act restrain inflationari pressur care obstruct econom growth fed rule rais rate decemb note futur increas would take place measur pace statement fed say longterm inflat pressur remain well contain u economi appear grow moder pace despit rise energi price financi analyst broadli welcom fed move share trade larg flat dow jone industri averag close point recent evid point upturn u economi u firm creat job last month twice amount expect export reach record level septemb economi grow third quarter slow forecast improv growth see second quarter analyst claim fed ass futur econom growth posit one stress juri still prospect rise decemb let wait see growth employ bear fourth quarter energi price drag conclud fed work say averi shenfeld senior economist cibc world market think feder reserv want rock boat use gradual approach rais interest rate say sung sohn chief u economist well fargo bank economi bit well right still concern geopolit employ price oil ad rise u rate unlik direct bear uk monetari polici bank england boe kept interest rate hold past three month lead comment argu rate may peak report publish wednesday bank say rate current level inflat would rise target within two year howev boe governor mervyn king warn last month era consist low inflat low unemploy may come end

897,883,web logs aid disaster recovery some of the most vivid descriptions of the devastation in southern asia are on the internet - in the form of web logs or blogs.  bloggers have been offering snapshots of information from around the region and are also providing some useful information for those who want to help. indian writer rohit gupta edits a group blog called dogs without borders. when he created it  the site was supposed to be a forum to discuss relations between india and pakistan. but in the wake of sunday s tsunami  mr gupta and his fellow bloggers switched gears.  they wanted to blog the tsunami and its aftermath. one sri lankan blogger in the group goes by the online name morquendi. with internet service disrupted by the tsunami  morquendi started sending sms text messages via cell phone from the affected areas of sri lanka.  we started publishing these smses   says mr gupta.   morquendi was describing scenes like 1 600 bodies washed up on a shore  and people burying  and burying and burying them. people digging holes with their hands. and this was coming through an sms message.  we didn t have visual accounts on radio or on tv  or in the print media.  soon  thousands of web users around the world were logging on to read morquendi s first hand accounts. in one message  morquendi wrote about a sri lankan woman who was running home with a friend when the wave hit.  she was being swept away   morquendi s message read.  she grabbed a tree with one hand and her friend with the other. she says she watched the water pull her friend away.  mr gupta says the power of morquendi s text message blogs was palpable.  he was running around  looking for friends  burying bodies  carrying bodies   mr gupta says of morquendi.  i can t even begin to imagine the psychological state he was in when he was sending us reports  and doing the relief work at the same time.  he was caught between being a journalist and being a human being.   others blogs are helping to spread information about relief efforts. dina mehta is an indian blogger who s helping with the newly created south east asia earthquake and tsunami blog. she says the blog is not meant to be filled with first person accounts.  what we re doing is we re building a resource   she says.  anyone who says  ok  i want to come and do some work in india  volunteer in india  or in sri lanka or malaysia  this is the sort of one-stop-shop that they can come to for all sorts of resources - emergency help lines  relief agencies  aid agencies  contacts for them etc.   ms mehta also says she wishes that governments in the region would realise the power of blogs.  imagine if they had this resource available to them  if there was a disaster  how quickly you could funnel aid in  and get people to help   she says. bloggers in the united states are also getting involved. ramdhan yadav kotamaraja is originally from india  but now lives in dallas. mr kotamaraja wanted to help those affected by the tsunami by pooling money with concerned friends. so  he set up an online payment system on his website. then  says mr kotamaraja  the blogging world found out.  all my blogger friends started linking up my site  and i saw a lot of people other than my friends. i d say 70% of the donations came from people i don t know.  it s simply unbelievable to me  that people that i don t know will come and start donating.  news spreads quickly on weblogs  a phenomenon that helps bloggers expand their audience and scope. in sri lanka  blogger morquendi is recruiting others to help. one recruit calls himself heretic. in one of his latest posts  heretic asks:  have you ever seen fishing trawlers on the road  ever seen a bus inside a house   well   heretic writes   that was just the least affected areas - so you can just imagine - or can you   he concludes:  keep it blogged.   clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world  a bbc world service and wgbh-boston co-production.,web log aid disast recoveri vivid descript devast southern asia internet form web log blog blogger offer snapshot inform around region also provid use inform want help indian writer rohit gupta edit group blog call dog without border creat site suppos forum discus relat india pakistan wake sunday tsunami mr gupta fellow blogger switch gear want blog tsunami aftermath one sri lankan blogger group goe onlin name morquendi internet servic disrupt tsunami morquendi start send sm text messag via cell phone affect area sri lanka start publish smse say mr gupta morquendi describ scene like bodi wash shore peopl buri buri buri peopl dig hole hand come sm messag visual account radio tv print medium soon thousand web user around world log read morquendi first hand account one messag morquendi write sri lankan woman run home friend wave hit swept away morquendi messag read grab tree one hand friend say watch water pull friend away mr gupta say power morquendi text messag blog palpabl run around look friend buri bodi carri bodi mr gupta say morquendi even begin imagin psycholog state send u report relief work time caught journalist human other blog help spread inform relief effort dina mehta indian blogger help newli creat south east asia earthquak tsunami blog say blog meant fill first person account build resourc say anyon say ok want come work india volunt india sri lanka malaysia sort onestopshop come sort resourc emerg help line relief agenc aid agenc contact etc m mehta also say wish govern region would realis power blog imagin resourc avail disast quickli could funnel aid get peopl help say blogger unit state also get involv ramdhan yadav kotamaraja origin india live dalla mr kotamaraja want help affect tsunami pool money concern friend set onlin payment system websit say mr kotamaraja blog world found blogger friend start link site saw lot peopl friend say donat come peopl know simpli unbeliev peopl know come start donat news spread quickli weblog phenomenon help blogger expand audienc scope sri lanka blogger morquendi recruit other help one recruit call heret one late post heret ask ever see fish trawler road ever see bu insid hous well heret write least affect area imagin conclud keep blog clark boyd technolog correspond world bbc world servic wgbhboston coproduct

899,1688,immigration to be election issue immigration and asylum have normally been issues politicians from the big parties have tiptoed around at election time.  but no longer. both labour and the tories have signalled their intention of making them central to their election campaigns. they have been struck by the level of concern amongst voters about the issues  with internal surveys showing they have the potential to swing large numbers of votes. that was also true at the last general election and the issue did briefly become a campaigning issue. but it sparked the probably predictable furore with claims politicians were either stoking up xenophobia or  alternatively  running scared of addressing the problem. but this time around it looks set to be one of the core battlegrounds with both the big parties competing to set out tough policies.  the tories are already committed to imposing annual limits on immigration  with a quota for asylum seekers and with applications processed outside the uk. labour has already branded the proposal unworkable but party strategists have seen the tories seizing a poll advantage over the issue.  now home secretary charles clarke has come up with alternative proposals for a points system to ensure only immigrants who can benefit the economy will be granted entry  and to kick out more failed asylum seekers. that has been attacked by the tories as too little  too late and for failing to tackle the key issue of the numbers entering the uk. the liberal democrats have not been drawn too deeply into the argument but have called for a europe-wide policy on immigration.  but  while all the parties appear to agree the time has come to properly debate and address the issue  there are already signs they will run into precisely the same problems as before. former union leader sir bill morris has already accused both the big parties of engaging in a  bidding war about who can be nastiest to asylum seekers .   my concern is that  whilst the labour party and the conservative party will take a constructive approach to the debate  right-wing political parties  picking up on statements like `burden to britain  will exploit this and create a lot of fear and uncertainty . it is precisely that concern - and the possible suggestion the issue is playing to the far right s racist agenda - that will provoke strong reactions from many concerned with this issue. the challenge for the big parties is to ensure they can engage in the debate during the cut and thrust of a general election while also avoiding that trap.,immigr elect issu immigr asylum normal issu politician big parti tipto around elect time longer labour torus signal intent make central elect campaign struck level concern amongst voter issu intern survey show potenti swing larg number vote also true last gener elect issu briefli becom campaign issu spark probabl predict furor claim politician either stoke xenophobia altern run scare address problem time around look set one core battleground big parti compet set tough polici torus alreadi commit impos annual limit immigr quota asylum seeker applic process outsid uk labour alreadi brand propos unwork parti strategist see torus seiz poll advantag issu home secretari charl clark come altern propos point system ensur immigr benefit economi grant entri kick fail asylum seeker attack torus littl late fail tackl key issu number enter uk liber democrat drawn deepli argument call europewid polici immigr parti appear agre time come properli debat address issu alreadi sign run precis problem former union leader sir bill morri alreadi accus big parti engag bid war nasty asylum seeker concern whilst labour parti conserv parti take construct approach debat rightw polit parti pick statement like burden britain exploit creat lot fear uncertainti precis concern possibl suggest issu play far right racist agenda provok strong reaction mani concern issu challeng big parti ensur engag debat cut thrust gener elect also avoid trap
900,61,telegraph newspapers axe 90 jobs the daily and sunday telegraph newspapers are axing 90 journalist jobs - 17% of their editorial staff.  the telegraph group says the cuts are needed to fund an £150m investment in new printing facilities. journalists at the firm met on friday afternoon to discuss how to react to the surprise announcement. the cuts come against a background of fierce competition for readers and sluggish advertising revenues amid competition from online advertising. the national union of journalists has called on the management to recall the notice of redundancy by midday on monday or face a strike ballot.  pearson s financial times said last week it was offering voluntary redundancy to about 30 reporters.  the national union of journalists said it stood strongly behind the journalists and did not rule out a strike.  managers have torn up agreed procedures and kicked staff in the teeth by sacking people to pay for printing facilities   said jeremy dear  nuj general secretary. nuj official barry fitzpatrick said the company had ignored the 90-day consultation period required for companies planning more than 10 redundancies.  they have shown a complete disregard for the consultative rights of our members   said mr fitzpatrick  who added that the company now planned to observe the consultation procedures. the two telegraph titles currently employ 521 journalists.  some broadsheet newspapers - especially those which have not moved to a tabloid format - have suffered circulation declines  which are hitting revenues. the telegraph has announced no plans to go tabloid although both the independent and the times have seen circulation rise since shrinking in size.  the guardian is hedging its bets  planning a larger tabloid format like those popular in continental europe. the telegraph group was bought by the barclay twins - frederick and david - last year  having previously been owned by lord conrad black s hollinger international. the brothers are currently mulling the sale of another of their businesses  retailer littlewoods.  telegraph executive murdoch maclennan said the two newspapers would add eight colour pages in the coming months.   journalists are the lifeblood of any newspaper  and maintaining the quality of the daily telegraph and the sunday telegraph for our readers is vital   he said.  however  action to improve our production capability and secure our titles against the competition is also vital.  many newspapers are investing in new printing machinery that enables them to print more colour pages  or in some cases  have colour on every page. they are hoping that by boosting colour it will make their publications more attractive to advertisers and readers alike. in recent months news corp s news international unit  which publishes the sun and the news of the world  the guardian media group  trinity mirror and the daily mail & general trust have all announced substantial investments in new printing plants.,telegraph newspap axe job daili sunday telegraph newspap axe journalist job editori staff telegraph group say cut need fund £m invest new print facil journalist firm met friday afternoon discus react surpris announc cut come background fierc competit reader sluggish advertis revenu amid competit onlin advertis nation union journalist call manag recal notic redund midday monday face strike ballot pearson financi time say last week offer voluntari redund report nation union journalist say stood strongli behind journalist rule strike manag torn agre procedur kick staff teeth sack peopl pay print facil say jeremi dear nuj gener secretari nuj offici barri fitzpatrick say compani ignor day consult period requir compani plan redund show complet disregard consult right member say mr fitzpatrick ad compani plan observ consult procedur two telegraph titl current employ journalist broadsheet newspap especi move tabloid format suffer circul declin hit revenu telegraph announc plan go tabloid although independ time see circul rise sinc shrink size guardian hedg bet plan large tabloid format like popular continent europ telegraph group bought barclay twin frederick david last year previous own lord conrad black holling intern brother current mull sale anoth busi retail littlewood telegraph execut murdoch maclennan say two newspap would add eight colour page come month journalist lifeblood newspap maintain qualiti daili telegraph sunday telegraph reader vital say howev action improv product capabl secur titl competit also vital mani newspap invest new print machineri enabl print colour page case colour everi page hope boost colour make public attract advertis reader alik recent month news corp news intern unit publish sun news world guardian medium group triniti mirror daili mail gener trust announc substanti invest new print plant
901,970,steel firm  to cut  45 000 jobs mittal steel  one of the world s largest steel producers  could cut up to 45 000 jobs over the next five years  its chief executive has said.  the netherlands-based company is due to complete its $4.5bn acquisition of us firm isg next month  making it one of the largest global firms of its kind. however  lakshmi mittal has told investors the combined company will have to shed thousands of jobs. the indian-born magnate did not say where the job losses would fall.  mr mittal told us investors that once the acquisition of international steel group was completed  the company would aim to reduce its workforce by between 7 000 and 8 000 annually. this could see its workforce trimmed from 155 000 to 110 000 staff by 2010.  we are investing in modernisation so employees will go down   mr mittal told the conference in chicago.  mittal steel was formed last year when mr mittal s lnm holdings merged with dutch firm ispat. a combination of mittal steel and isg would have annual sales of $32bn (£16.7bn; 24.1bn euros) and a production capacity of 70 million tonnes.  a mittal steel spokeman said that no decisions on job cuts have been made yet.  we are trying to create a sustainable steel industry and if we want to do that  we have to invest in new technology   a spokesman said. mittal steel has operations in 14 countries. many of its businesses - particularly those in eastern europe - were previously state owned and have huge workforces. it employs 50 000 staff in kazakhstan alone  and has large operations in romania  the czech republic  south africa and the united states.,steel firm cut job mittal steel one world large steel produc could cut job next five year chief execut say netherlandsbas compani due complet bn acquisit u firm isg next month make one large global firm kind howev lakshmi mittal told investor combin compani shed thousand job indianborn magnat say job loss would fall mr mittal told u investor acquisit intern steel group complet compani would aim reduc workforc annual could see workforc trim staff invest modernis employe go mr mittal told confer chicago mittal steel form last year mr mittal lnm hold merg dutch firm ispat combin mittal steel isg would annual sale bn £bn bn euro product capac million tonn mittal steel spokeman say decis job cut make yet tri creat sustain steel industri want invest new technolog spokesman say mittal steel oper countri mani busi particularli eastern europ previous state own huge workforc employ staff kazakhstan alon larg oper romania czech republ south africa unit state
902,918,russia gets investment blessing soaring oil sales and a budget surplus mean russian debt is no longer a risky investment  one of the world s leading credit rating agencies says.  standard & poor s has classed russian bonds as  investment grade   up from their former  speculative  rating. russia s reputation among investors has been hurt in recent months by the heavy tax bills and asset seizures imposed on companies such as oil giant yukos. s&p said the solidity of government finances outweighed the risk. russia is now a net creditor rather than a debtor. gold and foreign currency reserves of $119bn beat its foreign public debt of some $113bn.  the other two major ratings agencies - fitch and moody s have long since upped their rating of russia s sovereign debt. s&p had held back through fear that the government was dragging its feet on economic and legal reforms. now  though  it has finally followed suit. but the agency made it clear that the improved rating did not mean that the risks were a thing of the past. instead  with russian government coffers brimming with tax revenues from energy sales  s&p said the government s own debt is looking a good bet.  these improvements are so significant that they now outweight the serious and growing political risk that continues to be a key ratings constraint on russia   wrote s&p credit analyst helena hessel.  the yukos saga is the most high-profile of the political risks to which ms hessel alludes. the company s founder and ex-chief executive  mikhail khodorkovsky  is in jail on trial for tax evasion and fraud. many believe the real motive for his prosecution is that he threatened to use his wealth to set up a political alternative to president vladimir putin. his company  meanwhile  is widely believed to have fallen victim to the kremlin s wish to get russian energy resources as far as possible back under state control.,russia get invest bless soar oil sale budget surplu mean russian debt longer riski invest one world lead credit rate agenc say standard poor class russian bond invest grade former specul rate russia reput among investor hurt recent month heavi tax bill asset seizur impos compani oil giant yuko sp say solid govern financ outweigh risk russia net creditor rather debtor gold foreign currenc reserv bn beat foreign public debt bn two major rate agenc fitch moodi long sinc up rate russia sovereign debt sp held back fear govern drag foot econom legal reform though final follow suit agenc make clear improv rate mean risk thing past instead russian govern coffer brim tax revenu energi sale sp say govern debt look good bet improv signific outweight seriou grow polit risk continu key rate constraint russia write sp credit analyst helena hessel yuko saga highprofil polit risk m hessel allud compani founder exchief execut mikhail khodorkovski jail trial tax evas fraud mani believ real motiv prosecut threaten use wealth set polit altern presid vladimir putin compani meanwhil wide believ fall victim kremlin wish get russian energi resourc far possibl back state control

904,1487,wenger rules out new keeper arsenal boss arsene wenger says he has no plans to sign a new goalkeeper during the january transfer window.  wenger has brought in manuel almunia for the last three games for the out-of-form jens lehmann - but the spaniard himself has been prone to mistakes. there have been suggestions that wenger will swoop for a high-quality shot-stopper in the new year. but he told the evening standard:  i don t feel it will be necessary to bring in a new goalkeeper in january.  the gunners manager refused to comment on the difficult start that 27-year-old almunia has made to his career at highbury. and he would not be drawn on whether lehmann would return for the top-of-the table clash with chelsea on sunday.  almunia was at fault for rosenborg s goal in arsenal s 5-1 champions league win on tuesday and had some hairy moments in last week s win over birmingham. but wenger said earlier this week that his indifferent form was down to pressure caused by being under scrutiny from the media.  the debate has gone on too long. everyone has an opinion and i do not have to add to it   wenger added. arsenal have been linked with middlesbrough keeper mark schwarzer  fulham s edwin van der sar and parma s sebastien frey. and wenger has no immediate plans to recall former england under-21 international stuart taylor from his loan spell at leicester.,wenger rule new keeper arsen bos arsen wenger say plan sign new goalkeep januari transfer window wenger brought manuel almunia last three game outofform jen lehmann spaniard prone mistak suggest wenger swoop highqual shotstopp new year told even standard feel necessari bring new goalkeep januari gunner manag refus comment difficult start yearold almunia make career highburi would drawn whether lehmann would return topofth tabl clash chelsea sunday almunia fault rosenborg goal arsen champion leagu win tuesday hairi moment last week win birmingham wenger say earlier week indiffer form pressur caus scrutini medium debat go long everyon opinion add wenger ad arsen link middlesbrough keeper mark schwarzer fulham edwin van der sar parma sebastien frey wenger immedi plan recal former england under intern stuart taylor loan spell leicest

906,2069,online games play with politics after bubbling under for some time  online games broke through onto the political arena in 2004.  the us presidential election provided a showcase for many  aimed at talking directly to a generation that has grown up with joysticks and gamepads. experts say this reflects how video games are becoming a mainstream part of culture and society. the first official political campaign game was technically launched during the last week of 2003: the iowa game  commissioned by the democrat hopeful howard dean. more than 20 followed suit  including frontrunner  elections  president forever and the political machine  which allowed players to run an entire presidential campaign  including having to cope with the media. others helped raise the stakes during the bush/kerry contest by highlighting a candidate s virtues or his vices.  the phenomenon has astonished the forefathers of political games  a handful of multi-discipline games enthusiasts keen to push frontiers.   when i started researching political games at the university  about five years ago  i thought it was going to be something that would take decades to happen   said gonzalo frasca  computer games specialist at the information technology university of copenhagen.  i must admit that i was the first person to be surprised at seeing how fast they have evolved   added the uruguayan-born researcher  who has so far created games for two political campaigns. many artists and designers are experimenting with this form of gaming with an agenda in projects such as newsgaming.com. the aim is to comment on international news events via games.  the ability of games to simulate reality makes them a powerful modelling tool to interact with actual situations in an original way.   video games generate strong reactions mainly because they are new  but also because our culture needs to learn how to deal with simulation   mr frasca told the bbc news website. this was the case with the one he created for a political party in uruguay  cambiemos  an online puzzle game that offered a view on how the country s problems could be solved by working together.  it s up to us to explore what we can learn from ourselves through play and video games.  ultimately  dr frasca sees games as a small laboratory where we can play with our hopes  fears and beliefs.  children learn a lot about the world through play. there is no reason why we adults should stop doing it as we grow up.   but experts estimate it will still take at least about a decade until this new breed of video gaming communication become a common tool for political campaigns.  this is hardly surprising  compared to other forms of mass media like the worldwide web. only a few years ago  most politicians did not have a webpage  while now it is almost a must-have. dr frasca said:  political campaigns will continue to experiment with video games. they represent a new tool of communication that can reach a younger audience in a language that can clearly speak to them.   it will not replace other forms of political propaganda  but it will integrate itself on to the media ecology of political campaigns.,onlin game play polit bubbl time onlin game broke onto polit arena u presidenti elect provid showcas mani aim talk directli gener grown joystick gamepad expert say reflect video game becom mainstream part cultur societi first offici polit campaign game technic launch last week iowa game commiss democrat hope howard dean follow suit includ frontrunn elect presid forev polit machin allow player run entir presidenti campaign includ cope medium other help rais stake bushkerri contest highlight candid virtu vice phenomenon astonish forefath polit game hand multidisciplin game enthusiast keen push frontier start research polit game univers five year ago thought go someth would take decad happen say gonzalo frasca comput game specialist inform technolog univers copenhagen must admit first person surpris see fast evolv ad uruguayanborn research far creat game two polit campaign mani artist design experi form game agenda project newsgamingcom aim comment intern news event via game abil game simul realiti make power model tool interact actual situat origin way video game gener strong reaction mainli new also cultur need learn deal simul mr frasca told bbc news websit case one creat polit parti uruguay cambiemo onlin puzzl game offer view countri problem could solv work togeth u explor learn play video game ultim dr frasca see game small laboratori play hope fear belief child learn lot world play reason adult stop grow expert estim still take least decad new breed video game commun becom common tool polit campaign hardli surpris compar form mass medium like worldwid web year ago politician webpag almost musthav dr frasca say polit campaign continu experi video game repres new tool commun reach young audienc languag clearli speak replac form polit propaganda integr medium ecolog polit campaign

909,352,new consoles promise big problems making games for future consoles will require more graphic artists and more money  an industry conference has been told.  sony  microsoft and nintendo will debut their new consoles at the annual e3 games expo in los angeles in may. these so-called  next generation  machines will be faster than current consoles  and capable of displaying much higher-quality visuals. for gamers  this should make for better  more immersive games. in a pre-recorded video slot during microsoft s keynote address at the game developers conference  held last week in san francisco  famed director james cameron revealed he is making a game in tandem with his next film - believed to be battle angel alita. the game s visual quality would be  like a lucid dream   said mr cameron. but numerous speakers warned that creating such graphics will require more artists  and so next generation console games will be much more expensive to develop. the first new console  microsoft s xbox 2  is not expected to reach the shops until the end of 2005. games typically take at least 18 months to create  however  so developers are grappling with the hardware today.  according to robert walsh  head of brisbane-based game developer krome studios  next generation games will cost between $10-25m to make  with teams averaging 80 staff in size taking two years to complete a title. such sums mean it will be difficult for anyone to start a new game studio  said mr walsh.  if you re a start-up  i doubt that a publisher is going to walk in and give you a cheque for $10m  however good you are   he said. mr walsh suggested that new studios should make games for mobile phones and handheld consoles like the sony psp and the nintendo ds  since they are cheaper and easier to create than console games.  one developer bucking the trend towards big art teams is will wright  the creator of the best-selling the sims games. the founder of california s maxis studio surprised the conference with a world exclusive preview of his next game  spore. spore will allow players to experiment with the evolution of digital creatures. starting with an amoeba-sized organism  the player will guide the physical development of their creature by selecting how its limbs  jaws and other body parts evolve.  eventually the creature will become capable of establishing cities  trading and fighting  and even building space ships. advanced players will visit the home planets of creatures created by other spore players. these worlds will be automatically swapped across the internet. mr wright said that enabling players to devise and share their creatures would make them care more about the game.  i don t want to put the player in the role of luke skywalker or frodo baggins - i want them to be george lucas or dr seuss   explained mr wright. few games have hinted at the scope of spore  but mr wright explained that he has nevertheless kept his development team small by hiring expert programmers. instead of employing lots of artists to create 3d models of the digital creatures  spore generates and displays the creatures according to rules devised by the programmers.  the thing i am coming away with [from the conference] is that next generation content is going to be really expensive  and creating it will drive the smaller players out of the market   said mr wright.  i d like to offer an alternative to that.   new development tools will be another important aid in making next generation games  and dozens of companies demonstrated their latest products at the conference.  oxford-based natural motion launched endorphin v2.0  which enables artists to direct a 3d  virtual actor . the actor is realistically modelled according to the laws of physics. endorphin simulates how the actor falls down stairs  for instance  or crumples up after a gunshot. artists can blend together these visual sequences  and include the results in their games. the process is much quicker than having an artist animate each movement by hand  and so lessens the need for larger art teams. another british company aiming to reduce the workload of artists is manchester start-up genemation. its latest tool  gencrowd  enables artists to create unique  photo-realistic human faces for games involving lots of people. gencrowd works by blending together elements of an in-built supply of stock faces of differing ages and ethnicities. the software can create up to 2 000 new heads an hour.  one area not yet dominated by graphical blockbusters is mobile phone games. even the latest phones are not as powerful as the consoles of a decade ago  so smaller teams of half a dozen people can still create complete games for the devices.  the game developers conference included a special two-day summit dedicated to creating mobile games. a niche attraction for a few dozen conference attendees when it began five years ago  gdc s mobile summit this year drew several hundred delegates. mobile games are a fast-growing sector because newer phones have better graphics and sound  and are thus more suitable for playing games. furthermore  the adoption of mobile phones continues to spread across the world. it s predicted that by 2006 two billion people will own a mobile phone. the growing importance of mobile gaming was reflected by a keynote given by john batter  general manager at ea mobile. ea mobile is a division of electronic arts  the biggest games publisher. until recently electronic arts had been dismissive of games for phones.  the last time you checked  ea wasn t in this business   mr batter admitted. but he said ea now planned on dominating the market by releasing mobile versions of its most popular franchises. ea plans to release up to 20 mobile games over the next 12 months. the first will be a version of its need for speed racing game  created by ea mobile s 30-person development team. mr batter predicted that by 2006  mobile phones would be capable of running games of comparable quality to those on sony s upcoming psp handheld console.  owain bennallack is the editor of develop magazine.,new consol promis big

910,2141,celts savour grand slam prospect the six nations has heralded a new order in northern hemisphere rugby this year and wales and ireland rather than traditional big guns france and england face a potential grand slam play-off in three weeks  time.  but before that game in cardiff  wales must get past scotland at murrayfield  while ireland face the not insignificant task of a home fixture with the mercurial french. no-one knows what mood france will be in at lansdowne road on 12 march - sublime  as in the first half against wales  or ridiculous  like in the same period against england at twickenham. but how the mighty have fallen. england sat on rugby s summit 15 months ago as world champions and 2003 grand slam winners. but they have lost nine of their 14 matches since that heady night in sydney. and they face the ignominy of what could amount to a wooden spoon play-off against italy in a fortnight.  england are enduring their worst run in the championship since captain richard hill was dumped in favour of mike harrison after three straight losses in 1987. coach andy robinson  who took over from the successful sir clive woodward in september  has lost a phalanx of world cup stars. and he is enduring the toughest of teething problems in bedding down his own style with a new team. the same year that england ruled the roost  a woeful wales lost all five matches in the six nations. and they won only two games  against scotland and italy  in 2004. wales  most recent championship title was in 1994  and their last grand slam success came in 1978 in the era of gareth edwards  phil bennett  jpr williams et al.  but welsh rugby fans remain on permanent tenterhooks for the blossoming of a new golden age. after several false dawns  coach mike ruddock may have come up with the team and philosophy to match expectations. the fresh verve is inspired by skipper gareth thomas  now out with a broken thumb  accurate kicking from either fly-half stephen jones or centre gavin henson  a rampant martyn williams leading the way up front  and exciting runners in the guise of henson and shane williams. ireland coach eddie o sullivan and captain brian o driscoll have got their side buzzing too  and they are close to shedding the  nearly-men  tag that has dogged them for the past few years. the men from the emerald isle have been six nations runners-up for the past two years  to france and england.  but they have not won the title since 1985 and last clinched a grand slam in 1948. as for scotland  they have struggled this decade and the 2004 wooden spoon  winners  have not been in the top two since they lifted the title in 1999. italy continue the elusive search for their first six nations away win  and can still only account for the scalps of scotland (twice) and wales since joining the elite in 2000. coach john kirwan is a passionate and dedicated believer in the azzurri  but is lacking in raw materials. and so to france. brilliant one minute  inept the next. but the reigning champions could quite easily turn on the style in dublin and end up winning the title through the back door. ireland  though  have won three times in their last five meetings. welsh romantics would probably prefer a glorious victory in the celtic showdown to crown their grand slam. but given that ireland have beaten wales in four of their last five meetings  the welsh legions are likely to be behind les bleus on 12 march.,celt savour grand slam prospect six nation herald new order northern hemispher rugbi year wale ireland rather tradit big gun franc england

911,842,dominici backs lacklustre france wing christophe dominici says france can claim another six nations grand slam despite two lacklustre wins so far against scotland and england.  the champions only just saw off the scots in paris  then needed england to self-destruct in last week s 18-17 win.  the english played better than us but lost  whereas we are still in the race for the grand slam   said dominici.  we know our display was not perfect  but we can still win the grand slam  along with ireland and wales.  france   ireland and wales all remain unbeaten after two rounds of this year s rbs six nations  with the two celtic nations playing by far the more impressive rugby.  france take on wales at the stade de france on 26 february and ireland in dublin on 12 march. but although france have yet to click  dominici says that they can still win the hard way as long as scrum-half dimitri yachvili continues in his goalkicking form.  if we have an efficient kicker on whom we can rely on  a solid defence and a team who play for their lives  we can achieve something   dominici added.  i said at the start of the competition that the winners would be clearer from the third matches  and that s exactly what is going to happen.  france coach bernard laporte will announce his starting line-up next tuesday for the match against wales.  wing jimmy marlu is definitely out with the knee injury sustained at twickenham  which is likely to sideline him for the rest of the tournament. inspirational flanker serge betsen is a doubt with a thigh injury  but number eight imanol harinordoquy has shaken off his shoulder injury. in the backs  centre yannick jauzion and winger aurelien rougerie are all back in contention after injury  while brive back julien laharrague has received his first call-up as a replacement for pepito elhorga.,dominici back lacklustr franc wing christoph dominici say franc claim anoth six nation grand slam despit two lacklustr win far scotland england champion saw scot pari need england selfdestruct last week win english play well u lose wherea still race grand slam say dominici know display perfect still win grand slam along ireland wale franc ireland wale remain unbeaten two round year rb six nation two celtic nation play far impress rugbi franc take wale stade de franc februari ireland dublin march although franc yet click dominici say still win hard way long scrumhalf dimitri yachvili continu goalkick form effici kicker reli solid defenc team play live achiev someth dominici ad say start competit winner would clearer third match exactli go happen franc coach bernard laport announc start lineup next tuesday match wale wing jimmi marlu definit knee injuri sustain twickenham like sidelin rest tournament inspir flanker serg betsen doubt thigh injuri number eight imanol harinordoquy shaken shoulder injuri back centr yannick jauzion winger aurelien rougeri back content injuri brive back julien laharragu receiv first callup replac pepito elhorga
912,1482,tories  would cut number of mps  the conservative party would cut the number of mps by about one-fifth if they were elected  tory leader michael howard has said.  the plan forms part of the party s  smaller government bill   to be unveiled later this week. mr howard told the sunday times the party would also reduce the number of government special advisers. and he said a referendum would be held in wales to decide whether or not to scrap the welsh assembly.  the changes would all take place within five years of the conservatives winning a general election  mr howard told the paper.  the precise number of mps to go would depend on the result of the welsh referendum  but it would probably mean a reduction of around 120 from the current total of 659. if wales decided to keep its assembly it would stand to lose more mps. mr howard said as both parties planned to cut the number of civil servants at whitehall - labour by more than 80 000 and the tories by almost 100 000 - they should accept a similar drop in their own numbers.  it is all very well saying government departments should be reduced  but what about ministers  parliament and special advisers   he said. shadow leader of the commons oliver heald said:  this will be part of our aim to reduce unnecessary and costly interference in people s lives by reducing the size and role of the state .  mr howard said the plan would also even out the  great unfairness  of there being proportionately more scottish and welsh mps at westminster than those from england. the average size of an english constituency was 70 000 people  mr howard said. in northern ireland it was just over 66 000  in wales just over 59 000 and in scotland 53 000. the number of welsh mps would be set at an amount that was  consistent and fair in terms of representation with the rest of the united kingdom  if the assembly was scrapped. mr howard said the changes should be carried out quickly and could even be implemented by the election after next.  you have got to have a big bang. we don t want this like the house of lords reform  getting to one stage and then not having the next stage.,torus would cut number mp conserv parti would cut number mp onefifth elect torus leader michael howard say plan form part parti small govern bill unveil later week mr howard told sunday time parti would also reduc number govern special advis say referendum would held wale decid whether scrap welsh assembl chang would take place within five year conserv win gener elect mr howard told paper precis number mp go would depend result welsh referendum would probabl mean reduct around current total wale decid keep assembl would stand lose mp mr howard say parti plan cut number civil servant whitehal labour torus almost accept similar drop number well say govern depart reduc minist parliament special advis say shadow leader common oliv heald say part aim reduc unnecessari costli interfer peopl live reduc size role state mr howard say plan would also even great unfair proportion scottish welsh mp westminst england averag size english constitu peopl mr howard say northern ireland wale scotland number welsh mp would set amount consist fair term represent rest unit kingdom assembl scrap mr howard say chang carri quickli could even implement elect next get big bang want like hous lord reform get one stage next stage
913,2061,wenger dejected as arsenal slump arsenal manager arsene wenger claimed their display in the 3-1 defeat against bayern munich was  our worst peformance in the champions league .  kolo toure s late goal gives the gunners hope for the second leg  but wenger said:  the only positive is that we are still in the tie.  the players are really down in the dressing-room. i feel we really turned in a bad performance.  at 3-0 we faced a real struggle  but 3-1 at least gives us a chance.   goalscorer toure was also at fault for two goals  and wenger said:  we need to help toure rebuild his confidence as he is low at the moment.  wenger also tried to stay upbeat himself  adding:  but there is enough time for crying. i could cry - maybe it would be easier - but life goes on.  in this job  you have good and bad nights. this was a bad night - but i still have confidence in the quality of my players  as well as their spirit and desire.  but wenger s bayern counterpart felix magath was in no mood to celebrate either. he said:  i am far from happy despite the win. my players failed to try and score a fourth to kill the tie and then conceded the late goal.   arsenal are fully capable of scoring several goals against us on their own turf.  arsenal keeper jens lehmann  whose personal rivalry with bayern goalkeeper oliver kahn was not helped by the result  said:  do i blame myself for the third goal  as a goalkeeper  i always blame myself.  i just know the goals were very easy against us. in my time here  we have never conceded three easy goals like that - but sometimes it happens.  it would have been impossible to go through at 3-0 - but with the goal we have chances. everything is now possible.,wenger deject arsen slump arsen manag arsen wenger claim display defeat bayern munich bad peform champion leagu kolo tour late goal give gunner hope second leg wenger say posit still tie player realli dressingroom feel realli turn bad perform face real struggl least give u chanc goalscor tour also fault two goal wenger say need help tour rebuild confid low moment wenger also tri stay upbeat ad enough time cri could cri mayb would easy life goe job good bad night bad night still confid qualiti player well spirit desir wenger bayern counterpart felix magath mood celebr either say far happi despit win player fail tri score fourth kill tie conced late goal arsen fulli capabl score sever goal u turf arsen keeper jen lehmann whose person rivalri bayern goalkeep oliv kahn help result say blame third goal goalkeep alway blame know goal easi u time never conced three easi goal like sometim happen would imposs go goal chanc everyth possibl

915,147,clyde 0-5 celtic celtic brushed aside clyde to secure their place in the scottish cup semi-final  but only after a nervy and testing first half.  the home side s craig bryson had a goal chopped off before stan varga headed celtic into the lead. alan thompson scored from the penalty spot at the start of the second half after shaun maloney had been fouled. stilian petrov slid in a third  varga tapped in his second and craig bellamy completed the rout with a fine drive. bryn halliwell was the busier keeper early on  saving from bellamy  chris sutton and juninho. clyde had the ball in the net after half-an-hour through a tremendous strike from bryson  but the referee had already blown for a foul by petrov. from the resulting free kick  darren sheridan curled the ball round the celtic wall only for the post to deny him. back at the other end  halliwell did well to come off his line and block bellamy s effort to lift the ball over him. the keeper misjudged a corner that stephane henchoz headed wide  but a similar scenario five minutes before the break led to the opening goal. the ball was delivered from the left and halliwell was left floundering as varga glanced the ball into the net.  maloney replaced the injured sutton at half time and he marked his first competitive appearance after a year out injured by helping his side take a two-goal lead just after the break. the young striker fired a free kick straight into the clyde wall but as he collected the rebound  he was tripped by bryson and thompson converted the penalty. sheridan and bellamy were involved in something of a flare-up that led to both being booked after the intervention of the assistant referee. juninho brought out another good save from halliwell and then petrov saw a tremendous effort come off the top of the bar. but petrov and juninho combined brilliantly to allow the bulgarian to make it 3-0 on the hour mark - a quick one-two giving him the time and space to steer the ball past halliwell from 12 yards. varga got his second goal of the game as celtic drove home their advantage - thompson whipped in a corner from the right and the unmarked defender simply tapped the ball over the line from a couple of yards out. celtic were utterly dominant by this stage and bellamy opened his scoring account for the club after a fine move involving aiden mcgeady  jackie mcnamara and maloney culminated in the welshman hammering the ball into the net. halliwell kept the deficit at five by pushing a mcgeady shot wide as the game petered out.  halliwell  mensing  bollan  balmer  potter  sheridan (burns 61)  arbuckle (gilhaney 61)  gibson  bryson (jones 78)  malone  harty.  morrison  wilson.  mensing  sheridan.  douglas  henchoz  mcnamara  balde  varga  juninho paulista  thompson  lennon (lambert 70)  sutton (maloney 45)  petrov (mcgeady 70)  bellamy.  marshall  laursen.  thompson  bellamy.  : varga 40  thompson 48 pen  petrov 60  varga 68  bellamy 72.  8 200  c thomson,clyde celtic celtic brush asid clyde secur place scottish cup semifin nervi test first half home side craig bryson goal chop stan varga head celtic lead alan thompson score penalti spot start second half shaun maloney foul stilian petrov slid third varga tap second craig bellami complet rout fine drive bryn halliwel busier keeper earli save bellami chri sutton juninho clyde ball net halfanhour tremend strike bryson refere alreadi blown foul petrov result free kick darren sheridan curl ball round celtic wall post deni back end halliwel well come line block bellami effort lift ball keeper misjudg corner stephan henchoz head wide similar scenario five minut break lead open goal ball deliv left halliwel left flounder varga glanc ball net maloney replac injur sutton half time mark first competit appear year injur help side take twogoal lead break young striker fire free kick straight clyde wall collect rebound trip bryson thompson convert penalti sheridan bellami involv someth flareup lead book intervent assist refere juninho brought anoth good save halliwel petrov saw tremend effort come top bar petrov juninho combin brilliantli allow bulgarian make hour mark quick onetwo give time space steer ball past halliwel yard varga get second goal game celtic drove home advantag thompson whip corner right unmark defend simpli tap ball line coupl yard celtic utterli domin stage bellami open score account club fine move involv aiden mcgeadi jacki mcnamara maloney culmin welshman hammer ball net halliwel kept deficit five push mcgeadi shot wide game peter halliwel men bollan balmer potter sheridan burn arbuckl gilhaney gibson bryson jone malon harti morrison wilson men sheridan dougla henchoz mcnamara bald varga juninho paulista thompson lennon lambert sutton maloney petrov mcgeadi bellami marshal laursen thompson bellami varga thompson pen petrov varga bellami c thomson
916,614,student  fee factor  played down a rise has been recorded in the number of students from south of the border applying to universities in scotland.  however  lifelong learning minister jim wallace said that this would not result in scottish students missing out. applications from england and wales rose by 17% between january 2005 and the previous year  up 23 600 to 27 700. fears had been expressed that a flood of  fee refugees  would try to avoid top-up fees of up to £3 000 a year being introduced in england. in june last year  mr wallace announced proposals to increase tuition fees for english students studying in scotland by £2 000 in an attempt to prevent a cross-border flood  although no figure has yet been agreed. legislation to introduce the top-up fees in england is not due to take effect until autumn 2006 and students who start before then will not have to pay additional fees at all.  the figures were made public on thursday by admissions service ucas. universities scotland  which represents university principals  claimed that an increase in applications did not amount to scottish students being squeezed out. director  david caldwell  said some students could be applying in an attempt to avoid the possible increase in annual fees at english universities  but this was not a major factor. he told bbc radio scotland s good morning scotland programme:  the reason people are opting for scottish universities is that they are perceived as being of very high quality  they offer very attractive courses and scotland is seen as a very attractive place to study.   they know that when they take up their studies in 2006 they will be hit by top-up fees if they are going to a university in england and that may be part of the reason why the numbers coming to scotland are so inflated.  however  it does not mean that we will see thousands of additional students from england studying here.  mr wallace agreed and said the figures had to be looked at in context. he explained that when applications were translated into acceptances  the number was not huge - an additional figure of about 200.  also  the picture was further blurred by the fact that applications from wales  where there are no plans for top-up fees  have also risen  by 19%. mr wallace said:  accepting students from all parts of the world does show the high regard in which scottish higher education is held  not just in britain.  we want to make sure that when students are making their choice  they do so on the nature of the course and not because they are under some sort of financial pressure to go to scotland.  we do not want to have a situation where it becomes impossible for scottish students to get places at scottish universities because we are seen as the cheap option.  very often the quality of the university experience is enhanced by the fact there are students coming from a wide range of backgrounds so it would be wrong to go the other way and start excluding students.,student fee factor play rise record number student south border appli univers scotland howev lifelong learn minist jim wallac say would result scottish student miss applic england wale rise januari previou year fear express flood fee refuge would tri avoid topup fee £ year introduc england june last year mr wallac announc propos increas tuition fee english student studi scotland £ attempt prevent crossbord flood although figur yet agre legisl introduc topup fee england due take effect autumn student start pay addit fee figur make public thursday admiss servic uca univers scotland repres univers princip claim increas applic amount scottish student squeez director david caldwel say student could appli attempt avoid possibl increas annual fee english univers major factor told bbc radio scotland good morn scotland programm reason peopl opt scottish univers perceiv high qualiti offer attract cours scotland see attract place studi know take studi hit topup fee go univers england may part reason number come scotland inflat howev mean see thousand addit student england studi mr wallac agre say figur look context explain applic translat accept number huge addit figur also pictur blur fact applic wale plan topup fee also risen mr wallac say accept student part world show high regard scottish high educ held britain want make sure student make choic natur cours sort financi pressur go scotland want situat becom imposs scottish student get place scottish univers see cheap option often qualiti univers experi enhanc fact student come wide rang background would wrong go way start exclud student
917,1446,kennedy criticises  unfair  taxes gordon brown has failed to tackle the  fundamental unfairness  in the tax system in his ninth budget  charles kennedy has said.  how was it right that the poorest 20% of society were still paying more as a proportion of their income than the richest 20%  the lib dem leader asked. the new £200 council tax rebate for pensioners did nothing to fix the  unfair tax   he added. the government could not go on  patching up  the system  he added. speaking in the commons after mr brown had delivered what is widely thought to be the last budget before the general election  mr kennedy acknowledged that the uk was one of the most successful economies in the world.  but he criticised both the chancellor and the tories for failing to address the  ticking bomb  of council tax revaluation. he said the recent experience of wales indicated seven million households in england would pay significantly more after revaluation. the chancellor s announcement that he was to offer a £200 council tax rebate paid by pensioner households was merely a  sticking plaster  to a much bigger problem. the lib dem plan for a local income tax would benefit the typical household by more than £450 a year  with half of all pensioners paying no local tax and about three million being better off.  on pensions  mr kennedy said it was a  scandal  that the system discriminated against women who had missed making national insurance payments when they were having children. he said a residency criteria would end  at a stroke this fundamental iniquity . mr kennedy added his party s priorities of free long-term care for the elderly  abolishing top-up fees and replacing the council tax would be funded by charging 50% income tax to those earning more than £100 000 per annum. he contrasted his approach with mr brown s pledge in 2001 not to increase income tax. the chancellor went on to put up national insurance contributions after the election.  for most individuals  most families  most households  it adds up to exactly the same thing   said mr kennedy.  and they wonder why people get cynical about their politicians when they give one impression before an election and do exactly the opposite after that election.,kennedi criticis unfair tax gordon brown fail tackl fundament unfair tax system ninth budget charl kennedi say right poorest societi still pay proport incom richest lib dem leader ask new £ council tax rebat pension noth fix unfair tax ad govern could go patch system ad speak common mr brown deliv wide thought last budget gener elect mr kennedi acknowledg uk one success economi world criticis chancellor torus fail address tick bomb council tax revalu say recent experi wale indic seven million household england would pay significantli revalu chancellor announc offer £ council tax rebat paid pension household mere stick plaster much big problem lib dem plan local incom tax would benefit typic household £ year half pension pay local tax three million well pension mr kennedi say scandal system discrimin woman miss make nation insur payment child say resid criterion would end stroke fundament iniqu mr kennedi ad parti prioriti free longterm care elderli abolish topup fee replac council tax would fund charg incom tax earn £ per annum contrast approach mr brown pledg increas incom tax chancellor go put nation insur contribut elect individu famili household add exactli thing say mr kennedi wonder peopl get cynic politician give one impress elect exactli opposit elect

919,1630,wmc says xstrata bid is too low australian mining firm wmc resources has said it is worth up to 30% more than a hostile 7.4bn australian dollar ($5.8bn; £3bn) bid by rival xstrata.  there is now pressure on swiss-based xstrata to increase its takeover offer. a report from investment firm grant samuel in wmc defence documents values wmc shares at a$7.17 to a$8.24  against xstrata s bid of a$6.35 a share. analysts said the defence documents provided more details on wmc  and may trigger a possible rival bid.  if a bid is going to emerge it is probably likely in the next one to two weeks   said daiwa securities analyst mark pervan. he said the valuation would put increased pressure on xstrata to look at  sweetening  its offer. marc gonsalves  an executive at xstrata  said:  we will review the information contained in the target s statement over the next week or so.  he added:  while we will review the assumptions made by grant samuel in detail  we are extremely sceptical of their conclusion  and suggest that wmc shareholders take extreme care in presuming that these optimistic assumptions are capable of being realised.   last month australia s competition watchdog said it would not oppose the purchase of wmc by zurich and london-based xstrata. on tuesday  wmc chairman tommie bergman said in a statement the directors believed it was in shareholders  best interest to reject the offer. he said wmc would pursue  value-creating options  provided by a portfolio of  world class assets . and wmc chief executive andrew michelmore claimed the xstrata offer was aimed at creating value for xstrata s shareholders  and was not being made for the benefit of wmc s shareholders. grant samuel said its valuation of wmc was based on lower average prices for nickel  copper and uranium than current market levels.  any longer term commodity price improvements would only improve our outlook   mr michelmore said.  in 2003 xstrata acquired australia s largest copper miner - mim holdings. wmc resources is the world s third-largest producer of concentrated nickel  and also a miner of copper and uranium. it owns the olympic dam mine in south australia  which contains about one-third of the world s known uranium resources and is also the world s fourth largest copper mine. xstrata is a global mining giant with operations in australia  south africa  spain  germany  argentina and the uk. its core products are copper  coking coal  thermal coal  ferrochrome  vanadium and zinc. it also has growing businesses in gold  lead and silver.,wmc say xstrata bid low australian mine firm wmc resourc say worth hostil bn australian dollar bn £bn bid rival xstrata pressur swissbas xstrata increas takeov offer report invest firm grant samuel wmc defenc document valu wmc share a a xstrata bid a share analyst say defenc document provid detail wmc may trigger possibl rival bid bid go emerg probabl like next one two week say daiwa secur analyst mark pervan say valuat would put increas pressur xstrata look sweeten offer marc gonsalv execut xstrata say review inform contain target statement next week ad review assumpt make grant samuel detail extrem sceptic conclus suggest wmc sharehold take extrem care presum optimist assumpt capabl realis last month australia competit watchdog say would oppos purchas wmc zurich londonbas xstrata tuesday wmc chairman tommi bergman say statement director believ sharehold best interest reject offer say wmc would pursu valuecr option provid portfolio world class asset wmc chief execut andrew michelmor claim xstrata offer aim creat valu xstrata sharehold make benefit wmc sharehold grant samuel say valuat wmc base low averag price nickel copper uranium current market level longer term commod price improv would improv outlook mr michelmor say xstrata acquir australia large copper miner mim hold wmc resourc world thirdlargest produc concentr nickel also miner copper uranium own olymp dam mine south australia contain onethird world know uranium resourc also world fourth large copper mine xstrata global mine giant oper australia south africa spain germani argentina uk core product copper coke coal thermal coal ferrochrom vanadium zinc also grow busi gold lead silver

922,507,chelsea clinch cup in extra-time (after extra-time - score at 90 mins 1-1)  john arne riise volleyed liverpool ahead after 45 seconds but steven gerrard scored a 79th-minute own goal. blues boss jose mourinho was sent off for taunting liverpool fans after the goal and he watched on television as his side went on to win the game. drogba and kezman scored from close range before antonio nunez s header made for a tense finale. it was an amazing climax which gave mourinho his first silverware as chelsea manager. yet it was controversial too  after mourinho s sending off  apparently for putting his finger to his lips to hush the liverpool fans. there was no hushing them after the extraordinary opening in which the reds took a stunning lead inside the first minute.  riise could not have connected any better with morientes  cross as he smashed a left-foot volley past petr cech. the goal  the quickest-ever in a league cup final  stunned a blues side whose previously rock-solid confidence had been shaken by consecutive losses to newcastle and barcelona in the previous week. the blues  attacking chances were limited  and jerzy dudek was equal to frank lampard s powerfully-struck drive and drogba s low shot. despite their frustration  chelsea began to dominate midfield without seriously threatening to break liverpool s well-organised defence.  joe cole had a shot blocked and a promising damien duff break was halted by a good tackle from djimi traore  but the reds reached half-time without any major scares. the blues began the second half with more urgency and pegged liverpool back. nevertheless  liverpool were living dangerously and they needed a fantastic double save from dudek on 54 minutes  first at full stretch from gudjohnsen s header  then to smother william gallas  follow-up. and despite chelsea s possession  it was liverpool who fashioned the next clear opportunity as luis garcia fed dietmar hamann whose shot forced a superb save from cech. and the blues  increasingly adventurous approach saw liverpool earn another chance on the break on 75 minutes as paulo ferreira denied gerrard with a last-ditch tackle. but gerrard was on the scoresheet minutes later - in the most unfortunate fashion - as he inadvertently deflected ferrerira s free-kick past his own keeper and in off the post to bring chelsea level. that prompted mourinho s reaction which saw him sent off  but chelsea still pressed and duff had a chance to win the game with seven minutes remaining. dudek saved bravely at the irishman s feet  while milan baros shot wildly at the other end to ensure extra time. drogba almost headed chelsea in front two minutes into extra-time but the striker saw the ball rebound off the post. but seconds after the half-time interval  drogba made no mistake  picking the ball up from glen johnson s long throw inside the six-yard box and sidefooting home. and kezman appeared to have made the game safe as he netted from close range after gudjohnsen s cross in the 110th minute. there was still drama as nunez beat cech to a high ball with six minutes remaining to head his side level  but despite liverpool s desperate attacks  chelsea clung on to win.  dudek  finnan  carragher  hyypia  traore (biscan 67)  luis garcia  gerrard  hamann  riise  kewell (nunez 56)  morientes (baros 74).  subs not used: pellegrino  carson.  hyypia  traore  hamann  carragher.  riise 1  nunez 113.  cech  paulo ferreira  ricardo carvalho  terry  gallas (kezman 74)  jarosik (gudjohnsen 45)  lampard  makelele  cole (johnson 81)  drogba  duff.  subs not used: pidgeley  tiago.  lampard  kezman  drogba  duff.  gerrard 79 og  drogba 107  kezman 112.  78 000  s bennett (kent).,chelsea clinch cup extratim extratim score min john arn riis volley liverpool ahead second steven gerrard score thminut goal blue bos jose mourinho sent taunt liverpool fan goal watch televis side go win game drogba kezman score close rang antonio nunez header make ten final amaz climax give mourinho first silverwar chelsea manag yet controversi mourinho send appar put finger lip hush liverpool fan hush extraordinari open red take stun lead insid first minut riis could connect well morient cross smash leftfoot volley past petr cech goal quickestev leagu cup final stun blue side whose previous rocksolid confid shaken consecut loss newcastl barcelona previou week blue attack chanc limit jerzi dudek equal frank lampard powerfullystruck drive drogba low shot despit frustrat chelsea begin domin midfield without serious threaten break liverpool wellorganis defenc joe cole shot block promis damien duff break halt good tackl djimi traor red reach halftim without major scare blue begin second half urgenc peg liverpool back nevertheless liverpool live danger need fantast doubl save dudek minut first full stretch gudjohnsen header smother william galla followup despit chelsea posse liverpool fashion next clear opportun lui garcia fed dietmar hamann whose shot forc superb save cech blue increasingli adventur approach saw liverpool earn anoth chanc break minut paulo ferreira deni gerrard lastditch tackl gerrard scoresheet minut later unfortun fashion inadvert deflect ferrerira freekick past keeper post bring chelsea level prompt mourinho reaction saw sent chelsea still press duff chanc win game seven minut remain dudek save brave irishman foot milan baro shot wildli end ensur extra time drogba almost head chelsea front two minut extratim striker saw ball rebound post second halftim interv drogba make mistak pick ball glen johnson long throw insid sixyard box sidefoot home kezman appear make game safe net close rang gudjohnsen cross th minut still drama nunez beat cech high ball six minut remain head side level despit liverpool desper attack chelsea clung win dudek finnan carragh hyypia traor biscan lui garcia gerrard hamann riis kewel nunez morient baro sub use pellegrino carson hyypia traor hamann carragh riis nunez cech paulo ferreira ricardo carvalho terri galla kezman jarosik gudjohnsen lampard makelel cole johnson drogba duff sub use pidgeley tiago lampard kezman drogba duff gerrard og drogba kezman bennett kent

925,362,us woman sues over cartridges a us woman is suing hewlett packard (hp)  saying its printer ink cartridges are secretly programmed to expire on a certain date.  the unnamed woman from georgia says that a chip inside the cartridge tells the printer that it needs re-filling even when it does not. the lawsuit seeks to represent anyone in the us who has purchased an hp inkjet printer since february 2001. hp  the world s biggest printer firm  declined to comment on the lawsuit. hp ink cartridges use a chip technology to sense when they are low on ink and advise the user to make a change.  but the suit claims the chips also shut down the cartridges at a predetermined date regardless of whether they are empty.  the smart chip is dually engineered to prematurely register ink depletion and to render a cartridge unusable through the use of a built-in expiration date that is not revealed to the consumer   the suit said. the lawsuit is asking for restitution  damages and other compensation. the cost of printer cartridges has been a contentious issue in europe for the last 18 months. the price of inkjet printers has come down to as little as £34 but it could cost up to £1 700 in running costs over an 18-month period due to cartridge  a study by computeractive magazine revealed last year. the inkjet printer market has been the subject of an investigation by the uk s office of fair trading (oft)  which concluded in a 2002 report that retailers and manufacturers needed to make pricing more transparent for consumers.,u woman sue cartridg u woman su hewlett packard hp say printer ink cartridg secretli program expir certain date unnam woman georgia say chip insid cartridg tell printer need refil even lawsuit seek repres anyon u purchas hp inkjet printer sinc februari hp world big printer firm declin comment lawsuit hp ink cartridg use chip technolog sen low ink advis user make chang suit claim chip also shut cartridg predetermin date regardless whether empti smart chip dualli engin prematur regist ink deplet render cartridg unus use builtin expir date reveal consum suit say lawsuit ask restitut damag compens cost printer cartridg contenti issu europ last month price inkjet printer come littl £ could cost £ run cost month period due cartridg studi computeract magazin reveal last year inkjet printer market subject investig uk offic fair trade oft conclud report retail manufactur need make price transpar consum
926,154,german business confidence slides german business confidence fell in february knocking hopes of a speedy recovery in europe s largest economy.  munich-based research institute ifo said that its confidence index fell to 95.5 in february from 97.5 in january  its first decline in three months. the study found that the outlook in both the manufacturing and retail sectors had worsened. observers had been hoping that a more confident business sector would signal that economic activity was picking up.   we re surprised that the ifo index has taken such a knock   said dz bank economist bernd weidensteiner.  the main reason is probably that the domestic economy is still weak  particularly in the retail trade.  economy and labour minister wolfgang clement called the dip in february s ifo confidence figure  a very mild decline . he said that despite the retreat  the index remained at a relatively high level and that he expected  a modest economic upswing  to continue.  germany s economy grew 1.6% last year after shrinking in 2003. however  the economy contracted by 0.2% during the last three months of 2004  mainly due to the reluctance of consumers to spend. latest indications are that growth is still proving elusive and ifo president hans-werner sinn said any improvement in german domestic demand was sluggish. exports had kept things going during the first half of 2004  but demand for exports was then hit as the value of the euro hit record levels making german products less competitive overseas. on top of that  the unemployment rate has been stuck at close to 10% and manufacturing firms  including daimlerchrysler  siemens and volkswagen  have been negotiating with unions over cost cutting measures. analysts said that the ifo figures and germany s continuing problems may delay an interest rate rise by the european central bank. eurozone interest rates are at 2%  but comments from senior officials have recently focused on the threat of inflation  prompting fears that interest rates may rise.,german busi confid slide german busi confid fell februari knock hope speedi recoveri europ large economi munichbas research institut ifo say confid index fell februari januari first declin three month studi found outlook manufactur retail sector worsen observ hope confid busi sector would signal econom activ pick surpris ifo index take knock say dz bank economist bernd weidenstein main reason probabl domest economi still weak particularli retail trade economi labour minist wolfgang clement call dip februari ifo confid figur mild declin say despit retreat index remain rel high level expect modest econom upsw continu germani economi grow last year shrink howev economi contract last three month mainli due reluct consum spend late indic growth still prove elus ifo presid hanswern sinn say improv german domest demand sluggish export kept thing go first half demand export hit valu euro hit record level make german product less competit oversea top unemploy rate stuck close manufactur firm includ daimlerchrysl siemen volkswagen negoti union cost cut measur analyst say ifo figur germani continu problem may delay interest rate rise european central bank eurozon interest rate comment senior offici recent focus threat inflat prompt fear interest rate may rise
927,506,gallas sees two-horse race chelsea s william gallas believes they will battle it out with arsenal for the premiership in the coming months.   it ll be a two-horse race all the way to the end of the season because we are both going to give it everything   he told bbc sport.  you need to be good and you need a lot of luck. you need a bit of both but it will be as hard for the arsenal players as it is for the chelsea boys.   we know that we have got the power in our hands just now   added gallas.   but you never know what is going to happen in football - two seasons ago manchester united picked up so many points towards the end of the season when they won the title.  obviously  nobody at chelsea wants to come second but you never know what happens in football.  we will be challenging to come first as much as every arsenal player will be challenging to come first.  gallas has been given extra confidence by the impact manager jose mourinho has had since taking over as manager during the summer.  and the french international defender believes mourinho is perfectly suited to boss the squad of chelsea stars and says his managerial expertise will prevent any player revolt.  it s only normal when you have got a team put together of such big names that you put the finishing touch to it and the finishing touch at chelsea is a fantastic manager like mourinho   he said.  he is the icing on the cake at the club. he has this fantastic knack of thinking of everything.  another incredible quality that mourinho has is that every player  even though the fans may consider them to be a stars  within the dressing-room they are absolutely equal.  mourinho reminds everyone but he doesn t have to because he has created a wonderful atmosphere where everybody is playing and laughing every day.  it is a changed dressing-room from the atmosphere there was last year.,galla see twohors race chelsea william galla believ battl arsen premiership come month twohors race way end season go give everyth told bbc sport need good need lot luck need bit hard arsen player chelsea boy know get power hand ad galla never know go happen footbal two season ago manchest unit pick mani point toward end season titl obvious nobodi chelsea want come second never know happen footbal challeng come first much everi arsen player challeng come first galla give extra confid impact manag jose mourinho sinc take manag summer french intern defend believ mourinho perfectli suit bos squad chelsea star say manageri expertis prevent player revolt normal get team put togeth big name put finish touch finish touch chelsea fantast manag like mourinho say ice cake club fantast knack think everyth anoth incred qualiti mourinho everi player even though fan may consid star within dressingroom absolut equal mourinho remind everyon creat wonder atmospher everybodi play laugh everi day chang dressingroom atmospher last year
928,1938,howard denies split over id cards michael howard has denied his shadow cabinet was split over its decision to back controversial labour plans to introduce id cards.  the tory leader said his front bench team had reached a  collective view  after holding a  good discussion   but admitted it was  not an easy issue . he had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror  crime and illegal immigration. the lib dems have pledged to oppose the bill when it is debated next monday.  tory sources say senior party figures had argued vociferously against the id card scheme. among those reported to have serious reservations over the strategy were senior shadow cabinet members david davis  oliver letwin and tim yeo. but mr howard denied mr yeo  his transport and environment spokesman  said the plans  stink . he also said he was confident shadow home secretary mr davis would  set out the position very clearly  when he stands up to debate the matter next week. mr howard said the police had said id cards could  help them foil a terror bomb plot in which people could lose their lives . he added:  when the police say that you have to take them seriously .  he acknowledged there were  good libertarian arguments  against the cards  but said the shadow cabinet had weighed up all the  conflicting interests  before reaching its decision.  i don t pretend that it is an easy decision but at the end of the day a decision has to be taken.  he also denied he was afraid of looking  soft  on the issue  compared to labour. the conservatives announced their support for the government plans on monday evening.  sources within the party told the bbc mr howard had always been in favour of id cards  and tried to introduce them when he was home secretary. but the tories insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme.  they said they would also press labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the home office would be able to deliver them. and they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of id cards and whether people s privacy would be properly protected.  it is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect   a spokesman said. lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten has branded the id scheme a waste of money and  deeply flawed . he said:  this has all the signs of michael howard overruling colleagues  concerns over id cards.   the chairman of the bar council  guy mansfield qc warned there was a real risk that people on the  margins of society  would be driven into the hands of extremists.  what is going to happen to young asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere  they are going to be stopped. if they haven t [id cards] they are going to be detained.  tory ex-minister douglas hogg said he opposed the plans for id cards branding them a  regressive  step which would intrude into the lives of ordinary citizens without any counterbalancing benefits. he predicted ultimately carrying the cards would become compulsory and that would lead to large numbers of britain s ethnic minorities being stopped by police.,howard deni

929,159,uk firms  embracing e-commerce  uk firms are embracing internet trading opportunities as never before  e-commerce minister mike o brien says.  a government-commissioned study ranked the uk third in its world index of use of information and communication technology (ict). the report suggests 69% of uk firms are now using broadband and that 30% of micro businesses are trading online. mr o brien said uk businesses were sprinting forward in ict use  but that there were more challenges ahead. the report  carried out independently by consultants booz allen hamilton and hi europe  placed the uk third behind sweden and ireland for business use of ict.  it showed british business brought greater maturity to their ict use  by using broadband in increased numbers  bringing ict into their business plans and using new technologies such as voice activated programmes and desktop video conferences. mr o brien said:  the increase in the proportion of business connected by broadband shows that uk companies are embracing the opportunities that ict can bring.  it is particularly encouraging to see that small businesses are beginning to narrow the digital divide that appeared to have opened up in recent years.  the government would play its part in  cultivating an environment where information and communication technologies can flourish   mr o brien said. the  clear message  the report sends is that effective use of ict can bring real improvements in business performance for all business.   however  we are not at the finishing line yet and many challenges remain if the uk is to reach its aim of becoming a world-leading e-economy   he added. the international benchmarking study was based on 8 000 telephone interviews with businesses  of which more than 2 700 were uk businesses. it is the eighth in a series of examining the adoption and deployment of ict in the world s most industrialised nations.,uk firm embrac ecommerc uk firm embrac internet trade opportun never ecommerc minist mike brien say governmentcommiss studi rank uk third world index use inform commun technolog ict report suggest uk firm use broadband micro busi trade onlin mr brien say uk busi sprint forward ict use challeng ahead report carri independ consult booz allen hamilton hi europ place uk third behind sweden ireland busi use ict show british busi brought great matur ict use use broadband increas number bring ict busi plan use new technolog voic activ programm desktop video confer mr brien say increas proport busi connect broadband show uk compani embrac opportun ict bring particularli encourag see small busi begin narrow digit divid appear open recent year govern would play part cultiv environ inform commun technolog flourish mr brien say clear messag report send effect use ict bring real improv busi perform busi howev finish line yet mani challeng remain uk reach aim becom worldlead eeconomi ad intern benchmark studi base telephon interview busi uk busi eighth seri examin adopt deploy ict world industrialis nation
930,156,the comic book genius of stan lee stan lee  the man responsible for a string of comic superheroes that have become household names  has won a court battle for a slice of the profits from the hit spider-man movies.  many marvel at the man who gave his characters extraordinary powers and everyday headaches - a formula which revolutionised comics. born in 1922 to poor working-class jewish immigrants from romania  stan lieberman  got a job in timely publications  a company owned by a relative. he was assigned to the comics division and - thanks to a fertile imagination - rose to editor by the age of 18. for more than 20 years  he was  the ultimate hack  - knocking out crime stories  horrors  westerns  anything to sate the appetite of his juvenile readership. words of more than two syllables were discouraged. characters were either all good or bad  with no shades of grey. so embarrassed was lieberman by much of what he was writing that he refused to put his real name on the byline. he assumed the  dumb name   stan lee  now legally adopted.  by the time he was 40  lee had decided he was too old for the comic game. his british-born wife  joan  suggested he had nothing to lose and  for his swansong  should write the kind of characters he really wanted to create. after a rival comic had come up with a superteam consisting of batman  superman and wonder woman  timely needed to respond.  lee s answer  in 1961  was the fantastic four - a team of astronauts who gained super powers after being bombarded with cosmic rays. they were to change lee s life  and the comics industry  forever. lee gave each character individual  everyday teenage problems such as dandruff  ingrown toenails and acne. they would frequently fall out with their parents and each other. the fan letters poured in. without immediately knowing it  stan lee had ushered in the golden age of comics  and his imagination was rekindled. his marvel universe spawned the new title of marvel comics. soon after  nerdy peter parker was transformed - after a bite from an irradiated spider - into someone who could crawl up the sides of new york s skyscrapers. spider-man was born. he was to become an icon of modern popular culture. spidey  as he is affectionately known  had quite extraordinary powers - yet he had problems at work  at home and with his girlfriends. at last  the teenager was no longer just the sidekick  but the main hero. and the hero was no longer just brawn  he had brains too.   just because he s a hero and has super powers doesn t mean he doesn t have problems   stan lee told the bbc. the incredible hulk  the mighty thor  iron man and the rest all grappled with problems like drug abuse  bigotry and social inequality. radically  lee gave the artists responsible for the comic designs credits for their work. jack kirby  frank miller  john romitaand and others achieved cult status in their own right. other superheroes broke new ground in other ways. daredevil was blind  black panther was black and silver surfer pondered the state of humanity. lee s influence remains. some years ago the marvel hero  northstar  came out of the closet. in its heyday  marvel was selling 50 million copies a year. until he retired from editing in 1971  stan lee wrote all the copy for marvel s covers.  in 1999  his stan lee media venture  aimed at marrying comic-strips with the internet  went spectacularly wrong. lee went bankrupt and his business partner landed in prison for fraud. in 2001 though  he started a new company entitled pow! (purveyors of wonder) entertainment  which is currently developing films and television programmes. his latest project is a superhero based on a real person - jay j armes  who has metal claws after losing both hands aged 12 and fights crime with a tiger. but his 40-year-old creations are still as enduring as ever - with x-men  the hulk and daredevil have all been turned into hollywood action movies in the last five years. but spider-man has been the biggest box office hit  with the 2002 original and its 2004 sequel taking almost $1.6bn (£857m) in ticket sales around the world - before dvd and merchandise sales are counted. it seems stan lee is as indestructible as his heroes.,comic book geniu stan lee stan lee man respons string comic superhero becom household name court battl slice profit hit spiderman movi mani marvel man give charact extraordinari power everyday headach formula revolutionis comic born poor workingclass jewish immigr romania stan lieberman get job time public compani own rel assign comic divis thank fertil imagin rise editor age year ultim hack knock crime stori horror western anyth sate appetit juvenil readership word two syllabl discourag charact either good bad shade grey embarrass lieberman much write refus put real name bylin assum dumb name stan lee legal adopt time lee decid old comic game britishborn wife joan suggest noth lose swansong write kind charact realli want creat rival comic come superteam consist batman superman wonder woman time need respond lee answer fantast four team astronaut gain super power bombard cosmic ray chang lee life comic industri forev lee give charact individu everyday teenag problem dandruff ingrown toenail acn would frequent fall parent fan letter pour without immedi know stan lee usher golden age comic imagin rekindl marvel univers spawn new titl marvel comic soon nerdi peter parker transform bite irradi spider someon could crawl side new york skyscrap spiderman born becom icon modern popular cultur spidey affection know quit extraordinari power yet problem work home girlfriend last teenag longer sidekick main hero hero longer brawn brain hero super power mean problem stan lee told bbc incred hulk mighti thor iron man rest grappl problem like drug abus bigotri social inequ radic lee give artist respons comic design credit work jack kirbi frank miller john romitaand other achiev cult statu right superhero broke new ground way daredevil blind black panther black silver surfer ponder state human lee influenc remain year ago marvel hero northstar come closet heyday marvel sell million copi year retir edit stan lee write copi marvel cover stan lee medium ventur aim marri comicstrip internet go spectacularli wrong lee go bankrupt busi partner land prison fraud though start new compani entitl pow purveyor wonder entertain current develop film televis programm late project superhero base real person jay j arm metal claw lose hand age fight crime tiger yearold creation still endur ever xmen hulk daredevil turn hollywood action movi last five year spiderman big box offic hit origin sequel take almost bn £m ticket sale around world dvd merchandis sale count seem stan lee indestruct hero
931,912,warning over tsunami aid website net users are being told to avoid a scam website that claims to collect cash on behalf of tsunami victims.  the site looks plausible because it uses an old version of the official disasters emergency committee webpage. however  dec has no connection with the fake site and says it has contacted the police about it. the site is just the latest in a long list of scams that try to cash in on the goodwill generated by the tsunami disaster.  the link to the website is contained in a spam e-mail that is currently circulating. the message s subject line reads  urgent tsunami earthquake appeal  and its text bears all the poor grammar and bad spelling that characterises many other phishing attempts. the web address of the fake site is decuk.org which could be close enough to the official www.dec.org.uk address to confuse some people keen to donate. patricia sanders  spokeswoman for the disaster emergency committee said it was aware of the site and had contacted the computer crime unit at scotland yard to help get it shut down. she said the spam e-mails directing people to the site started circulating two days ago shortly after the domain name of the site was registered. it is thought that the fake site is being run from romania. ms sanders said dec had contacted us net registrars who handle domain ownership and the net hosting firm that is keeping the site on the web.  dec was going to push for all cash donated via the site to be handed over to the official organisation. bt and dec s hosting company were also making efforts to get the site shut down  she said.  ms sanders said sending out spam e-mail to solicit donations was not dec s style and that it would never canvass support in this way. she said that dec hoped to get the fake site shut down as soon as possible. all attempts by the bbc news website to contact the people behind the site have failed. none of the e-mail addresses supplied on the site work and the real owner of the domain is obscured in publicly available net records. this is not the first attempt to cash in on the outpouring of goodwill that has accompanied appeals for tsunami aid. one e-mail sent out in early january came from someone who claimed that he had lost his parents in the disaster and was asking for help moving an inheritance from a bank account in the netherlands. the con was very similar to the familiar nigerian forward fee fraud e-mails that milk money out of people by promising them a cut of a much larger cash pile. other scam e-mails included a link to a website that supposedly let people donate money but instead loaded spyware on their computers that grabbed confidential information. in a monthly report anti-virus firm sophos said that two e-mail messages about the tsunami made it to the top 10 hoax list during january. another tsunami-related e-mail is also circulating that carries the zar worm which tries to spread via the familiar route of microsoft s outlook e-mail program. anyone opening the attachment of the mail will have their contact list plundered by the worm keen to find new addresses to send itself to.,warn tsunami aid websit net user told avoid scam

936,2014,trade gap narrows as exports rise the uk s trade gap narrowed in november  helped by a 7.5% rise in exports outside the european union.  according to the office for national statistics  the difference between what the uk exported and imported was £3.1bn ($5.8bn)  down from october s £3.6bn. overall uk exports - including both goods and services - rose by more than 3.2% to £24.8bn  although total imports rose again to a new record of £27.9bn. the deficit for goods alone was £4.6bn  down from october s £5bn. during november the uk exported £16.9bn worth of goods  but imported £21.5bn. the cumulative deficit for the first eleven months of 2004 now stands at £36.3bn  £4.5bn higher than the same period in 2003.  november saw an improvement in export levels to both the european union and the rest of the world  the office for national statistics (ons) said. eu exports rose 2%  fuelled by an increase in sales of chemicals. non-eu exports shot up 7.5%  with growth seen across a range of manufacturing sectors including cars  consumer durables and chemicals. the export boost offset a 1% rise in imports. non-eu imports rose 3%  but the growth in goods entering the uk from the eu slowed to 0.5%.  the uk s deficit with the eu fell to £1.9bn from £2.1bn  while its non-eu shortfall dropped to £2.7bn from £2.9bn in october.  the country s surplus on trade-in-services remained steady at £1.5bn for the fifth month in a row. paul dales  uk economist for capital economics  said the figures represented an improvement on recent months. however  he stressed that the long-term prognosis for exports was still uncertain.  the figures are a lot better than expected but the trend still remains poor   he said.  there have been some very encouraging signs that the uk export recovery is starting to take hold. but there is a danger that this could be held back by the ongoing weakness of domestic demand on the continent.,trade gap narrow export rise uk trade gap narrow novemb help rise export outsid european union accord offic nation statist differ uk export import £bn bn octob £bn overal uk export includ good servic rise £bn although total import rise new record £bn deficit good alon £bn octob £bn novemb uk export £bn worth good import £bn cumul deficit first eleven month stand £bn £bn high period novemb saw improv export level european union rest world offic nation statist on say eu export rise fuell increas sale chemic noneu export shot growth see across rang manufactur sector includ car consum durabl chemic export boost offset rise import noneu import rise growth good enter uk eu slow uk deficit eu fell £bn £bn noneu shortfal drop £bn £bn octob countri surplu tradeinservic remain steadi £bn fifth month row paul dale uk economist capit econom say figur repres improv recent month howev stress longterm prognosi export still uncertain figur lot well expect trend still remain poor say encourag sign uk export recoveri start take hold danger could held back ongo weak domest demand contin
937,310,iraq advice claim sparks new row the tories say ministers must respond in parliament to claims that the legal advice used to justify the iraq war was drawn up at number 10.  downing street has denied the claims  made in a new book about the attorney general lord goldsmith s advice. lord goldsmith also denied them  saying he was not  leaned on  in any way. but the conservatives and liberal democrats say they want the publication of the full legal advice given by the attorney general.  the government has consistently refused to publish lord goldsmith s advice on the legality of the war - saying such papers have always been kept confidential.  but a short statement about lord goldsmith s position was presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 march 2003 - just before a crucial commons vote on the military action. it said it was  plain  iraq continued to be in material breach of un resolution 1441. in his new book  lawless world  philippe sands  a qc and international law professor  suggests the parliamentary answer was written in downing street. according to mr sands  lord goldsmith had warned tony blair in a document on 7 march 2003 that the use of force against iraq could be illegal and that it would have been safer to seek a second un resolution sanctioning military action.  mr sands told newsnight the government had prepared a legal team to be able to defend its case  in case legal action was taken against the uk over the war. on 10 march  military chiefs reportedly asked for an unequivocal statement about the legality of the war to make sure troops could be defended in a court of law. the book  being serialised in the guardian newspaper  says on 13 march lord goldsmith met then home office minister lord falconer and downing street adviser baroness morgan.  after that downing street proceeded to set out his [lord goldsmith s] view in a parliamentary answer which was then published on 17 march   said mr sands.  tory leader michael howard reiterated calls for the publication of the full legal advice given by the attorney general  warning:  this issue will not go away.   these revelations throw an intensive spotlight on to the cavalier way in which this government operates - even on an issue as important as peace and war.  the government needs to act to restore public confidence and trust.  liberal democrat foreign affairs spokesman menzies campbell repeated his party s calls for lord goldsmith s first piece of legal advice to be made public.  the public interest  which the government claims justifies non-publication of the whole of the advice  can only be served now by the fullest disclosure.   in a statement to newsnight  lord goldsmith said:  in my parliamentary answer on march 17 2003  i explained my genuinely held independent view  that military action was lawful under the existing security council resolutions.  it was certainly not a view that i expressed as a result of being leaned on in any way  nor as i have already made clear  was it written by or at number 10.  the prime minister s official spokesman also rejected the claims  saying:  the attorney general made it clear the words and the judgement were his.  but ex-foreign secretary robin cook says all the advice should now be published. he said the claims suggested parliament had only received a pr&#233;cis of lord goldsmith s second opinion - and that it was actually drafted in no 10. this would be wrong even if lord goldsmith had signed the statement  mr cook said  because the attorney general s advice should be an  independent legal opinion   not subject to  political negotiation of this kind .,iraq advic claim spark new row torus say minist must respond parliament claim legal advic use justifi iraq war drawn number down street deni claim make new book attorney gener lord goldsmith advic lord goldsmith also deni say lean way conserv liber democrat say want public full legal advic give attorney gener govern consist refus publish lord goldsmith advic legal war say paper alway kept confidenti short statement lord goldsmith posit present write parliamentari answer march crucial common vote militari action say plain iraq continu materi breach un resolut new book lawless world philipp sand qc intern law professor suggest parliamentari answer write down street accord mr sand lord goldsmith warn toni blair document march use forc iraq could illeg would safer seek second un resolut sanction militari action mr sand told newsnight govern prepar legal team abl defend case case legal action take uk war march militari chief reportedli ask unequivoc statement legal war make sure troop could defend court law book serialis guardian newspap say march lord goldsmith met home offic minist lord falcon down street advis baro morgan down street proceed set lord goldsmith view parliamentari answer publish march say mr sand torus leader michael howard reiter call public full legal advic give attorney gener warn issu go away revel throw intens spotlight cavali way govern oper even issu import peac war govern need act restor public confid trust liber democrat foreign affair spokesman menzi campbel repeat parti call lord goldsmith first piec legal advic make public public interest govern claim justifi nonpubl whole advic serv full disclosur statement newsnight lord goldsmith say parliamentari answer march explain genuin held independ view militari action law exist secur council resolut certainli view express result lean way alreadi make clear write number prime minist offici spokesman also reject claim say attorney gener make clear word judgement exforeign secretari robin cook say advic publish say claim suggest parliament receiv prci lord goldsmith second opinion actual draft would wrong even lord goldsmith sign statement mr cook say attorney gener advic independ legal opinion subject polit negoti kind
938,1042,aviator  creator  in oscars snub the man who said he got oscar-nominated movie the aviator off the ground and signed up leonardo dicaprio has been shut out of the academy awards race.  charles evans jr battled over his role with the people who eventually made the film  and won a producer s credit. but he is not on the list of producers who can win a best film oscar due to a limit on the number of nominees. the oscars organisers have picked two of the aviator s four producers to be nominated for best film.  up to three producers can be named per film but the studios behind the aviator and million dollar baby failed to trim their credits - so the academy of motion pictures arts and sciences (ampas) has done it for them. the aviator s nominated producers are michael mann and graham king - with mr evans and sandy climan  mr mann s former deputy  left off. mr evans sued mr mann in 2001  claiming he came up with the idea  spent years developing it and persuaded dicaprio to play hughes - but said he was later excluded from the project. the two sides settled out of court in a deal that has remained secret apart from the fact mr evans  name has appeared as a producer when the film s credits roll. at the golden globes  mr evans - who was named among the winners when the film won best drama film - evaded a security guard to have his photo taken with dicaprio  director martin scorsese  mr mann and mr king.  ampas decided to limit the number of producers who could be nominated after shakespeare in love s victory in 1999 saw five producers collect awards. the eligible names for the aviator and million dollar baby were decided by ampas  producers branch executive committee on wednesday. the decision also saw clint eastwood get his third personal nomination for million dollar baby. he is now named in the best film category as well as being nominated for best director and best lead actor. the academy awards ceremony will be held in hollywood on 27 february. chinese actress ziyi zhang  star of crouching tiger  hidden dragon  hero and house of flying daggers  is the latest name to be added to the list of presenters on the night.,aviat creator oscar snub man say get oscarnomin movi aviat ground sign leonardo dicaprio shut academi award race charl evan jr battl role peopl eventu make film produc credit list produc win best film oscar due limit number nomine oscar organis pick two aviat four produc nomin best film three produc name per film studio behind aviat million dollar babi fail trim credit academi motion pictur art scienc ampa do aviat nomin produc michael mann graham king mr evan sandi climan mr mann former deputi left mr evan su mr mann claim come idea spent year develop persuad dicaprio play hugh say later exclud project two side settl court deal remain secret apart fact mr evan name appear produc film credit roll golden globe mr evan name among winner film best drama film evad secur guard photo take dicaprio director martin scorses mr mann mr king ampa decid limit number produc could nomin shakespear love victori saw five produc collect award elig name aviat million dollar babi decid ampa produc branch execut committe wednesday decis also saw clint eastwood get third person nomin million dollar babi name best film categori well nomin best director best lead actor academi award ceremoni held hollywood februari chine actress ziyi zhang star crouch tiger hidden dragon hero hous fli dagger late name ad list present night
939,1516,booming markets shed few tears the market  former british government minister michael heseltine once said  has no morality.  and indeed  stock exchange traders around asia have wasted little time regretting the victims of this week s disaster. stock markets in indonesia and india have hit all-time highs this week; even in sri lanka  more comprehensively affected  the main index has lost only 5% since the waves hit. bigger markets further afield have barely twitched. the msci world share index  a measure of global stock market performance  hit its highest level this week since early 2001; the bbc global 30 has risen by 3% in the past week. and this at a time when - all sentiment aside - insurance costs are already estimated in the tens of billions of dollars  and countries around the region are looking at trimming their growth forecasts.  in fact  the markets are being perfectly rational.  for a start  the notional insurance cost of the disaster will have little bearing on corporate bottom lines. the overwhelming majority of the victims will have had no insurance: according to estimates from india  only one-quarter of those affected there were wealthy enough to afford insurance  and only one-quarter of that group at most will have taken out policies. indonesia is likely to have even lower take-up rates. and where insurance certainly is in place - in  for example  the many tourist complexes affected - the costs will be borne in far-away corners of the global reinsurance market  rather than landing locally.  second  stock markets do not trade the sort of companies likely to have been damaged. most of the biggest companies traded on the soaring jakarta stock exchange are in oil  technology and financial services - none of which have been hit by the flooding. tourist businesses  the most likely sufferers  are either foreign-owned or too small to have their shares listed. those that are listed have suffered: confifi hotel holdings  a small sri lankan tourism firm  has halved in value this week. but there are winners as well as losers. asian stock markets are heavily inclined towards property and construction companies  many of which will be rubbing their hands over the reconstruction opportunities. in indonesia  shares in state construction companies adhi karya and semen gresik have jumped sharply this week.  more broadly  the academic consensus is that major disasters are largely neutral in their longer-term economic impact.  according to the natural hazards research and applications information center at colorado state university  there is little evidence that disasters are inevitably followed by a depression. the need to find money to replace lost and damaged property is balanced by the beneficial effect of reconstruction activity; there is rarely  the centre says  any sort of rebuilding boom  but in most cases sizeable indirect losses are avoided. a study of the 1993 des moines floods  from the disaster research center at the university of delaware*  found that 70% of local businesses were no worse off after the disaster  and another 18% felt themselves better off.  although it is commonly assumed on the basis of anecdotal evidence that disasters result in business failures and bankruptcies on a large scale  our research indicates that most businesses  even those that are especially hard-hit  do indeed recover   the authors concluded.  but disasters have a vast psychological impact  and markets are driven by psychological factors.  in particular  many analysts warn of panic spreading unchecked through the global financial system  as investors seek to cover themselves against the unforeseeable effects of unguessable events. in fact  again  the risks here are lower than they seem. even the costliest natural disaster is rendered minuscule by the global capital market - currently $30 trillion and rising. a series of recent shocks  the colorado centre has argued  have demonstrated that this seamless global contagion hardly ever happens: market tremors rarely translate into economic slumps  and economic woes rarely seriously undermine markets. the trillion-dollar debts of japan s banks  for example  have had no effect on stock markets further afield than tokyo. and the us stock market was on its way down long before 11 september  2001; it rose by 20% during the six months following the attacks.  it is not that the broking community is indifferent to disasters or feelings   one bombay trader said this week.  but the reaction would have been seen if business had been affected. business sense probably tends to overrule everything else.,boom market shed tear market former british govern minist michael heseltin say moral inde stock exchang trader around asia wast littl time regret victim week disast stock market indonesia india hit alltim high week even sri lanka comprehens affect main index lose sinc wave hit big market afield bare twitch msci world share index measur global stock market perform hit high level week sinc earli bbc global risen past week time sentiment asid insur cost alreadi estim ten billion dollar countri around region look trim growth forecast fact market perfectli ration start notion insur cost disast littl bear corpor bottom line overwhelm major victim insur accord estim india onequart affect wealthi enough afford insur onequart group take polici indonesia like even low takeup rate insur certainli place exampl mani tourist complex affect cost born faraway corner global reinsur market rather land local second stock market trade sort compani like damag big compani trade soar jakarta stock exchang oil technolog financi servic none hit flood tourist busi like suffer either foreignown small share list list suffer confifi hotel hold small sri lankan tourism firm halv valu week winner well loser asian stock market heavili inclin toward properti construct compani mani rub hand reconstruct opportun indonesia share state construct compani adhi karya semen gresik jump sharpli week broadli academ consensu major disast larg neutral longerterm econom impact accord natur hazard research applic inform center colorado state univers littl evid disast inevit follow depress need find money replac lose damag properti balanc benefici effect reconstruct activ rare centr say sort rebuild boom case sizeabl indirect loss avoid studi de moin flood disast research center univers delawar found local busi wors disast anoth felt well although commonli assum basi anecdot evid disast result busi failur bankruptci larg scale research indic busi even especi hardhit inde recov author conclud disast vast psycholog impact market driven psycholog factor particular mani analyst warn panic spread uncheck global financi system investor seek cover unforese effect unguess event fact risk low seem even costliest natur disast render minuscul global capit market current trillion rise seri recent shock colorado centr argu demonstr seamless global contagion hardli ever happen market tremor rare translat econom slump econom woe rare serious undermin market trilliondollar debt japan bank exampl effect stock market afield tokyo u stock market way long septemb rise six month follow attack broke commun indiffer disast feel one bombay trader say week reaction would see busi affect busi sen probabl tend overrul everyth el
940,2060,blair and brown criticised by mps labour mps have angrily criticised tony blair and gordon brown amid renewed reports of a rift between the two men.  a meeting of the parliamentary labour party saw a succession of normally loyal members warn that feuding could jeopardise labour s election hopes. the pm insisted nothing would derail labour s campaign  despite a new book saying he has upset his chancellor by backing out of a pledge to stand aside. mr brown will again be in the public eye at the party s new poster launch. in what the party had hoped would be perceived as a show of unity  he is due to line up alongside alan milburn - the man controversially appointed as the party s election supremo - and deputy leader john prescott for the event in london on tuesday. relations between mr brown and mr milburn are widely reported to be cool ever since mr blair brought the latter back into the cabinet to run labour s election campaign  a role successfully carried out by mr brown in both 1997 and 2001.  mr blair told the parliamentary labour party on monday:  i know from everyone here  in cabinet and government  nothing is going to get in the way of a unified labour party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need.   the prime minister and his chancellor arrived within seconds of each other for the meeting of the plp and were seemingly in good spirits as it started. new speculation about the state of their relationship was sparked by claims in brown s britain  by sunday telegraph journalist robert peston  which suggested mr blair went back on a pledge to make way for mr brown. labour s paul flynn said mr blair and mr brown had a  scorching  from mps adding:  it was a parliamentary labour party meeting like no other.   backbencher stephen pound said some mps had threatend to expose those fuelling the reports if mr blair and mr brown did not  stop this nonsense  this poisonous briefing . lord campbell-savours  a former mp  challenged mr brown to deny reports that he had told the prime minister he did not believe anything he said. mr prescott said mps were entitled to complain about discipline after reading recent press reports.   they told us very clearly  it was the troops telling the leaders: get in line   he told bbc radio 4 s today on tuesday. mr prescott said there were occasional disagreements in any government. but he argued mr blair and mr brown could work successfully together and had produced a strong economy and better public services.  the new book claims mr prescott hosted a dinner in november 2003 where the prime minister told mr brown he would stand down before the next election because he had lost trust over the iraq war. he had then changed his mind in june 2004  following intervention from cabinet allies and suspicion that the chancellor was manoeuvring against him  writes mr peston. mr prescott said there was a dinner but the discussions were confidential.  of course as a waiter for 10 years i have a professional ability here   he joked. mr blair has insisted he has done no deals over the premiership while mr brown says he will not let  gossip  distract him from helping a unified election campaign. the conservatives say the two men are behaving like squabbling schoolboys and the liberal democrats claim personal ambition is obstructing good government.,blair brown criticis mp labour mp angrili criticis toni blair gordon brown amid renew report rift two men meet parliamentari labour parti saw success normal loyal member warn feud could jeopardis labour elect hope pm insist noth would derail labour campaign despit new book say upset chancellor back pledg stand asid mr brown public eye parti new poster launch parti hope would perceiv show uniti due line alongsid alan milburn man controversi appoint parti elect supremo deputi leader john prescott event london tuesday relat mr brown mr milburn wide report cool ever sinc mr blair brought latter back cabinet run labour elect campaign role success carri mr brown mr blair told parliamentari labour parti monday know everyon cabinet govern noth go get way unifi labour parti unifi posit win third term peopl desper need prime minist chancellor arriv within second meet plp seemingli good spirit start new specul state relationship spark claim brown britain sunday telegraph journalist robert peston suggest mr blair go back pledg make way mr brown labour paul flynn say mr blair mr brown scorch mp ad parliamentari labour parti meet like backbench stephen pound say mp threatend expo fuell report mr blair mr brown stop nonsens poison brief lord campbellsavour former mp challeng mr brown deni report told prime minist believ anyth say mr prescott say mp entitl complain disciplin read recent press report told u clearli troop tell leader get line told bbc radio today tuesday mr prescott say occasion disagr govern argu mr blair mr brown could work success togeth produc strong economi well public servic new book claim mr prescott host dinner novemb prime minist told mr brown would stand next elect lose trust iraq war chang mind june follow intervent cabinet alli suspicion chancellor manoeuvr write mr peston mr prescott say dinner discus confidenti cours waiter year profession abil joke mr blair insist do deal premiership mr brown say let gossip distract help unifi elect campaign conserv say two men behav like squabbl schoolboy liber democrat claim person ambit obstruct good govern

944,416,wmc profits up amid bid criticism australian mining firm wmc resources has seen a fivefold rise in profits while continuing to be the target of a hostile takeover bid.  wmc said it made net profits of 1.33bn australian dollars ($1bn; £550m) in 2004  up from a$246bn the year before. it is currently arguing against an offer from swiss xstrata  which the firm raised to a$8.4bn last week after wmc said it was an undervaluation. now reports say that the australian government is against the deal.  trade minister mark vaile has said that the bid may be  against the national interest . mr vaile  who was quoted in the australian financial review  compared xstrata s attempt to take over wmc to a similar bid by oil giant shell for australia s woodside petroleum in 2001. the bid was thrown out by treasurer peter costello on national interest grounds. wmc s interests in uranium deposits were a contributing factor  mr vaile said. wmc itself  however  has no objection in principle to being bought out  having spun off its aluminium operations in 2002 to make itself a more tempting target - as long as the price is right. its stellar performance in 2004 has been built on sky-high prices for metals. copper and nickel in particular have been in high demand thanks to china s booming economy  which expanded more than 9% in each of the past two years. nickel prices rose 43% during the year  with copper up 36%.,wmc profit amid bid critic australian mine firm wmc resourc see fivefold rise profit continu target hostil takeov bid wmc say make net profit bn australian dollar bn £m abn year current argu offer swiss xstrata firm rais abn last week wmc say undervalu report say australian govern deal trade minist mark vail say bid may nation interest mr vail quot australian financi review compar xstrata attempt take wmc similar bid oil giant shell australia woodsid petroleum bid thrown treasur peter costello nation interest ground wmc interest uranium deposit contribut factor mr vail say wmc howev object principl bought spun aluminium oper make tempt target long price right stellar perform built skyhigh price metal copper nickel particular high demand thank china boom economi expand past two year nickel price rise year copper

948,1943,yukos accused of lying to court russian oil firm yukos lied to a us court in an attempt to stop the russian government selling off its key production unit  the court has heard.  the unit  yugansk  was sold to pay off a $27.5bn (£14.5bn) back tax bill. yukos argued that since it had a us subsidiary and local bank accounts  the us court could declare it bankrupt and stop the auction of yugansk. but deutsche bank - itself a target of a yukos lawsuit - said documents had been backdated to strengthen the case.  deutsche bank s evidence came on the first day of a two-day hearing in houston. its lawyer  hugh ray  told the court that yukos had claimed it had transferred $27m into two texas bank accounts opened by its new us subsidiary. by doing so  he said  the firm had intended to reinforce its us presence - and thus its chances of getting its case heard in us courts. but he said that the papers documenting the transaction were not drawn up till weeks after yukos made its bankruptcy application on 14 december  and then backdated.  yukos chief financial officer bruce misamore  who had moved to the us in early december to set up yukos usa  acknowledged the point. he said the discrepancy was only in the paperwork  but that money had indeed been transferred on 14 december. even so  he told the court that only $480 000 had been in the accounts that day  with the rest arriving a day later.  deutsche bank is involved in the case because it is itself being sued by yukos. it had agreed to loan to an arm of russian state gas firm gazprom the money to bid for yuganskneftegaz  as the yukos unit is formally known. the sale went ahead  despite an order from the us bankruptcy court ordered that it should be stopped. in the end  the auction was won by an unknown shell company for $9.4bn - much less than most assessments of its value - before ending up in the hands of state-controlled oil firm rosneft. rosneft  meanwhile  has agreed to merge with gazprom  bringing a large chunk of russia s very profitable oil business back under state control.  yukos maintains that it filed for bankruptcy in the us because it feared it would not be able to do so in russia. it also said that in the event of going bust  it could offer the chance of restructuring.  it gives us a kind of life after death alternative   said yukos chief executive steven theede. yukos is currently suing four companies - gazprom  its unit gazpromneft  rosneft and the shell company which won the bidding - for their part in yugansk s disposal. it has also threatened to sue the russian government for $28bn. analysts have questioned whether a us court has any jurisdiction over russian companies  while moscow officials have dismissed yukos  legal wrangling as meaningless. yukos claims that the rights of its shareholders have been ignored and that is has been punished for the political ambitions of its founder mikhail khodorkovsky. mr khodorkovsky  once russia s richest man  is in prison  having been charged with fraud and tax evasion and repeatedly denied bail.,yuko accus lie court russian oil firm yuko lie u court attempt stop russian govern sell key product unit court heard unit yugansk sell pay bn £bn back tax bill yuko argu sinc u subsidiari local bank account u court could declar bankrupt stop auction yugansk deutsch bank target yuko lawsuit say document backdat strengthen case deutsch bank evid come first day twoday hear houston lawyer hugh ray told court yuko claim transfer m two texa bank account open new u subsidiari say firm intend reinforc u presenc thu chanc get case heard u court say paper document transact drawn till week yuko make bankruptci applic decemb backdat yuko chief financi offic bruce misamor move u earli decemb set yuko usa acknowledg point say discrep paperwork money inde transfer decemb even told court account day rest arriv day later deutsch bank involv case su yuko agre loan arm russian state ga firm gazprom money bid yuganskneftegaz yuko unit formal know sale go ahead despit order u bankruptci court order stop end auction unknown shell compani bn much less ass valu end hand statecontrol oil firm rosneft rosneft meanwhil agre merg gazprom bring larg chunk russia profit oil busi back state control yuko maintain file bankruptci u fear would abl russia also say event go bust could offer chanc restructur give u kind life death altern say yuko chief execut steven theed yuko current su four compani gazprom unit gazpromneft rosneft shell compani bid part yugansk dispos also threaten sue russian govern bn analyst question whether u court jurisdict russian compani moscow offici dismiss yuko legal wrangl meaningless yuko claim right sharehold ignor punish polit ambit founder mikhail khodorkovski mr khodorkovski russia richest man prison charg fraud tax evas repeatedli deni bail
949,1095,gold falls on imf sale concerns the price of gold has fallen after the international monetary fund (imf) said it will look at ways of using its gold reserves to provide debt relief.  by revaluing its holdings  the imf may be able to sell billions of dollars of gold and use the cash to cancel debts owed by the world s poorest nations. the plan was put forward by g7 finance ministers over the weekend. the price of gold fell to $413.50 an ounce in asia  before rebounding slightly in early european trading.  imf boss rodrigo rato was asked by g7 ministers to carry out a study into the feasibility of revaluing and selling gold reserves.  he is expected to present his conclusions at an imf meeting in washington during april.  whatever happens the market is going to be disconcerted and on the back foot until the april imf meetings   said john reade  an analyst at ubs. the imf values its gold reserves at between $40 and $50 an ounce  a price that was fixed in the 1970s and is about a tenth of the metal s current market value. the imf has 3 217 tonnes of gold  or about 113.5m ounces. bringing the book price of the gold in line with market value would boost the imf s balance sheet  giving it more money to distribute.  this idea has been put forward before  but there now seems to be a more committed political drive to address the issue of global poverty.  this is the first time there has been a mention of the use of gold in a g7 communiqu&#233; for achieving debt relief   said uk chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown. at their meeting in london  g7 finance ministers backed plans to write off up to 100% of the debts owed by some of the world s poorest countries. mr brown said the meeting would be remembered as  the 100% debt relief summit . while debt relief seems to have jumped to the top of the global agenda  not everyone is convinced that selling imf gold is the best way forward. the us  which can veto any plan to sell imf gold should it so choose  said it is looking at other ways of solving the problem.  the us is not convinced that s the necessary way to do it   said treasury under secretary john taylor. canada  a key gold producer  also expressed reservations.,gold fall imf sale concern price gold fall intern monetari fund imf say look way use gold reserv provid debt relief revalu hold imf may abl sell billion dollar gold use cash cancel debt owe world poorest nation plan put forward g financ minist weekend price gold fell ounc asia rebound slightli earli european trade imf bos rodrigo rato ask g minist carri studi feasibl revalu sell gold reserv expect present conclus imf meet washington april whatev happen market go disconcert back foot april imf meet say john read analyst ub imf valu gold reserv ounc price fix s tenth metal current market valu imf tonn gold m ounc bring book price gold line market valu would boost imf balanc sheet give money distribut idea put forward seem commit polit drive address issu global poverti first time mention use gold g communiqu achiev debt relief say uk chancellor exchequ gordon brown meet london g financ minist back plan write debt owe world poorest countri mr brown say meet would rememb debt relief summit debt relief seem jump top global agenda everyon convinc sell imf gold best way forward u veto plan sell imf gold choos say look way solv problem u convinc necessari way say treasuri secretari john taylor canada key gold produc also express reserv

956,870,voters  reject eu by two to one  british voters would reject the european constitution by two to one  according to a poll posing the question the government will put to the country.  the daily telegraph poll suggests that 45% of people would vote against the constitution and 24% in favour. however the yougov poll  which questioned 1 943 british adults online  found 25% did not know how they would vote if forced to decide tomorrow. only 51% of those polled had made up their minds about the constitution. another 7% said they would not vote at all. the poll is believed to be the first to pose the question which the government has chosen for the upcoming referendum  expected in 2006. the constitution will be incorporated into uk law if there is a yes vote.  ballot papers in the poll will ask:  should the united kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the european union   the government unveiled the question which will be asked earlier in the week.  the treaty was signed by all 25 current eu members in rome last october and is due to come into force in november 2006  providing it is ratified by all member states - several of which will hold a referendum. critics say the constitution is a further step towards a federal europe  but advocates say it ensures effective operation of the enlarged 25-state eu.  if we reject this treaty  britain will be isolated and weak in europe   said foreign secretary jack straw  after the question was unveiled. mr straw  along with the rest of the cabinet  will back a  yes  vote. meanwhile  conservative shadow foreign secretary michael ancram said the referendum question  seems straightforward . but he accused the government of trying to confuse the issue by putting the eu referendum question in the same bill as the ratification of the constitution  when they should be treated as  two separate issues .,voter reject eu two one british voter would reject european constitut two one accord poll pose question govern put countri daili telegraph poll suggest peopl would vote constitut favour howev yougov poll question british adult onlin found know would vote forc decid tomorrow poll make mind constitut anoth say would vote poll believ first pose question govern chosen upcom referendum expect constitut incorpor uk law ye vote ballot paper poll ask unit kingdom approv treati establish constitut european union govern unveil question ask earlier week treati sign current eu member rome last octob due come forc novemb provid ratifi member state sever hold referendum critic say constitut step toward feder europ advoc say ensur effect oper enlarg state eu reject treati britain isol weak europ say foreign secretari jack straw question unveil mr straw along rest cabinet back ye vote meanwhil conserv shadow foreign secretari michael ancram say referendum question seem straightforward accus govern tri confus issu put eu referendum question bill ratif constitut treat two separ issu
957,710,sun offers processing by the hour sun microsystems has launched a pay-as-you-go service which will allow customers requiring huge computing power to rent it by the hour.  sun grid costs users $1 (53p) for an hour s worth of processing and storage power on systems maintained by sun. so-called grid computing is the latest buzz phrase in a company which believes that computing capacity is as important a commodity as hardware and software. sun likened grid computing to the development of electricity.  the system could mature in the same way utilities such as electricity and water have developed  said sun s chief operating officer jonathan schwartz.  why build your own grid when you can use ours for a buck an hour   he asked in a webcast launching sun s quarterly network computing event in california. the company will have to persuade data centre managers to adopt a new model but it said it already had interest from customers in the oil  gas and financial services industries.  some of them want to book computing capacity of more than 5 000 processors each  sun said. mr schwartz ran a demonstration of the service  showing how data could be processed in a protein folding experiment. hundreds of servers were used simultaneously  working on the problem for a few seconds each.  although it only took a few seconds  the experiment cost $12 (£6.30) because it had used up 12 hours  worth of computing power. the sun grid relies on solaris  the operating system owned by sun. initially it will house the grid in existing premises and will use idle servers to test software before shipping it to customers. it has not said how much the system will cost to develop but it already has a rival in ibm  which argues that its capacity on-demand service is cheaper than that offered by sun.,sun offer process hour sun microsystem launch payasyougo servic allow custom requir huge comput power rent hour sun grid cost user p hour worth process storag power system maintain sun socal grid comput late buzz phrase compani believ comput capac import commod hardwar softwar sun liken grid comput develop electr system could matur way util electr water develop say sun chief oper offic jonathan schwartz build grid use buck hour ask webcast launch sun quarterli network comput event california compani persuad data centr manag adopt new model say alreadi interest custom oil ga financi servic industri want book comput capac processor sun say mr schwartz ran demonstr servic show data could process protein fold experi hundr server use simultan work problem second although take second experi cost £ use hour worth comput power sun grid reli solari oper system own sun initi hous grid exist premis use idl server test softwar ship custom say much system cost develop alreadi rival ibm argu capac ondemand servic cheaper offer sun

962,1625,hewitt fights back to reach final lleyton hewitt kept his dream of an australian open title alive with a four-set win over andy roddick in friday s second semi-final.  the home favourite will face marat safin in sunday s final after coming through 3-6 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (7-4) 6-1. hewitt fought back from a set down and trailed in both tie-breaks but would not be denied  thrilling the melbourne crowd with a typically battling effort. he is aiming to be the first australian winner since mark edmondson in 1976. hewitt is the first australian to make the final since pat cash lost to mats wilander in 1988  but faces a huge challenge against safin - the conqueror of roger federer. after needing five sets in his last two matches there was reason to think hewitt might struggle for fitness. he certainly made a sluggish start  dropping his opening service game  and roddick dominated with his huge serve as he took the first set.  after 12 tense games in the second  the key moment came when hewitt raised his game in the tie-break to overturn an early mini-break. that energised the crowd but roddick was not finished and raced 4-1 clear in the crucial third before hewitt pegged him back and forced another tie-break. again roddick broke first and again hewitt fought back  taking the lead with a superb backhand pass.  the australian was not to be denied and a disheartened roddick made little impact in the fourth set as hewitt raced to victory  sending the melbourne crowd wild and ensuring the final will be a huge occasion.  it s awesome   said hewitt.  i started preparing for this tournament nine months ago.  i ve done a lot of hard yards to get here.  i ve always said i d do anything to get in the first night final at the australian open. now i ve got my chance.  roddick was furious with himself for failing to take advantage of leads in both tie-breaks.  i m usually pretty money in those   said roddick.  either one of those would have given me a distinct advantage.  i m mad  i felt i was in there with a shot. he put himself in position to win big points. i donated a little more than i would have wanted.  and the american played down the influence of one spectator who appeared to contribute to a double fault by shouting during rodick s service action.  it just took one jackass to shout out   said roddick  adding that the crowd overall was  very respectful .,hewitt fight back reach final lleyton hewitt kept dream australian open titl aliv fourset win andi roddick friday second semifin home favourit face marat safin sunday final come hewitt fought back set trail tiebreak would deni thrill melbourn crowd typic battl effort aim first australian winner sinc mark edmondson hewitt first australian make final sinc pat cash lose mat wiland face huge challeng safin conqueror roger feder need five set last two match reason think hewitt might struggl fit certainli make sluggish start drop open servic game roddick domin huge serv take first set ten game second key moment come hewitt rais game tiebreak overturn earli minibreak energis crowd roddick finish race clear crucial third hewitt peg back forc anoth tiebreak roddick broke first hewitt fought back take lead superb backhand pas australian deni dishearten roddick make littl impact fourth set hewitt race victori send melbourn crowd wild ensur final huge occas awesom say hewitt start prepar tournament nine month ago do lot hard yard get alway say anyth get first night final australian open get chanc roddick furiou fail take advantag lead tiebreak usual pretti money say roddick either one would give distinct advantag mad felt shot put posit win big point donat littl would want american play influenc one spectat appear contribut doubl fault shout rodick servic action take one jackass shout say roddick ad crowd overal respect
963,1363,mobile multimedia slow to catch on there is no doubt that mobile phones sporting cameras and colour screens are hugely popular. consumers swapping old phones for slinkier  dinkier versions are thought to be responsible for a 26% increase in the number of phones sold during the third quarter of 2004  according to analysts gartner more than 167 million handsets were sold between july and september 2004  a period that  according to gartner analyst carolina milanesi is  seldom strong . but although consumers have mobiles that can take and send snaps  sounds and video clips few  so far  are taking the chance to do so.  in fact  the numbers of people not taking and sending pictures  audio and video is growing. figures gathered by continental research shows that 36% of british camera phone users have never sent a multimedia message (mms)  up from 7% in 2003. this is despite the fact that  during the same period  the numbers of camera phones in the uk more than doubled to 7.5 million. getting mobile phone users to send multimedia messages is really important for operators keen to squeeze more cash out of their customers and offset the cost of subsidising the handsets people are buying. the problem they face  said shailendra jain  head of mms firm adamind  is educating people in how to send the multimedia messages using their funky handsets.   also   he said   they have to simplify the interface so its not rocket science in terms of someone understanding it.  research bears out the suspicion that people are not sending multimedia messages because they do not know how to. according to continental research  29% of the people it questioned said they were technophobes that tended to shy away from innovation. only 11% regarded themselves as technically savvy enough to send a picture or video message. the fact that multimedia services are not interoperable across networks and phones only adds to people s reluctance to start sending them  said mr jain.  they ask themselves:  if i m streaming video from one handset to another will it work    he said.  there s a lot of user apprehension about that.   there are other deeper technical reasons why multimedia messages are not being pushed as strongly as they might. andrew bud  executive chairman of messaging firm mblox  said mobile phone operators cap the number of messages that can be circulating at any one time for fear of overwhelming the system.  the rate we can send mms into the mobile network is fairly constant   he said. the reason for this is that there are finite capacities for data traffic on the second generation networks that currently have the most users.  no-one wants to take the risk of swamping these relatively narrow channels so the number of mms messages is capped  said mr bud. this has led to operators finding other technologies  particularly one known as wap-push  to get multimedia to their customers. but when networks do find a good way to get multimedia to their customers  the results can be dramatic. israeli technology firm celltick has found a way to broadcast data across phone networks in a way that does not overwhelm existing bandwidth. one of the first firms to use the celltick service is hutch india  the largest mobile firm in the country. the broadcast system gets multimedia to customers via a rolling menu far faster than would be possible with other systems. while not multimedia messaging  such a system gets people used to seeing their phones as a device that can handle all different types of content. as a result 40% of the subscribers to the hutch alive  which uses celltick s broadcast technology  regularly click for more pictures  sounds and images from the operator.  operators really need to start utilising this tool to reach their customers   said yaron toren  spokesman for celltick. until then  multimedia will be a message that is not getting through.,mobil multimedia slow catch doubt mobil phone sport

964,647,gritty return for prince of persia still basking in the relatively recent glory of last year s sands of time  the dashing prince of persia is back in warrior within  and in a more bellicose mood than last time.  this sequel gives the franchise a grim  gritty new look and ramps up the action and violence. as before  you control the super-athletic prince from a third-person perspective. the time-travelling plot hinges on the dahaka  an all-consuming monster pursuing our hero through the ages. the only way to dispel it is to turn back the clock again and kill the sultry empress of time before she ever creates the sands of time that caused the great beast s creation.  studiously structured though this back story is  everything boils down to old-fashioned fantasy gameplay which proves  on the whole  as dependable as it needs to be. ever since the series  then-groundbreaking beginnings on the commodore amiga  prince of persia has always been about meticulously-animated acrobatic moves  that provide an energetic blend of leaping preposterously between pieces of scenery and lopping off enemies  body parts.  those flashy moves are back in full evidence  and tremendous fun to perform and perfect. combining them at speed is the best fun  although getting a handle of doing so takes practice and plenty of skill. until you reach that point  it is a haphazard business. all too often  you will perform a stunning triple somersault  pirouette off a wall  knock out three enemies in one glorious swoop  before plummeting purposefully over a cliff to your doom. that in turn can mean getting set back an annoyingly long distance  for you can only save at the fountains dotted along the path. the expected fiendish puzzles are all present and correct  but combat is what is really been stepped up  and there is more of it than before. the game s developers have combined acrobatic flair with gruesome slaying techniques in some wonderfully imaginative ways. slicing foes down the middle is one particularly entertaining method of seeing them off.  warrior within is a very slick package; the game s intro movie is so phenomenally good that it actually does an ultimate disservice once the game itself commences.  it is on a par with the jaw-dropping opening sequence of onimusha 3 earlier this year  and when the game begins  it is something of an anti-climax. that said  the graphics are excellent  and indeed among the most striking and satisfying elements of the game. the music is probably the worst aspect - a merit-free heavy metal soundtrack that you will swiftly want to turn off. there is something strangely unsatisfying about the game. perhaps precisely because its graphics and mechanics are so good that the story and overall experience are not quite as engaging as they should be. somehow it adds up to less than the sum of its parts  and is more technically impressive than it is outright enjoyable. but that is not to say warrior within is anything other than a superb adventure that most will thoroughly enjoy. it just does not quite take the character to the new heights that might have been hoped for.,gritti return princ persia still bask rel recent glori last year sand time dash princ persia back warrior within bellicos mood last time sequel give franchis grim gritti new look ramp action violenc control superathlet princ thirdperson perspect timetravel plot hing dahaka allconsum monster pursu hero age way dispel turn back clock kill sultri empress time ever creat sand time caus great beast creation studious structur though back stori everyth boil oldfashion fantasi gameplay prove whole depend need ever sinc seri thengroundbreak begin commodor amiga princ persia alway meticulouslyanim acrobat move provid energet blend leap preposter piec sceneri lop enemi bodi part flashi move back full evid tremend fun perform perfect combin speed best fun although get handl take practic plenti skill reach point haphazard busi often perform stun tripl somersault pirouett wall knock three enemi one gloriou swoop plummet purpos cliff doom turn mean get set back annoyingli long distanc save fountain dot along path expect fiendish puzzl present correct combat realli step game develop combin acrobat flair gruesom slay techniqu wonder imagin way slice foe middl one particularli entertain method see warrior within slick packag game intro movi phenomen good actual ultim disservic game commenc par jawdrop open sequenc onimusha earlier year game begin someth anticlimax say graphic excel inde among strike satisfi element game music probabl bad aspect meritfre heavi metal soundtrack swiftli want turn someth strang unsatisfi game perhap precis graphic mechan good stori overal experi quit engag somehow add less sum part technic impress outright enjoy say warrior within anyth superb adventur thoroughli enjoy quit take charact new height might hope

967,473,anti-terror plan faces first test plans to allow home secretary charles clarke to place terror suspects under house arrest without trial are set for their first real test in parliament.  tories  lib dems and some labour mps are poised to vote against the plans. mr clarke says the powers are needed to counter terror threats. opponents say only judges  not politicians  should be able to order detention of uk citizens. the government is expected to win wednesday s vote in the commons  but faces a battle in the house of lords.  the prevention of terrorism bill was published on tuesday. it proposes  control orders   which would mean house arrest in the most serious cases  and curfews  electronic tagging and limits on telephone and internet access for other suspects.  the two opposition parties are particularly worried that the control orders would initially be imposed on the say-so of the home secretary  rather than a judge. tory shadow home secretary david davis warned of the potential for miscarriages of justice  like the guildford four - for which tony blair recently apologised - as a result of the pressure on politicians to lock up terror suspects.  those pressures would be much more for a politician than they would on a judge and that s why we have serious concerns abut that approach   he told bbc radio 4 s today programme.  mr clarke says he does not intend to use the house arrest powers now - even for the 11 current terror detainees. he also said that any decision he made would be reviewed by a judge within seven days. the foreign terror suspects currently detained are mostly held at london s belmarsh prison. they are held under laws which the law lords have ruled break human rights rules - and which are due to expire on 14 march.  the new powers  designed to replace the existing laws and meet the law lords  concerns  would apply to british as well as foreign terror suspects. critics say that giving politicians the power to deprive uk citizens of their freedom is the biggest attack on civil liberties for 300 years. opposition mps are also angry they will have only two days - wednesday and next monday - to debate the new plans before they pass to the house of lords. but the government says the existing powers run out soon so must be replaced urgently.  in a rare move  the tories and lib dems have jointly tabled a motion opposing the new bill  saying the house arrest plans are  excessive . it argues decisions should be taken on a higher standard of proof and the plan  wrongly infringes the right to liberty  by failing to bring terrorists to trial where there is evidence. mr davis told today:  it gives a minister  for the first time in modern history  the right to detain without trial  without showing the evidence and indeed  in some respects  almost the allegation against the individual concerned.   he questioned why there was  such a rush  to introduce the legislation when mr clarke had indicated he was not planning to use the house arrest powers straight away. liberal democrat home affairs spokesman mark oaten said:  we believe it should be the judge that takes decisions  not politicians.  mr clarke said the security services and police backed his measures and it would be  rash and negligent  to ignore their advice. nobody should doubt that terrorists at home and abroad wanted to attack the uk and its interests  he argued.,antiterror plan face first test plan allow home secretari charl clark place terror suspect hous arrest without trial set first real test parliament torus lib dem labour mp poi vote plan mr clark say power need counter terror threat oppon say judg politician abl order detent uk citizen govern expect win wednesday vote common face battl hous lord prevent terror bill publish tuesday propos control order would mean hous arrest seriou case curfew electron tag limit telephon internet access suspect two opposit parti particularli worri control order would initi impos sayso home secretari rather judg torus shadow home secretari david davi warn potenti miscarriag justic like guildford four toni blair recent apologis result pressur politician lock terror suspect pressur would much politician would judg seriou concern abut approach told bbc radio today programm mr clark say intend use hous arrest power even current terror detaine also say decis make would review judg within seven day foreign terror suspect current detain mostli held london belmarsh prison held law law lord rule break human right rule due expir march new power design replac exist law meet law lord concern would appli british well foreign terror suspect critic say give politician power depriv uk citizen freedom big attack civil liberti year opposit mp also angri two day wednesday next monday debat new plan pas hous lord govern say exist power run soon must replac urgent rare move torus lib dem jointli tabl motion oppos new bill say hous arrest plan excess argu decis take high standard proof plan wrongli infring right liberti fail bring terrorist trial evid mr davi told today give minist first time modern histori right detain without trial without show evid inde respect almost alleg individu concern question rush introduc legisl mr clark indic plan use hous arrest power straight away liber democrat home affair spokesman mark oaten say believ judg take decis politician mr clark say secur servic polic back measur would rash neglig ignor advic nobodi doubt terrorist home abroad want attack uk interest argu

971,1526,tories attack eu asylum moves david blunkett has been accused of using the  politics of confusion  to disguise new eu immigration measures.  tory spokesman david davis told mps the uk was losing its power of veto over who was allowed to come to britain. the eu has opted to adopt qualified majority voting in this area - previously measures needed unanimous agreement from all member states. mr blunkett told mps the uk would still be able to reject proposals on immigration it did not agree with.  he argued closer co-operation with europe over asylum and immigration was crucial to controlling the flow of people into the uk.  if we don t like what other eu countries do on immigration and nationality we have the right to opt-in or out to suit the british people   he said. the home secretary was responding to an emergency question from his tory opposite number mr davis.  the government is employing the politics of confusion - i think  deliberately   argued mr davis.  by confusing the country it hopes no one will notice the disappearance of the asylum and immigration veto.  on monday tony blair insisted closer co-operation did not mean losing control of british borders. he said an enlarged 25-member eu needs a streamlined decision making process. mr davis said once britain had opted into policies then it could not opt out - leaving the uk open to unfavourable interpretations of what those policies actually meant.  he accused the government of being  pathetic  when it came to its efforts over immigration and asylum and of  surrendering  on the issue. and he asked why the government was agreeing to the measure on asylum and immigration now when the whole issue was part of the eu constitution  which voters in the uk had been promised a referendum over. mr blair told his monthly news conference britain had the  best of both worlds  and would keep the veto.  there is no question of britain giving up our veto on our border controls   he said.  with the treaty of amsterdam seven years ago  we secured the absolute right to opt in to any of the asylum and immigration provisions that we wanted to in europe.  mr blunkett met his eu counterparts in luxembourg on monday to consider proposals aimed at streamlining decision making on the issue.  the 25 member-states are expected to scrap the requirement for unanimous agreement on immigration policy  in favour of the qualified majority voting (qmv) system. under this scheme larger states such as britain are expected to have more power than the smaller eu states. britain is expected to retain an  opt-in  right which will allow it to ignore any measures it disagrees with. liberal democrat spokesman mark oaten called the change pragmatic and argued it gave a better chance of producing a european asylum solution.  if we don t work together it means some countries can ignore their responsibilities at the expense of their neighbours   said mr oaten.  the liberal democrats have long argued that britain should be a safe haven for asylum seekers but it s right that we don t do this in isolation.,torus attack eu asylum move david blunkett accus use polit confus disguis new eu immigr measur torus spokesman david davi told mp uk lose power veto allow come britain eu opt adopt qualifi major vote area previous measur need unanim agreement member state mr blunkett told mp uk would still abl reject propos immigr agre argu closer cooper europ asylum immigr crucial control flow peopl uk like eu countri immigr nation right optin suit british peopl say home secretari respond emerg question torus opposit number mr davi govern employ polit confus think deliber argu mr davi confus countri hope one notic disappear asylum immigr veto monday toni blair insist closer cooper mean lose control british border say enlarg member eu need streamlin decis make process mr davi say britain opt polici could opt leav uk open unfavour interpret polici actual meant accus govern pathet come effort immigr asylum surrend issu ask govern agre measur asylum immigr whole issu part eu constitut voter uk promis referendum mr blair told monthli news confer britain best world would keep veto question britain give veto border control say treati amsterdam seven year ago secur absolut right opt asylum immigr provis want europ mr blunkett met eu counterpart luxembourg monday consid propos aim streamlin decis make issu memberst expect scrap requir unanim agreement immigr polici favour qualifi major vote qmv system scheme large state britain expect power small eu state britain expect retain optin right allow ignor measur disagre liber democrat spokesman mark oaten call chang pragmat argu give well chanc produc european asylum solut work togeth mean countri ignor respons expens neighbour say mr oaten liber democrat long argu britain safe asylum seeker right isol
972,225,eu-us seeking deal on air dispute the eu and us have agreed to begin talks on ending subsidies given to aircraft makers  eu trade commissioner peter mandelson has announced.  both sides hope to reach a negotiated deal over state aid received by european aircraft maker airbus and its us rival boeing  mr mandelson said. airbus and boeing accuse each other of benefiting from illegal subsidies. mr mandelson said the eu and us hoped to avoid having to resolve the dispute at the world trade organisation (wto).   with this agreement the eu and us have confirmed their willingness to resolve the dispute which has arisen between them   mr mandelson said.  i hope our negotiations in the next three months will lead to an agreement ending subsidies to development and production of large civil aircraft.  last year  the us terminated an agreement with the eu  reached in 1992  which limits the subsidies countries can hand over to civil aircraft makers. the us filed a complaint against brussels with the wto over state aid to airbus  prompting a retaliatory eu complaint over us support for boeing. however  both sides agreed to suspend their requests for wto arbitration at the beginning of december  to allow bilateral talks to continue. eads and bae systems  the european defence and aerospace firms which own airbus  welcomed mr mandelson s announcement.  it has always been preferable that any differences between the us and europe on this matter be overcome through constructive discussion rather than through legal recourse   the companies said in a joint statement.  separately  the world s largest package delivery company  ups  said it had placed an order for 10 airbus a380 superjumbo freight-carrying jets  with an option to buy 10 more of the triple-decker aircraft. the us company said it needed to expand its air freight capacity following strong international growth  and would begin receiving deliveries of the a380s from 2009. however  ups said it was cutting a previous order for smaller airbus a300s from 90 planes to 53. so far  airbus has delivered 40 a300s to ups. airbus overtook boeing as the world s largest manufacturer of commercial airliners in 2003.,euu seek deal air disput eu u agre begin talk end subsidi give aircraft maker eu trade commission peter mandelson announc side hope reach negoti deal state aid receiv european aircraft maker airbu u rival boe mr mandelson say airbu boe accus benefit illeg subsidi mr mandelson say eu u hope avoid resolv disput world trade organis wto agreement eu u confirm willing resolv disput arisen mr mandelson say hope negoti next three month lead agreement end subsidi develop product larg civil aircraft last year u termin agreement eu reach limit subsidi countri hand civil aircraft maker u file complaint brussel wto state aid airbu prompt retaliatori eu complaint u support boe howev side agre suspend request wto arbitr begin decemb allow bilater talk continu ead bae system european defenc aerospac firm airbu welcom mr mandelson announc alway prefer differ u europ matter overcom construct discus rather legal recours compani say joint statement separ world large packag deliveri compani up say place order airbu a superjumbo freightcarri jet option buy tripledeck aircraft u compani say need expand air freight capac follow strong intern growth would begin receiv deliveri a howev up say cut previou order small airbu a plane far airbu deliv a up airbu overtook boe world large manufactur commerci airlin
973,1874,bank voted 8-1 for no rate change the decision to keep interest rates on hold at 4.75% earlier this month was passed 8-1 by the bank of england s rate-setting body  minutes have shown.  one member of the bank s monetary policy committee (mpc) - paul tucker - voted to raise rates to 5%. the news surprised some analysts who had expected the latest minutes to show another unanimous decision. worries over growth rates and consumer spending were behind the decision to freeze rates  the minutes showed. the bank s latest inflation report  released last week  had noted that the main reason inflation might fall was weaker consumer spending.  however  mpc member paul tucker voted for a quarter point rise in interest rates to 5%. he argued that economic growth was picking up  and that the equity  credit and housing markets had been stronger than expected.  the bank s minutes said that risks to the inflation forecast were  sufficiently to the downside  to keep rates on hold at its latest meeting. however  the minutes added:  some members noted that an increase might be warranted in due course if the economy evolved in line with the central projection . ross walker  uk economist at royal bank of scotland  said he was surprised that a dissenting vote had been made so soon. he said the minutes appeared to be  trying to get the market to focus on the possibility of a rise in rates .  if the economy pans out as they expect then they are probably going to have to hike rates.  however  he added  any rate increase is not likely to happen until later this year  with mpc members likely to look for a more sustainable pick up in consumer spending before acting.,bank vote rate chang decis keep interest rate hold earlier month pas bank england rateset bodi minut show one member bank monetari polici committe mpc paul tucker vote rais rate news surpris analyst expect late minut show anoth unanim decis worri growth rate consum spend behind decis freez rate minut show bank late inflat report releas last week note main reason inflat might fall weaker consum spend howev mpc member paul tucker vote quarter point rise interest rate argu econom growth pick equiti credit hous market strong expect bank minut say risk inflat forecast suffici downsid keep rate hold late meet howev minut ad member note increas might warrant due cours economi evolv line central project ross walker uk economist royal bank scotland say surpris dissent vote make soon say minut appear tri get market focu possibl rise rate economi pan expect probabl go hike rate howev ad rate increas like happen later year mpc member like look sustain pick consum spend act
974,1428,gamers could drive high-definition tv  films  and games have been gearing up for some time now for the next revolution to transform the quality of what is on our screens.  it is called high-definition - hd for short - and it is already hugely popular in japan and the us. it is set  according to analysts  to do for images what cds did for sound. different equipment able to receive hd signals is needed though and is expensive. but europe s gamers may be the early adopters to drive demand. europeans will have to wait until at least 2006 until they see mainstream hdtv.  to view it  it needs to be transmitted in hd format  and people need special receivers and displays that can handle the high-quality resolution. the next generation of consoles  however  are expected to start appearing at the end of 2005  start of 2006. and most new computer displays and plasma sets are already capable of handling such high-resolution pictures.  in the next generation [of consoles] hd support is mandatory   dr mark tuffy games systems director at digital content firm thx told the bbc news website.  every game is going to be playable in hd.  so consumers who have gone out and spent all this money on hdtvs  and who have no content to watch  are going to be blown away by these really high-detail pictures.  it s going to change really the way they look at gaming.   at the end of last year  chris deering  sony s european president  made a prediction that 20 million european households would have hdtv sets by 2008. a previous prediction from analysts datamonitor put the figure at 4.6 million by 2008  an increase from an estimated 50 000 sets at the end of 2003. but those in europe may see little point in buying what is quite an expensive bit of technology - about £2 000 - if there are few programmes or films to watch on them. satellite broadcaster bskyb is planning hdtv services in 2006 and the bbc intends to produce all of its content in hd by 2010.  until broadcast rights  format standards - and the practicalities of updating equipment - are agreed  tv content will be limited. all tv images are made up of pixels which go across the screen  and scan lines which go down the screen. most standard uk tv pictures are made up of 625 lines and about 700 pixels. hd offers up to 1 080 active lines  with each line made up of 1 920 pixels. this means the picture is up to six times as sharp as standard tv.  probably  in the uk [gaming] is going to be the only thing you are going to really be able to show off  as in  look what this tv can do   until hd is really adopted by broadcasters   explains dr tuffy. but gamers are also the ideal target audience for hd because they always crave better quality graphics  and more immersive gaming experiences. they are used to spending money on hardware to match a game s requirements. demographics have changed too and the  sweet spot  for the games industry is the gamer in his or her late 20s. this means they are likely to have higher disposable incomes and can afford the price of big-screen  high-definition display technologies and hd projectors  earlier than others.  higher capacity storage discs  such as hd-dvd and blue-ray   are set to be standard in the next round of games consoles - allowing developers more room for detailed graphics.  for console developers though  hd offers some production changes. it could make games production slightly more expensive  thinks dr tuffy.  but we may see the cross-platform development of games becoming more common because they will more easily be able to take a pc game and apply it to a console   he says.  you are literally going to get to the point  with a lord of the rings game for example  is going to be closer and closer to the actual film  especially the cgi stuff from the dvd.  and the transition when they move from a cut scene to the game  just now they have almost got it seamless.  with hd  he says  the transition will be completely seamless and the same quality as the big-screen cinema release. this could herald an increasing convergence between the film and gaming industry. but it may not be until the generation after the next games consoles where the two industries really collide. at that point  says dr tuffy  games could become more or less interactive movies.,gamer could drive highdefinit tv film game gear time next revolut transform qualiti screen call highdefinit hd short alreadi huge popular japan u set accord analyst imag cd sound differ equip abl receiv hd signal need though expens europ gamer may earli adopt drive demand european wait least see mainstream hdtv view need transmit hd format peopl need special receiv display handl highqual resolut next gener consol howev expect start appear end start new comput display plasma set alreadi capabl handl highresolut pictur next gener consol hd support mandatori dr mark tuffi game system director digit content firm thx told bbc news websit everi game go playabl hd consum go spent money hdtv content watch go blown away realli highdetail pictur go chang realli way look game end last year chri deer soni european presid make predict million european household would hdtv set previou predict analyst datamonitor put figur million increas estim set end europ may see littl point buy quit expens bit technolog £ programm film watch satellit broadcast bskyb plan hdtv servic bbc intend produc content hd broadcast right format standard practic updat equip agre tv content limit tv imag make pixel go across screen scan line go screen standard uk tv pictur make line pixel hd offer activ line line make pixel mean pictur six time sharp standard tv probabl uk game go thing go realli abl show look tv hd realli adopt broadcast explain dr tuffi gamer also ideal target audienc hd alway crave well qualiti graphic immers game experi use spend money hardwar match game requir demograph chang sweet spot game industri gamer late s mean like high dispos incom afford price bigscreen highdefinit display technolog hd projector earlier other high capac storag disc hddvd blueray set standard next round game consol allow develop room detail graphic consol develop though hd offer product chang could make game product slightli expens think dr tuffi may see crossplatform develop game becom common easili abl take pc game appli consol say liter go get point lord ring game exampl go closer closer actual film especi cgi stuff dvd transit move cut scene game almost get seamless hd say transit complet seamless qualiti bigscreen cinema releas could herald increas converg film game industri may gener next game consol two industri realli collid point say dr tuffi game could becom less interact movi

976,1988,tories unveil quango blitz plans plans to abolish 162 quangos have been unveiled by the conservatives as part of their effort to show how government red tape can be cut.  six government units would also be scrapped under proposals which the tories say would save more than £4.3bn. among the targets are strategic health authorities and the new fair access regulator for universities. tory frontbencher john redwood said britain needed a slimmer government and lower taxes to be competitive.  the plans would abolish regional assemblies and other regional bodies  such as boards tackling industrial development and housing. their powers would be returned to elected local councils or national government. the tories say the strategic health authorities are not needed as it is better that local people  rather than officials  run hospitals and surgeries.  announcing the plans  mr redwood said:  mr blair has forgotten the interests of taxpayers  and has broken the pledges he made.  far from improving public services  spending taxpayers  money on quangos has led only to more bureaucrats  more regulation and higher taxes.  his party leader  michael howard  argued a change in direction was needed to get a grip on spending.  labour are creating two britains: the britain of the forgotten majority and bureaucratic britain   he said.  in the real world  people are working harder just to stand still. they ve seen their pensions knocked for six.  they re being squeezed by extra taxes. the forgotten majority are paying the price of bureaucratic britain.   the government has announced plans to cut 100 000 civil servants as part of its efficiency drive. but chief secretary to the treasury paul boateng attacked the tory plans.  the conservatives are committed to cutting labour s public spending plans by a massive £35 billion   he said.  cuts on this scale cannot be found from cutting  bureaucracy  but would require massive cuts to front-line public services such as schools  hospitals and the police.  the liberal democrats have said they would cut the number of whitehall departments to make sure money reaches frontline services.,torus unveil quango blitz plan plan abolish quango unveil conserv part effort show govern red tape cut six govern unit would also scrap propos torus say would save £bn among target strateg health author new fair access regul univers torus frontbench john redwood say britain need slimmer govern low tax competit plan would abolish region assembl region bodi board tackl industri develop hous power would return elect local council nation govern torus say strateg health author need well local peopl rather offici run hospit surgeri announc plan mr redwood say mr blair forgotten interest taxpay broken pledg make far improv public servic spend taxpay money quango lead bureaucrat regul high tax parti leader michael howard argu chang direct need get grip spend labour creat two britain britain forgotten major bureaucrat britain say real world peopl work harder stand still see pension knock six squeez extra tax forgotten major pay price bureaucrat britain govern announc plan cut civil servant part effici drive chief secretari treasuri paul boateng attack torus plan conserv commit cut labour public spend plan massiv £ billion say cut scale found cut bureaucraci would requir massiv cut frontlin public servic school hospit polic liber democrat say would cut number whitehal depart make sure money reach frontlin servic

978,1348,mps tout lords replacement plan a group of mps has tried to raise the pressure on tony blair over reform to the house of lords by publishing a detailed blueprint for change.  the cross-party group has unveiled a draft bill proposing a smaller second chamber in which 70% of members would be elected. mps and peers have failed to agree on reform since 1999 when 600 hereditaries lost their seats. the group says it can win support for removing the last 92 hereditaries. the government postponed plans to remove the remaining hereditary peers because they said they were unlikely to succeed after opposition in the lords. tony blair has argued. there needs to be consensus on reforms. there have been suggestions there will be proposals for changing at least the powers of the lords in labour s manifesto.  but the all-party group  including tories ken clarke and sir george young  labour s robin cook and tony wright and liberal democrat paul tyler  is confident its plan would win support from a  large majority . and they list former conservative leader william hague and former labour leader neil kinnock as supporters of the plans. the group says the british public and a clear majority of mps support replacing the lords with a largely-elected second chamber. their plan would see the house of lords being renamed the second chamber of parliament  and its members would be known as mscps.  there would be 385 mscps  including 270 elected members  87 appointed members and 16 bishops. they would serve for between 12 and 14 years. mr cook said holding elections for mscps on the same day as those for mps might help motivate the electorate and increase voter turnout. he added:  over the last year i have seen many statements from senior figures of this government insisting the public must have the right of choice.  what could be more important than a choice of the people who sit in our parliament    the group believes pressure is growing for change and the government s current position is unsustainable. it wants all three main parties to include a commitment to a  largely democratic  second chamber in their manifestos. mr clarke said the issue  went to the heart of reforming the health of the british political system . and mr tyler said the prime minister s view that there was no agreement on the shape of the future of the lords was flawed.  the problem  i think  in the prime minister s mind is there doesn t appear to be a consensus that includes him   he said.  we are providing a consensus . the elect the lords campaign said the draft bill was an important contribution to the debate.  we believe this draft bill is detailed enough to form the basis of closer parliamentary scrutiny   said co-ordinator peter facey.  in lieu of any other such clear proposals  the government must permit that to happen.,mp tout lord replac plan group mp tri rais pressur toni blair reform hous lord publish detail blueprint chang crossparti group unveil draft bill propos small second chamber member would elect mp peer fail agre reform sinc hereditari lose seat group say win support remov last hereditari govern postpon plan remov remain hereditari peer say unlik succeed opposit lord toni blair argu need consensu reform suggest propos chang least power lord labour manifesto allparti group includ torus ken clark sir georg young labour robin cook toni wright liber democrat paul tyler confid plan would win support larg major list former conserv leader william hagu former labour leader neil kinnock support plan group say british public clear major mp support replac lord largelyelect second chamber plan would see hous lord renam second chamber parliament member would know mscp would mscp includ elect member appoint member bishop would serv year mr cook say hold elect mscp day mp might help motiv elector increas voter turnout ad last year see mani statement senior figur govern insist public must right choic could import choic peopl sit parliament group believ pressur grow chang govern current posit unsustain want three main parti includ commit larg democrat second chamber manifesto mr clark say issu go heart reform health british polit system mr tyler say prime minist view agreement shape futur lord flaw problem think prime minist mind appear consensu includ say provid consensu elect lord campaign say draft bill import contribut debat believ draft bill detail enough form basi closer parliamentari scrutini say coordin peter facey lieu clear propos govern must permit happen
979,1292,man utd stroll to cup win wayne rooney made a winning return to everton as manchester united cruised into the fa cup quarter-finals.  rooney received a hostile reception  but goals in each half from quinton fortune and cristiano ronaldo silenced the jeers at goodison park. fortune headed home after 23 minutes before ronaldo scored when nigel martyn parried paul scholes  free-kick. marcus bent missed everton s best chance when roy carroll  who was later struck by a missile  saved at his feet.  rooney s return was always going to be a potential flashpoint  and he was involved in an angry exchange with a spectator even before kick-off. and rooney s every touch was met with a deafening chorus of jeers from the crowd that once idolised the 19-year-old. everton started brightly and fortune needed to be alert to scramble away a header from bent near the goal-line. but that was the cue for united to take complete control with a supreme passing display on a goodison park pitch that was cutting up. fortune gave united the lead after 23 minutes  rising to meet ronaldo s cross from eight yards after the portuguese youngster had been allowed too much time and space by the hapless gary naysmith. united dominated without creating too many clear-cut chances  and they almost paid the price for not making the most of their domination two minutes before half-time. mikel arteta played a superb ball into the area but bent  played onside by gabriel heintze  hesitated and carroll plunged at his fee to save. united almost doubled their lead after 48 minutes when ronaldo s low drive from 25 yards took a deflection off tony hibbert  but martyn dived to save brilliantly. and martyn came to everton s rescue three minutes later when rooney s big moment almost arrived as he raced clean through  but once again the veteran keeper was in outstanding form. but there was nothing martyn could do when united doubled their lead after 57 minutes as they doubled their advantage. scholes  free-kick took a deflection  and martyn could only parry the ball out for ronaldo  who reacted first to score easily. everton s problems worsened when james mcfadden limped off with an injury. and there may be further trouble ahead for everton after goalkeeper carroll required treatment after he was struck on the head by a missile thrown from behind the goal. rooney s desperate search for a goal on his return to everton was halted again by martyn in injury-time when he outpaced stubbs  but once again martyn denied the england striker.  - manchester united coach sir alex ferguson:  it was a fantastic performance by us. in fairness i think everton have missed a couple of players and got some young players out.  the boy ronaldo is a fantastic player. he s persistent and never gives in.  i don t know how many fouls he had he gets up and wants the ball again  he s truly a fabulous player.  everton: martyn  hibbert  yobo  stubbs  naysmith  osman  carsley  arteta  kilbane  mcfadden  bent. subs: wright  pistone  weir  plessis  vaughan. manchester united: carroll  gary neville  brown  ferdinand  heinze  ronaldo  phil neville  keane  scholes  fortune  rooney. subs: howard  giggs  smith  miller  spector. referee: r styles (hampshire),man utd stroll cup win wayn rooney make win return everton manchest unit cruis fa cup quarterfin rooney receiv hostil recept goal half quinton fortun cristiano ronaldo silenc jeer goodison park fortun head home minut ronaldo score nigel martyn parri paul schole freekick marcu bent miss everton best chanc roy carrol later struck missil save foot rooney return alway go potenti flashpoint involv angri exchang spectat even kickoff rooney everi touch met deafen choru jeer crowd idolis yearold everton start brightli fortun need alert scrambl away header bent near goallin cue unit take complet control suprem pas display goodison park pitch cut fortun give unit lead minut rise meet ronaldo cross eight yard portugues youngster allow much time space hapless gari naysmith unit domin without creat mani clearcut chanc almost paid price make domin two minut halftim mikel arteta play superb ball area bent play onsid gabriel heintz hesit carrol plung fee save unit almost doubl lead minut ronaldo low drive yard take deflect toni hibbert martyn dive save brilliantli martyn come everton rescu three minut later rooney big moment almost arriv race clean veteran keeper outstand form noth martyn could unit doubl lead minut doubl advantag schole freekick take deflect martyn could parri ball ronaldo react first score easili everton problem worsen jame mcfadden limp injuri may troubl ahead everton goalkeep carrol requir treatment struck head missil thrown behind goal rooney desper search goal return everton halt martyn injurytim outpac stubb martyn deni england striker manchest unit coach sir alex ferguson fantast perform u fair think everton miss coupl player get young player boy ronaldo fantast player persist never give know mani foul get want ball truli fabul player everton martyn hibbert yobo stubb naysmith osman carsley arteta kilban mcfadden bent sub wright piston weir plessi vaughan manchest unit carrol gari nevil brown ferdinand heinz ronaldo phil nevil kean schole fortun rooney sub howard gigg smith miller spector refere r style hampshir

this week the chancellor has offered the economics of complacency.  there are serious challenges ahead from the falling dollar and from the rapid downturn in the uk housing market and rising personal debt. but they have not been confronted.  mr brown rejected the lib dem s call to open up the government s books to the national audit office  saying decisions on tax and spending should be made by ministers. some economists say his forecasts on public finances are wishful thinking. bbc economic editor evan davis said the figures were plausible but also a gamble.  mr brown s insistence he was not  gloating  was a pointed rebuttal of a warning from new european commissioner peter mandelson. in his speech  he set out a 10-year childcare strategy for if labour wins the next election.  it includes a £285m cash injection to extend paid maternity leave from six months to nine  with parents able to transfer leave from the mother to the father. he also promised to increase free nursery education for three and four-year-olds to 15 hours from april 2007. and funds would be provided to keep schools open from 0800 to 1800gmt to look after children while their parents were at work. taken together  the measures would create a  welfare state that is truly family-friendly for the first time in its history   said mr brown. he also announced a cash hand-out for older pensioners  with payments of £50 for the over-70s as part of the winter fuel allowance. in a move ministers say should keep council tax rises below 5% next year  the chancellor said he was providing an extra £1bn for local councils. the money is expected to come from government departments such as health and education.  mr brown said he was set to meet his two fiscal rules - to borrow only to invest and keep debt  low and sustainable  - both in this economic cycle and the next. borrowing figures for 2003/4 are £35bn - £2.5bn less than the £37.5bn predicted in march s budget  as already announced by the office for national statistics. borrowing is tipped to fall to £31bn by 2005/06 - but that is still £2bn more than mr brown predicted in his march budget. inflation would be 1.75% next year and 2% in the years to follow  mr brown forecast. he also pledged an extra £105m for security and counter-terrorism. business groups have welcomed efforts to improve competitiveness and invest more in skills and innovation. but there worries about the costs of more family-friendly working. simon sweetman  from the federation of small businesses  said:  the proposals on maternity leave have clearly been made with a general election in mind and with little thought to the impact on small employers.,brown shrug economi fear gordon brown freez petrol duti increas fund £bn packag avoid big council tax rise boost childcar matern leav upbeat prebudget report slightli increas borrow insist econom target would met chancellor also hail long period growth uk industri histori deni gloat oliv letwin torus attack govern red tape debt dub mr brown sir wastealot shadow chancellor say mr brown golden rule turn dross hand say borrow spend invest predict debt come year total £bn mr letwin told mp tide go chancellor credibl spend borrow tax much get valu taxpay money vincent cabl liber democrat accus mr brown duck tough choic say last week prime minist give u polit fear week chancellor offer econom complac seriou challeng ahead fall dollar rapid downturn uk hous market rise person debt confront mr brown reject lib dem call open govern book nation audit offic say decis tax spend make minist economist say forecast public financ wish think bbc econom editor evan davi say figur plausibl also gambl mr brown insist gloat point rebutt warn new european commission peter mandelson speech set year childcar strategi labour win next elect includ £m cash inject extend paid matern leav six month nine parent abl transfer leav mother father also promis increas free nurseri educ three fouryearold hour april fund would provid keep school open gmt look child parent work take togeth measur would creat welfar state truli familyfriendli first time histori say mr brown also announc cash handout old pension payment £ over part winter fuel allow move minist say keep council tax rise next year chancellor say provid extra £bn local council money expect come govern depart health educ mr brown say set meet two fiscal rule borrow invest keep debt low sustain econom cycl next borrow figur £bn £bn less £bn predict march budget alreadi announc offic nation statist borrow tip fall £bn still £bn mr brown predict march budget inflat would next year year follow mr brown forecast also pledg extra £m secur counterterror busi group welcom effort improv competit invest skill innov worri cost familyfriendli work simon sweetman feder small busi say propos matern leav clearli make gener elect mind littl thought impact small employ

994,1402,brazil plays down varig rescue the brazilian government has played down claims that it could step in to save the country s biggest airline.  brazil s airport authority chief carlos wilson had claimed the government was on the brink of stepping in to save varig  brazil s flagship airline. however  the country s vice president jose alencar has said the government still is looking for a solution. varig is struggling under a huge debt burden of an estimated debt of 6.5 billion reais ($2.3bn or £1.2bn). asked whether a rescue was on the cards following a meeting of the country s congress to discuss the airline s crisis  mr alencar replied:  no  i don t think so. we will see.   earlier  mr wilson had said that president luiz inacio lula da silva has decided to step in and a decree of some kind of intervention could be signed this week.  in practice  it will be an intervention  although this is not the technical name used   he said. an intervention means that the government would take administrative control of the company and its finances. for that to happen varig s main shareholder  the non-profit ruben berta foundation which represents the airline s employees  would have to be removed  mr wilson said. however  no jobs would be lost and the airline would keep on flying  he added. varig  which operates in 18 countries apart from brazil  has been driven to the brink of collapse because of the country s economic downturn.  the depreciation of brazil s currency has had a direct impact on the airline s dollar debt as well as some of its costs. business has improved recently with demand for air travel increasing and a recovery in the brazilian economy. the airline could also win a sizeable windfall from a compensation claim against the government. on tuesday the courts awarded varig 2bn reais ($725m)  after ruling in favour of its compensation claim against the government for freezing tariffs from 1985 to 1992. but the government can appeal the decision.,brazil play varig rescu brazilian govern play claim could step save countri big airlin brazil airport author chief carlo wilson claim govern brink step save varig brazil flagship airlin howev countri vice presid jose alencar say govern still look solut varig struggl huge debt burden estim debt billion reai bn £bn ask whether rescu card follow meet countri congress discus airlin crisi mr alencar repli think see earlier mr wilson say presid luiz inacio lula da silva decid step decre kind intervent could sign week practic intervent although technic name use say intervent mean govern would take administr control compani financ happen varig main sharehold nonprofit ruben berta foundat repres airlin employe would remov mr wilson say howev job would lose airlin would keep fli ad varig oper countri apart brazil driven brink collaps countri econom downturn depreci brazil currenc direct impact airlin dollar debt well cost busi improv recent demand air travel increas recoveri brazilian economi airlin could also win sizeabl windfal compens claim govern tuesday court award varig bn reai m rule favour compens claim govern freez tariff govern appeal decis
995,848,bbc  should allow more scrutiny  mps have urged the bbc to give watchdogs more freedom to scrutinise how £2bn in licence fee money is spent.  the public accounts committee called for the national audit office to be given a  free hand  to investigate how the bbc offers value for money. although six areas are to be opened up to scrutiny the audit office should have more power to choose what it investigated  the mps said. the call was made in a report into the bbc s freeview digital service.  our aim is not to rewrite the storyline of eastenders but simply to ensure that the bbc is as accountable to parliament as any other organisation spending public money   said the committee chairman  mp edward leigh.  the bbc s spending is not subject to the full independent scrutiny  and accountability to parliament.  parliament requires television owners to pay a licence fee and expects the comptroller and auditor general  on behalf of parliament  to be able to scrutinise how that money  over £2 billion a year  is used.   a bbc spokeswoman said:  we share the committee s interest in ensuring the public money we receive is spent well. though in its infancy  we think the arrangements with the nao are working well and should be given time to mature.  the report said the freeview digital service has had an  impressive  take up since its launch but the bbc must still dispel confusion about the service. the committee found the bbc had succeeded in ensuring subscription-free access to digital channels following the collapse of itv digital in 2002. but the fact that one in four homes could not access freeview remained a problem.  the report said that while gaps in the coverage were largely due to landscape issues  there was need for detailed explanations on the freeview website and on promotional literature as to why it was not available in specific areas. the government has proposed switch off of the analogue television signal  with 2012 the most recently proposed date. the bbc launched freeview in 2002 as an alternative to satellite subscription services such as sky  to allow its digital channels such as bbc three and news 24 to be seen. there have been an estimated five million freeview set-top boxes sold since the launch and prices have fallen considerably. the corporation plans to spend up to £138m on freeview before 2014 to ensure people can receive the service throughout the uk  and are aware of it.,bbc allow scrutini mp urg bbc give watchdog freedom scrutinis £bn licenc fee money spent public account committe call nation audit offic give free hand investig bbc offer valu money although six area open scrutini audit offic power choos investig mp say call make report bbc freeview digit servic aim rewrit storylin eastend simpli ensur bbc account parliament organis spend public money say committe chairman mp edward leigh bbc spend subject full independ scrutini account parliament parliament requir televis owner pay licenc fee expect comptrol auditor gener behalf parliament abl scrutinis money £ billion year use bbc spokeswoman say share committe interest ensur public money receiv spent well though infanc think arrang nao work well give time matur report say freeview digit servic impress take sinc launch bbc must still dispel confus servic committe found bbc succeed ensur subscriptionfre access digit channel follow collaps itv digit fact one four home could access freeview remain problem report say gap coverag larg due landscap issu need detail explan freeview websit promot literatur avail specif area govern propos switch analogu televis signal recent propos date bbc launch freeview altern satellit subscript servic sky allow digit channel bbc three news see estim five million freeview settop box sell sinc launch price fall consider corpor plan spend £m freeview ensur peopl receiv servic throughout uk awar

997,488,wolves appoint hoddle as manager glenn hoddle will be unveiled as the new wolves manager on tuesday.  the club have confirmed that the former england coach will be unveiled as the successor to dave jones at a news conference at molineux at 1100 gmt. hoddle has been linked with a return to former club southampton but wolves have won the race for his services. he has been out of the game since being sacked at spurs in september 2003 and worked alongside wolves caretaker boss stuart gray at southampton. hoddle began his managerial career as player-boss with swindon before moving on to chelsea and then taking up the england job.  his spell in charge of the national side came to an end after the 1998 world cup when he made controversial remarks about the disabled in a newspaper interview. the 47-year-old later returned to management with southampton  where he again succeeded jones - as he has now done at wolves. he engineered an upturn in saints  fortunes before being lured to white hart lane by tottenham - the club where he made his name as a player. that relationship turned sour at the start of the last campaign and he left the london club early last season. since then he has applied unsuccessfully for the post of france manager and had also been linked with a return to southampton. wolves are currently 17th in the championship and have a home game against millwall on tuesday.,wolv appoint hoddl manag glenn hoddl unveil new wolv manag tuesday club confirm former england coach unveil successor dave jone news confer molineux gmt hoddl link return former club southampton wolv race servic game sinc sack spur septemb work alongsid wolv caretak bos stuart gray southampton hoddl begin manageri career playerboss swindon move chelsea take england job spell charg nation side come end world cup make controversi remark disabl newspap interview yearold later return manag southampton succeed jone do wolv engin upturn saint fortun lure white hart lane tottenham club make name player relationship turn sour start last campaign left london club earli last season sinc appli unsuccess post franc manag also link return southampton wolv current th championship home game millwal tuesday
998,2157,dallaglio his own man to the end controversy and lawrence dallaglio have never been very far away from each other throughout a glittering international career.  even the end of his nine-year career came out of the blue  just four days before the start of the season. but then dallaglio has always been his own man. ever since emerging onto the international scene dallaglio has polarised opinions. to supporters of england  dallaglio could do no wrong. an integral part of a sustained period of success for england  dallaglio s crowning glory was his part in the side that won the rugby world cup in 2003.  rival fans  meanwhile  have tended to take an alternative view  seeing dallaglio as the epitome of the less agreeable characteristics of english rugby. never afraid to speak his mind  be it to the referee or the opposition on the pitch  or his coach or the media off it  dallaglio has sometimes rubbed people up the wrong way. dallaglio arrived as part of the unheralded england side which became the shock winners of the first rugby sevens world cup in 1993. it took him another two years to graduate to the full england xv  but once there he proved to the manor born. displaying maturity and physical power beyond his years  dallaglio rapidly established himself as an automatic choice able to play any one of the three back-row positions at international standard.  within two years of his debut  dallaglio was offered the england captain s band  and his career continued to go from strength to strength as he made the 1997 lions tour to south africa. although overlooked for the captaincy in favour of england team-mate martin johnson  he played a massive role in the 2-1 series victory. but after building up a seemingly unstoppable momentum  dallaglio s career hit the buffers at speed in 1999.  first came the last-minute defeat to wales in which dallaglio s decision not to kick for goal in the dying minutes was blamed for costing england a grand slam. worse was to follow though as an infamous newspaper sting cost him his treasured england captaincy. with sensational allegations of drug use - of which he was subsequently cleared - splashed across the front pages  a devastated dallaglio stepped down as england skipper. but he bounced back  getting his head down at club level before returning to the england fold  albeit now as a lieutenant to new captain johnson. as a member of a new-look england side on the long road to world cup glory - a journey not without mishaps as a succession of grand slams opportunities were spurned - dallaglio emerged as a key performer once again.  yet another setback arrived in 2001 as a serious knee injury cut short dallaglio s involvement on the lions tour to australia.  rumours began to circulate that his career was over but  in typical dallaglio style  he embarked on a punishing schedule of rehabilitation to return an even more fearsome physical specimen. one effect of the injury was to rob dallaglio of much of his pace  but ever the pragmatist  he reinvented himself as a close quarters number eight of the highest calibre.  the only player to play every minute of england s world cup triumph in australia  dallaglio could hardly have done more to secure england s historic win  and for that he will always be held in the highest esteem by england supporters. following johnson s retirement  dallaglio s career came full circle as woodward restored him as england captain. while england did not hit the heights in dallaglio s second spell as captain  losing five of their eight post-world cup tests  dallaglio led by example  leaving him as one of the few members of a squad lacking many world cup stars to live up to expectations. dallaglio walks away from the international game safe in the knowledge that he will go down as one of england s most accomplished players  if not one of the great captains despite his evident pride in leading his country.  the problem now for england is how to replace the almost irreplaceable. the likes of matt dawson  jonny wilkinson  phil vickery and hill have all been mentioned as contenders for dallaglio s role as captain. but it is as a player that england will really struggle to replace the 32-year-old. although players like joe worsley and chris jones are more than capable of stepping up  the fact that there is no stand-out candidate speaks volumes about dallaglio s massive influence on english rugby.,dallaglio man end controversi lawrenc dallaglio never far away throughout glitter intern career even end nineyear career come blue four day start season dallaglio alway man ever sinc emerg onto intern scene dallaglio polaris opinion support england dallaglio could wrong integr part sustain period success england dallaglio crown glori part side rugbi world cup rival fan meanwhil tend take altern view see dallaglio epitom less agreeabl characterist english rugbi never afraid speak mind refere opposit pitch coach medium dallaglio sometim rub peopl wrong way dallaglio arriv part unherald england side becam shock winner first rugbi seven world cup take anoth two year graduat full england xv prove manor born display matur physic power beyond year dallaglio rapidli establish automat choic abl play one three backrow posit intern standard within two year debut dallaglio offer england captain band career continu go strength strength make lion tour south africa although overlook captainci favour england teammat martin johnson play massiv role seri victori build seemingli unstopp momentum dallaglio career hit buffer speed first come lastminut defeat wale dallaglio decis kick goal die minut blame cost england grand slam wors follow though infam newspap sting cost treasur england captainci sensat alleg drug use subsequ clear splash across front page devast dallaglio step england skipper bounc back get head club level return england fold albeit lieuten new captain johnson member newlook england side long road world cup glori journey without mishap success grand slam opportun spurn dallaglio emerg key perform yet anoth setback arriv seriou knee injuri cut short dallaglio involv lion tour australia rumour begin circul career typic dallaglio style embark punish schedul rehabilit return even fearsom physic specimen one effect injuri rob dallaglio much pace ever pragmatist reinvent close quarter number eight high calibr player play everi minut england world cup triumph australia dallaglio could hardli do secur england histor win alway held high esteem england support follow johnson retir dallaglio career come full circl woodward restor england captain england hit height dallaglio second spell captain lose five eight postworld cup test dallaglio lead exampl leav one member squad lack mani world cup star live expect dallaglio walk away intern game safe knowledg go one england accomplish player one great captain despit evid pride lead countri problem england replac almost irreplac like matt dawson jonni wilkinson phil vickeri hill mention contend dallaglio role captain player england realli struggl replac yearold although player like joe worsley chri jone capabl step fact standout candid speak volum dallaglio massiv influenc english rugbi

1000,227,learning to love broadband we are reaching the point where broadband is a central part of daily life  at least for some  argues technology analyst bill thompson.  one of the nice things about being a writer is that i rarely have to go to an office to work. i can sit in a caf&#233; or a library  with or without a wi-fi connection  and research and write articles. if i am passing through kings cross station on my way to a meeting then i can log on from the platform. and i can spend the day working with my girlfriend anne  a children s writer  at her house in cambridge  sharing her wireless network. but just over a week ago i arrived at her house to find that there was no network connection.  we checked the cable modem and noticed that it had no power  and when she changed the power lead it sparked at her in a way which made it abundantly clear that it was never going to talk to the internet again. she called her service provider  and they told her it would be five days before an engineer would show up with a new cable modem. this did not seem too bad  but in fact she really suffered until her connection was restored on wednesday. with no modem installed in her computer  she had to borrow internet access from friends or use the dial-up connection on her daughter s laptop  so she had to choose between copying her files onto her usb memory card or accepting a slower and flakier net connection. as a result she did not submit the pictures she wanted to use for a book on earthquakes because they were too big to send over dial-up.  she could not research other material because she is used to having easy access to a fast link that lets her search quickly and effectively. but the impact spread into her personal life too. she did not take her children to the cinema during half-term because she could not find out which films were showing at the local cinemas. she planned a trip to norfolk but did not check the weather because the only place she knows to look for weather information is the bbc website. and she did not know where to go fossil-hunting on the trip because she could not type  fossils norfolk  into google. of course  she readily admits  she could have answered these questions if she had looked in the local paper  listened to the radio or found a book on fossils. but she did not  because having fast  always on  and easy access to the net has become part of the routine of her daily life  and when it was taken away it was too much effort to go back to the old ways of doing things. she may be unusual  but i do not think anne is alone.  according to ofcom there were almost four million broadband users in the uk in april 2004  and numbers are climbing fast. there will certainly be five million by the end of the year. dial-up users are switching to broadband. my dad finally made the change earlier this month and new net users are selecting broadband from the start. more and more of these broadband users are beginning to mould their daily lives around the availability of broadband internet connections  and they too will find it difficult to cope if they cannot get online for any reason.  it is part of the process of adaptation  and it is a vital step in the growth of broadband in the uk and elsewhere. people who have integrated net access into their daily lives tell their friends about it  and show off the cool stuff they can do. they encourage other people to get broadband so that they can share digital photos and do all of the other things that need fast and reliable connectivity. of course  broadband in the uk is laughably slow compared to other parts of the world. in south korea  japan and hong kong normal connection speeds are measured in megabits  or millions of bits  a second rather than the thousands that we are supposed to be happy with. but speed is only a small part of the attraction of broadband  and when it comes to checking websites for film times  looking at weather forecasts  or all of the other small things that make a real difference to the routines and habits of our daily lives  even uk speeds are sufficient. it may not be the brave new world of streaming full-screen video and superfast file downloads  but it will do for now. and it is certainly better than slow access or no access. just ask anne.  bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service

1004,1736,brown calls for £5.5bn aids fund gordon brown has called on rich nations to fund a £5.5bn ($10bn) plan to fight the aids epidemic and find a vaccine.  on the fourth day of his six-day tour of africa  the uk chancellor predicted a vaccine could be found by 2012 if the world stepped up its funding pledges. doubling the £400m being spent yearly on finding such a vaccine could advance it by three years and save six million lives  mr brown said on thursday. he hopes to use the uk s g8 presidency to push the issue forward.   i believe that the generation that provided the finance to combat  cure and eradicate the world s deadliest disease of today - and today the world s least curable disease - hiv/aids - will rightly earn the title  the great generation    mr brown said in a speech during his african tour. the problems of hiv/aids were inseparable from poverty  he added.  at least $10 billion per annum (£5.5bn) is needed to address the hiv/aids crisis in low and middle income countries.  existing financial commitments on their own will not stop the pandemic.  the uk s proposal for an international finance facility is so important - increasing world aid flows by over $50 billion (£27bn). a doubling of world aid to halve world poverty.  mr brown also said he had agreed with the italian finance minister domenico siniscalco to push forward with plans for the world-wide sharing and co-ordination of research into the disease.  currently the private sector was only spending £60m a year on seeking an inoculation and the market needed boosting  mr brown said. he called on industrialised nations to commit themselves to buying the first 300m vaccines at a cost of $20 each  thereby boosting the market for inoculations. this would be a  large enough inducement to create much stronger interest from both large and small pharmaceutical firms   mr brown added.  more must also be done to finance the treatment and care of those living with hiv/aids and their families  he said. but aid charity actionaid criticised mr brown s preoccupation with finding a vaccine and called on g8 nations to fund hiv/aids treatments. the charity s head of hiv/aids in britain  simon wright said:  while encouraging the pharmaceutical industry to discover an hiv vaccine is important  a failure to provide any funding for hiv treatments condemns a generation of people to death.  hiv is decimating african countries  killing the most productive adults who should be working  caring for children and building the economy. an hiv vaccine is probably at least 10 years away. treatments are needed now.  on wednesday  mr brown visited slums in the kenyan capital nairobi . he will visit an hiv/aids orphanage in tanzania and a women s credit union in mozambique before chairing a meeting of the commission for africa in cape town. the chancellor has already unveiled proposals for a g8 aid package which he has likened to the marshall plan used by the united states to rebuild europe after world war two.,brown call £bn aid fund gordon brown call rich nation fund £bn bn plan fight aid epidem find vaccin fourth day sixday tour africa uk chancellor predict vaccin could found world step fund pledg doubl £m spent yearli find vaccin could advanc three year save six million live mr brown say thursday hope use uk g presid push issu forward believ gener provid financ combat cure erad world deadliest diseas today today world least curabl diseas hivaid rightli earn titl great gener mr brown say speech african tour problem hivaid insepar poverti ad least billion per annum £bn need address hivaid crisi low middl incom countri exist financi commit stop pandem uk propos intern financ facil import increas world aid flow billion £bn doubl world aid halv world poverti mr brown also say agre italian financ minist domenico siniscalco push forward plan worldwid share coordin research diseas current privat sector spend £m year seek inocul market need boost mr brown say call industrialis nation commit buy first m vaccin cost therebi boost market inocul would larg enough induc creat much strong interest larg small pharmaceut firm mr brown ad must also do financ treatment care live hivaid famili say aid chariti actionaid criticis mr brown preoccup find vaccin call g nation fund hivaid treatment chariti head hivaid britain simon wright say encourag pharmaceut industri discov hiv vaccin import failur provid fund hiv treatment condemn gener peopl death hiv decim african countri kill product adult work care child build economi hiv vaccin probabl least year away treatment need wednesday mr brown visit slum kenyan capit nairobi visit hivaid orphanag tanzania woman credit union mozambiqu chair meet commiss africa cape town chancellor alreadi unveil propos g aid packag liken marshal plan use unit state rebuild europ world war two
1005,1058,yukos loses us bankruptcy battle a judge has dismissed an attempt by russian oil giant yukos to gain bankruptcy protection in the us.  yukos filed for chapter 11 protection in houston in an unsuccessful attempt to halt the auction of its yugansk division by the russian authorities. the court ruling is a blow to efforts to get damages for the sale of yugansk  which yukos claims was illegally sold. separately  former yukos boss mikhail khodorkovsky began testimony on friday in his trial for fraud and tax evasion.  mr khodorkovsky - who has been in jail for more than a year - pleaded not guilty to the charges brought against him and denied involvement in any criminal activities.  i pride myself on heading for 15 years a number of successful companies and helping other enterprises rise from their knees   he told a russian court.  yugansk was auctioned to help pay off $27.5bn (£14.5bn) in unpaid taxes. it was bought for $9.4bn by a previously-unknown group  which was in turn bought up almost immediately by state-controlled oil company rosneft.  texas judge letitia clark said yukos did not have enough of a us presence to establish us jurisdiction.  the vast majority of the business and financial activities of yukos continue to occur in russia   judge clark said in her ruling.  such activities require the continued participation of the russian government.  yukos had argued that a us court was entitled to declare it bankrupt before its yugansk unit was sold  since it has local bank accounts and its chief finance officer bruce misamore lives in houston. yukos claimed it sought help in the us because other forums - russian courts and the european court of human rights - were either unfriendly or offered less protection. russia had indicated it would in any case not abide by the rulings of the us courts.  in her ruling  the judge acknowledged that  it appears likely that agencies of the russian government have acted in a manner that would be considered confiscatory under united states law . but she said her role was simply to decide on jurisdiction. the us court s jurisdiction had been challenged by deutsche bank and gazpromneft  a former unit of russian gas monopoly gazprom which is due to merge with rosneft. analysts said the ability of gazprom and rosneft to trade freely overseas had been stifled while the ownership of yugansk remained unclear.  yukos said it would consider its options in light of the ruling. however  it claimed that the court had backed its argument in four out of five key issues.  we believe the merits of our case are strong and simple   said chief executive steven theede.  our assets were illegally seized. we want them back or damages paid.,yuko lose u bankruptci battl judg dismiss attempt russian oil giant yuko gain bankruptci protect u yuko file chapter protect houston unsuccess attempt halt auction yugansk divis russian author court rule blow effort get damag sale yugansk yuko claim illeg sell separ former yuko bos mikhail khodorkovski begin testimoni friday trial fraud tax evas mr khodorkovski jail year plead guilti charg brought deni involv crimin activ pride head year number success compani help enterpris rise knee told russian court yugansk auction help pay bn £bn unpaid tax bought bn previouslyunknown group turn bought almost immedi statecontrol oil compani rosneft texa judg letitia clark say yuko enough u presenc establish u jurisdict vast major busi financi activ yuko continu occur russia judg clark say rule activ requir continu particip russian govern yuko argu u court entitl declar bankrupt yugansk unit sell sinc local bank account chief financ offic bruce misamor live houston yuko claim sought help u forum russian court european court human right either unfriendli offer less protect russia indic would case abid rule u court rule judg acknowledg appear like agenc russian govern act manner would consid confiscatori unit state law say role simpli decid jurisdict u court jurisdict challeng deutsch bank gazpromneft former unit russian ga monopoli gazprom due merg rosneft analyst say abil gazprom rosneft trade freeli oversea stifl ownership yugansk remain unclear yuko say would consid option light rule howev claim court back argument four five key issu believ merit case strong simpl say chief execut steven theed asset illeg seiz want back damag paid

1008,339,aids and climate top davos agenda climate change and the fight against aids are leading the list of concerns for the first day of the world economic forum in the swiss resort of davos.  some 2 000 business and political leaders from around the globe will listen to uk prime minister tony blair s opening speech on wednesday. mr blair will focus on africa s development plans and global warming. earlier in the day came an update on efforts to have 3 million people on anti-aids drugs by the end of 2005. the world health organisation (who) said 700 000 people in poor countries were on life-extending drugs - up from 440 000 six months earlier but amounting to only 12% of the 5.8 million who needed them. a $2bn  funding gap  still stood in the way of hitting the 2005 target  the who said.  the themes to be stressed by mr blair - whose attendance was announced at the last minute - are those he wants to dominate the uk s chairmanship of the g8 group of industrialised states. other issues to be discussed at the five-day conference range from china s  economic power to iraq s future after this sunday s elections. aside from mr blair  more than 20 other world leaders are expected to attend including french president jacques chirac - due to speak by video link after bad weather delayed his helicopter - and south african president thabo mbeki  whose arrival has been delayed by ivory coast peace talks. the ukraine s new president  viktor yushchenko  will also be there - as will newly elected palestinian leader mahmoud abbas. showbiz figures will also put in an appearance  from u2 frontman bono - a well-known campaigner on trade and development issues - to angelina jolie  a goodwill campaigner for the un on refugees.  unlike previous years  protests against the wef are expected to be muted. anti-globalisation campaigners have called off a demonstration planned for the weekend. at the same time  about 100 000 people are expected to converge on the brazilian resort of porto alegre for the world social forum - the so-called  anti-davos  for campaigners against globalisation  for fair trade  and many other causes.  in contrast  the davos forum is dominated by business issues - from outsourcing to corporate leadership - with bosses of more than a fifth of the world s 500 largest companies scheduled to attend. a survey published on the eve of the conference by pricewaterhousecoopers said four in ten business leaders were  very confident  that their companies would see sales rise in 2005. asian and american executives  however  were much more confident than their european counterparts. but the political discussions  focusing on iran  iraq and china  are likely to dominate media attention.,aid climat top davo agenda climat chang fight aid lead list concern first day world econom forum swiss resort davo busi polit leader around globe listen uk prime minist toni blair open speech wednesday mr blair focu africa develop plan global warm earlier day come updat effort million peopl antiaid drug end world health organis say peopl poor countri lifeextend drug six month earlier amount million need bn fund gap still stood way hit target say theme stress mr blair whose attend announc last minut want domin uk chairmanship g group industrialis state issu discus fiveday confer rang china econom power iraq futur sunday elect asid mr blair world leader expect attend includ french presid jacqu chirac due speak video link bad weather delay helicopt south african presid thabo mbeki whose arriv delay ivori coast peac talk ukrain new presid viktor yushchenko also newli elect palestinian leader mahmoud abba showbiz figur also put appear u frontman bono wellknown campaign trade develop issu angelina joli goodwil campaign un refuge unlik previou year protest wef expect mute antiglobalis campaign call demonstr plan weekend time peopl expect converg brazilian resort porto alegr world social forum socal antidavo campaign globalis fair trade mani caus contrast davo forum domin busi issu outsourc corpor leadership bos fifth world large compani schedul attend survey publish eve confer pricewaterhousecoop say four ten busi leader confid compani would see sale rise asian american execut howev much confid european counterpart polit discus focus iran iraq china like domin medium attent

1012,1455,can yahoo dominate next decade  yahoo has reached the grand old age of 10 and  in internet years  that is a long time.  for many  yahoo remains synonymous with the internet - a veteran that managed to ride the dot-com wave and the subsequent crash and maintain itself as one of the web s top brands. but for others there is another  newer net icon threatening to overshadow yahoo in the post dot-com world - google.  the veteran and the upstart have plenty in common - yahoo was the first internet firm to offer initial public shares and google was arguably the most watched ipo (initial public offering) of the post-dot-com era. both began life as search engines although in 2000  when yahoo chose google to power its search facility while it concentrated on its web portal business  it was very much yahoo that commanded press attention. in recent years  the column inches have stacked up in google s favour as the search engine also diversifies with the launch of services such as gmail  its shopping channel froogle and google news.  for jupiter analyst olivier beauvillain  yahoo s initial decision to put its investment on search on hold was an error.  yahoo was busy building a portal and while it was good to diversify they made a big mistake in outsourcing search to google   he said  they thought google would just be a technology provider but it has become a portal in its own right and a direct competitor   he added. he believes yahoo failed to see how crucial search would become to internet users  something it has rediscovered in recent years.  it is interesting that in these last few years  it has refocused on search following the success of google   he said. but for allen weiner  a research director at analyst firm gartner and someone who has followed yahoo s progress since the early years  the future of search is not going to be purely about the technology powering it.  search technology is valuable but the next generation of search is going to be about premium content and the interface that users have to that content   he said. he believes the rivalry between google and yahoo is overblown and instead thinks the real battle is going to be between yahoo and msn. it is a battle that yahoo is currently winning  he believes.  microsoft has amazing assets including software capability and a global name but it has yet to show me it can create a rival product to yahoo   he said.  he is convinced yahoo remains the single most important brand on the world wide web.   i believe yahoo is the seminal brand on the web. if you are looking for a text book definition of web portal then yahoo is it   he said. it has achieved this dominance  mr weiner believes  by a canny combination of acquisitions such as that of inktomi and overture  and by avoiding direct involvement in either content creation or internet access. that is not to say that yahoo hasn t had its dark days. when the dot-com bubble burst  it lost one-third of its revenue in a single year  bore a succession of losses and saw its market value fall from a peak of $120bn to $4.6bn at one point. crucial to its survival was the decision to replace chief executive tim koogle with terry semel in may 2001  thinks mr weiner. his business savvy  coupled with the technical genius of founder jerry yang has proved a winning combination  he says.  so as the internet giant emerges from its first decade as a survivor  how will it fare as it enters its teenage years   the game is theirs to lose and msn is the only one that stands in the way of yahoo s domination   predicted mr weiner. nick hazel  yahoo s head of consumer services in the uk  thinks the fact that yahoo has grown up with the first wave of the internet generation will stand it in good stead. search will be a key focus as will making yahoo messenger available on mobiles  forging new broadband partnerships such as that with bt in the uk and continuing to provide a range of services beyond the desktop  he says. mr weiner thinks yahoo s vision of becoming the ultimate gateway to the web will move increasing towards movies and television as more and more people get broadband access.  it will spread its portal wings to expand into rich media   he predicts.,yahoo domin next decad yahoo reach grand old age internet year long time mani yahoo remain synonym internet veteran manag ride dotcom wave subsequ crash

1013,1911,hospital suspends  no welsh  plan an english hospital has suspended plans to stop treating welsh patients who have waited more than three months.  hereford county hospital had earlier said that from the new year patients waiting longer than this would be taken off waiting lists for hip and knee operations. gps in wales had feared patients could be pushed to the back of another queue. but after talks with powys health board the hospital called off its plan until health chiefs meet early in january. hereford hospital trust caused an outcry when it sent out a letter telling patients that for financial and administrative reasons it planned to turn down some orthopaedic patients. shocked health officials in powys said this meant they would be left with the prospect of patients and doctors having to find new appointments in other hospitals. andy williams  chief executive of powys local health board  had said it was  a totally unacceptable way to behave .  mr williams had said he did not think it was a welsh-english issue  but said hereford hospital was  struggling financially and trying to pass the problem back to powys . he had told bbc radio wales:  i have written straight back to the trust... to insist they withdraw this threat and treat the patients i am paying them to treat.  but after the hospital had agreed to the suspension  mr williams said he was optimistic a compromise could be reached which would ensure welsh patients continued to be treated there. he said the problem had been caused by the difference in waiting time targets between england and wales.  the target is 12 months for welsh patients  but just three months in england. the contract with the powys health board was worth £7m a year for the hospital and accounts for 12% of its patients. in a statement before the suspension of the idea  the welsh assembly government said the situation was  unacceptable .  but powys local health board is committed to ensuring our patients receive the care that is appropriate   said the assembly government.  although we will be challenging hereford s decision we will put in place appropriate care for our patients. they will be contacted by their gps in the next week.  earlier  david rose  chief executive of hereford hospitals nhs trust  had said:  it is with real regret that we have taken this step.  we want to continue providing an excellent and fast service to powys people but can only do this if we are paid to provide the service.  in 2005 our waiting time will fall to a maximum of 6-months and we want powys people to ask to be referred to our modern hospital.  we appeal to powys local health board to allow powys people to choose hereford for their treatment.,hospit suspend welsh plan english hospit suspend plan stop treat welsh patient wait three month hereford counti hospit earlier say new year patient wait longer would take wait list hip knee oper gp wale fear patient could push back anoth queue talk powi health board hospit call plan health chief meet earli januari hereford hospit trust caus outcri sent letter tell patient financi administr reason plan turn orthopaed patient shock health offici powi say meant would left prospect patient doctor find new appoint hospit andi william chief execut powi local health board say total unaccept way behav mr william say think welshenglish issu say hereford hospit struggl financi tri pas problem back powi told bbc radio wale write straight back trust insist withdraw threat treat patient pay treat hospit agre suspens mr william say optimist compromis could reach would ensur welsh patient continu treat say problem caus differ wait time target england wale target month welsh patient three month england contract powi health board worth £m year hospit account patient statement suspens idea welsh assembl govern say situat unaccept powi local health board commit ensur patient receiv care appropri say assembl govern although challeng hereford decis put place appropri care patient contact gp next week earlier david rise chief execut hereford hospit nh trust say real regret take step want continu provid excel fast servic powi peopl paid provid servic wait time fall maximum month want powi peopl ask refer modern hospit appeal powi local health board allow powi peopl choos hereford treatment

1017,707,ireland 21-19 argentina an injury-time dropped goal by ronan o gara stole victory for ireland from underneath the noses of argentina at lansdowne road on saturday.  o gara kicked all of ireland s points  with two dropped goals and five penalties  to give the home side a 100% record in their autumn internationals. an impressive argentina appeared in control until the dying seconds. the pumas shocked the irish early on with a try from federico aramburu  and felipe contepomi kicked 14 points. the well-drilled and sharper pumas out-played and out-thought ireland in the early stages. indiscipline allowed argentina s leinster fly-half contepomi to open the scoring in the third minute with a straightforward penalty. he was on the mark again two minutes later when argentina shocked a ragged ireland with the first try of the game. ireland turned the ball over and manuel contepomi broke through an unstructured defence before feeding his midfield partner aramburu to sprint in under the posts. o gara finally got ireland on the board with a dropped goal in the ninth minute only for contepomi to rifle over his second penalty two minutes later. playing into a strong wind and rain  ireland continued to come second best in tight situations  and turnovers began to mount up against a rugged defence. o gara managed to land his second penalty in the 36th minute  but once again contepomi replied in kind four minutes into first-half injury time. the second-half started as the first had ended. o gara rifled over another penalty in the 45th minute  but contepomi matched it three minutes later. the upper-body strength of the pumas never allowed ireland to take control up front  while the three-quarters had no space to manoeuvre. ireland had to rely on o gara s boot to keep in touch rather than any contrived running plays. the munsterman landed two more penalties - one of them from 48 metres - to bring his team to within four points with 13 minutes on the clock remaining. and ireland s chance came when argentina s number eight gonzalo longo was yellow carded with six minutes to go for an offence in the line-out. o gara made no mistake as he rifled over his fifth penalty to set up a tense final few minutes. but ireland showed great composure to get themselves into a position to allow o gara to thump over a massive drop goal to complete a tremendous  if fortuitous  comeback.,ireland argentina injurytim drop goal ronan gara stole victori ireland underneath nose argentina lansdown road saturday gara kick ireland point two drop goal five penalti give home side record autumn intern impress argentina appear control die second puma shock irish earli tri federico aramburu felip contepomi kick point welldril sharper puma outplay outthought ireland earli stage indisciplin allow argentina leinster flyhalf contepomi open score third minut straightforward penalti mark two minut later argentina shock rag ireland first tri game ireland turn ball manuel contepomi broke unstructur defenc feed midfield partner aramburu sprint post gara final get ireland board drop goal ninth minut contepomi rifl second penalti two minut later play strong wind rain ireland continu come second best tight situat turnov begin mount rug defenc gara manag land second penalti th minut contepomi repli kind four minut firsthalf injuri time secondhalf start first end gara rifl anoth penalti th minut contepomi match three minut later upperbodi strength puma never allow ireland take control front threequart space manoeuvr ireland reli gara boot keep touch rather contriv run play munsterman land two penalti one metr bring team within four point minut clock remain ireland chanc come argentina number eight gonzalo longo yellow card six minut go offenc lineout gara make mistak rifl fifth penalti set ten final minut ireland show great composur get posit allow gara thump massiv drop goal complet tremend fortuit comeback
1018,1377,ec calls truce in deficit battle the european commission (ec) has called a truce in its battle with france and germany over breaching deficit limits.  the move came after france and germany vowed to run their budget deficits below the eu cap in 2005 - for the first time in four years. but  the ec did warn the two were under close scrutiny and it would act if their fiscal situations deteriorated. under eu rules  member countries must keep their deficits below 3%. france and germany will breach that this year. it will be the third year in a row that the two countries have broken the european union s stability and growth pact rules.  the eurozone s two biggest economies left the pact in tatters in november 2003 when they persuaded fellow eu members to put the threat of penalties for deficit breaches on hold.  the commission then took the pair to the european court of human justice - which ruled eu countries could not put the pact  in abeyance   and confirmed the ec s right to launch  excessive debt procedures . after announcing its decision to erase france and germany from its list of deficit rule breakers  the eu said that the time lag created by the ruling meant that 2005 should be the target year for the pair to bring their budget s below 3%.  the commission concludes that the two countries appear to be on track to correct their excessive deficits by 2005   it said in a statement. the eu expects the german deficit to fall to fall to 2.9% of gdp next year from 3.9% this year  while france s is forecast to drop to 3% from an expected 3.7% this year. the forecasts are based on ec predictions of gdp growth of 1.5% in germany next year and 2.2% in france.  berlin welcomed the decision  with finance minister hans eichel saying it showed that the ec recognised germany s fiscal policy was  on the right track even amid very difficult economic conditions . however paris was more subdued  with finance minister herve gaymard telling parliament:  we must continue along this path of saving money.  however  the move still had its critics  with the european people s party (epp) attacking the ec for backing down from punitive action.  the commission is buckling under the pressure from germany and france    epp spokesman alexander radwan said.  the scary fact is that budget sinners  despite having repeatedly exceeded the 3% deficit limit  do not have to fear any sanctions.  despite the commission delivering its decision on the two biggest eurozone economies  it refused to comment on similar action against greece which has also broken the 3% deficit ceiling. monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said that it was a matter for next week.,ec call truce deficit battl european commiss ec call truce battl franc germani breach deficit limit move come franc germani vow run budget deficit eu cap first time four year ec warn two close scrutini would act fiscal situat deterior eu rule member countri must keep deficit franc germani breach year third year row two countri broken european union stabil growth pact rule eurozon two big economi left pact tatter novemb persuad fellow eu member put threat penalti deficit breach hold commiss take pair european court human justic rule eu countri could put pact abey confirm ec right launch excess debt procedur announc decis era franc germani list deficit rule breaker eu say time lag creat rule meant target year pair bring budget commiss conclud two countri appear track correct excess deficit say statement eu expect german deficit fall fall gdp next year year franc forecast drop expect year forecast base ec predict gdp growth germani next year franc berlin welcom decis financ minist han eichel say show ec recognis germani fiscal polici right track even amid difficult econom condit howev pari subdu financ minist herv gaymard tell parliament must continu along path save money howev move still critic european peopl parti epp attack ec back punit action commiss buckl pressur germani franc epp spokesman alexand radwan say scari fact budget sinner despit repeatedli exceed deficit limit fear sanction despit commiss deliv decis two big eurozon economi refus comment similar action greec also broken deficit ceil monetari affair commission joaquin almunia say matter next week
1019,2075,apple sues  tiger  file sharers apple has taken more legal action to stop online leaks of its new products.  the computer giant has sued three men for releasing preview versions of its latest mac osx software onto file-sharing sites prior to its release. it said two versions of the operating system  codenamed tiger  were put onto the net in october and december. it is the second time in two weeks apple has taken legal action to protect its future products. tiger is due to be shipped in early 2005. last week  it filed a lawsuit against  unnamed individuals  who leaked details about new products onto the web.  the latest action was against members of the apple developer connection  a group of programmers which gets to see test versions of upcoming software so they can develop or change their own programs to work with them.  members of apple developer connection receive advance copies of apple software under strict confidentiality agreements  which we take very seriously to protect our intellectual property   apple said in a statement.  it added that its future financial results were very much dependent on developing and improving its operating systems and other software. it is thought the men used sites which employ bittorrent technology. with bittorrent technology  sites do not host actual files being shared  instead they host a link that points people to others that have the particular file. last week  the motion picture association of america launched a legal campaign targeting websites that operate using the bittorrent system in an effort to clamp down on movie piracy. apple is no stranger to taking legal action against those who leak product information. in december 2002  it sued a former contractor who allegedly put drawings  images and engineering details of its powermac g4 computer online. the latest action was filed on monday in the us district court in california. it comes just weeks before the macworld conference in san francisco  used to showcase new products.,appl sue tiger file sharer appl take legal action stop onlin leak new product comput giant su three men releas preview version late mac osx softwar onto fileshar site prior releas say two version oper system codenam tiger put onto net octob decemb second time two week appl take legal action protect futur product tiger due ship earli last week file lawsuit unnam individu leak detail new product onto web late action member appl develop connect group programm get see test version upcom softwar develop chang program work member appl develop connect receiv advanc copi appl softwar strict confidenti agreement take serious protect intellectu properti appl say statement ad futur financi result much depend develop improv oper system softwar thought men use site employ bittorr technolog bittorr technolog site host actual file share instead host link point peopl other particular file last week motion pictur associ america launch legal campaign target websit oper use bittorr system effort clamp movi piraci appl stranger take legal action leak product inform decemb su former contractor allegedli put draw imag engin detail powermac g comput onlin late action file monday u district court california come week macworld confer san francisco use showcas new product

1021,987,video phone help for deaf people deaf people who prefer to communicate using british sign language (bsl) could soon be having their phone conversations relayed using webcams or videophones and an interpreter.  the video relay service is being piloted by the royal national institute for deaf people (rnid)  but the organisation says unless the service is provided at the same rate as voice calls it will be beyond most people s pockets. the rnid is urging telecoms regulator  ofcom  to reduce the cost of the service from the current £7.00 per minute and make it the same as ordinary phone calls. the service works by putting a deaf person in visual contact with a bsl interpreter via a webcam or video phone  and the interpreter then relays the deaf person s conversation using a telephone and translates the other person s response into sign language.  for many deaf people  especially those born deaf  bsl is a first and preferred means of communication.  until now  the only alternative has been to use textphones which means having to type a message and have it relayed via an operator.  in the past  i ve used textphones but they have problems   said robert currington who is taking part in the pilot.  i communicate in bsl; my written english is not very good and it takes me longer to think in english and type my message.   i sometimes find it difficult to understand the reply.  the rnid says the uk is lagging behind other countries which are already making relay services available at the cost of an ordinary phone call.  there are no technical or economic reasons for not providing equivalent access to services for deaf people   said rnid technology director  guido gybels.  in the us and australia  sign language relay services have already been made universally available at the same cost as a voice call.  by failing to provide and fund the video relay service for sign language users  the telecommunications sector is effectively discriminating against an already disenfranchised group.   ofcom says it has plans to review the services that telecoms companies are obliged to provide early next year. and new technology  including the video relay service  will be discussed with interested parties in the near future. but a spokesman said its powers were limited by legislation.  any proposals to extend existing arrangements to cover new services would be for government to consider   he said. mr currington  like many of the uk s 70 000 bsl users  will be hoping that a way can be found to make a cost-effective service available.  the relay service makes phone conversations a pleasure   he said.  i can show my emotions more easily in bsl in the same way hearing people express emotions through voice calls.,video phone help deaf peopl deaf peopl prefer commun use british sign languag bsl could soon phone convers relay use webcam videophon interpret video relay servic pilot royal nation institut deaf peopl rnid organis say unless servic provid rate voic call beyond peopl pocket rnid urg telecom regul ofcom reduc cost servic current £ per minut make ordinari phone call servic work put deaf person visual contact bsl interpret via webcam video phone interpret relay deaf person convers use telephon translat person respons sign languag mani deaf peopl especi born deaf bsl first prefer mean commun altern use textphon mean type messag relay via oper past use textphon problem say robert currington take part pilot commun bsl write english good take longer think english type messag sometim find difficult understand repli rnid say uk lag behind countri alreadi make relay servic avail cost ordinari phone call technic econom reason provid equival access servic deaf peopl say rnid technolog director guido gybel u australia sign languag relay servic alreadi make univers avail cost voic call fail provid fund video relay servic sign languag user telecommun sector effect discrimin alreadi disenfranchis group ofcom say plan review servic telecom compani oblig provid earli next year new technolog includ video relay servic discus interest parti near futur spokesman say power limit legisl propos extend exist arrang cover new servic would govern consid say mr currington like mani uk bsl user hope way found make costeffect servic avail relay servic make phone convers pleasur say show emot easili bsl way hear peopl express emot voic call
1022,2179,hollywood ready for oscars night hollywood is preparing for the biggest night in the film world s calendar  the 77th academy awards  on sunday.  a host of stars are expected to grace the red carpet outside los angeles  kodak theatre  including johnny depp  cate blanchett and leonardo dicaprio. british actors in attendance include nominees clive owen  imelda staunton  kate winslet and director mike leigh. the aviator leads the shortlist  but critics believe the night may belong to clint eastwood s million dollar baby. a recent poll of us pundits found eastwood s boxing drama had become the new favourite to win best film over the howard hughes biopic.  if the 74-year-old does win  he will become the oldest person ever to be named best director at the ceremony. uk critics still favour the aviator for best film  but believe the best director title will generate a close fought battle between eastwood and martin scorsese.  scorsese has never won the best director prize  despite four previous nominations for films including raging bull  goodfellas and gangs of new york. eastwood has won best director once before  for unforgiven in 1993. most experts predict the twice-nominated jamie foxx will win best actor for his portrayal of singer ray charles  while vera drake star imelda staunton looks likely to lose out in the best actress field to hilary swank in million dollar baby. the uk s highest hopes remain with clive owen  who has scooped both the golden globe and the bafta for his supporting role in closer. actor and comedian chris rock will host the event  which will be broadcast with a seven-second time delay to allow censors to cut out any unsuitable content.   we have the bleep machine ready  but bleeps will be used as needed   producer gil cates told reporters. however  he added that he strongly disapproved of the growing tendency to censor live broadcasts on us tv.  he also played down fears that rock  who is known for using strong language in his stand-up routines  might cause controversy on the night. the 40-year-old comic has already promised not to swear live on air during the show.  chris has a sense of humour and everything he says is really said humorously   cates said.  you need a movie star and someone who is a stand-up comic so they can deal with the vicissitudes of the show.  security will also be tight  with police employing a system to detect sarin nerve gas.  we are pulling out all the stops   said john miller  chief of counterterrorism at the los angeles police department. the show is  a symbol of american culture and has the potential to be a high-visibility target   he added. meanwhile  organisers have erected a canopy over the red carpet following an outbreak of torrential rain in los angeles over the past week. cates said the covers would be removed if the threat of wet weather receded. details have also emerged of the contents of this year s gift bags  which are given to nominees and presenters on the night. this year s bags will include a gift certificate for a luxury beach resort  a pair of mink eyelashes and a kitchen set with a year s supply of tea and coffee. the event will be televised by the abc network from 1700 local time (0100 gmt)  and on sky movies in the uk from 0130 gmt.,hollywood readi oscar night hollywood prepar big night film world calendar th academi

1024,316,white prepared for battle tough-scrummaging prop julian white is expecting a resurgent wales to give him a rough ride in england s six nations opener in cardiff on saturday.  the leicester tight-head is in the form of his life  making the england number three shirt his own. but he knows wales will put his technique under immense scrutiny.  the welsh scrum is a force to be reckoned with   he told bbc sport.  they have made a lot of changes for the better over the last few years.  white is also impressed with the welsh pack s strength in depth.  gethin jenkins is starting at loose-head for them. he has played a bit at tight-head but i think his favoured position is loose-head and he is very good   he added. the 31-year-old has made a massive contribution to the england and leicester cause of late and is arguably the form tight-head prop in the world.  he destroyed south africa s os du randt in the scrum at twickenham last autumn to give england the platform for an impressive 32-16 victory. leicester  who signed white from bristol when the west country side were relegated from the zurich premiership in the summer of 2003  have also been aided by white s presence this season. the tigers are sitting pretty at the top of the premiership table and have also booked their place in the last eight of the heineken cup.  i am pleased with my form   he said.  but my form is helped by the people i play with at leicester - people like martin johnson and graham rowntree.  it s been a good season so far and to be in the starting xv for the first game of the six nations is what every player wants.  i am delighted with the way things have gone but we have to get it right this weekend.  white is now one of the more experienced members of the england squad which takes to the field on saturday. injuries have taken their toll and coach andy robinson has been deprived of richard hill  jonny wilkinson  martin corry  mike tindall  will greenwood and stuart abbott.  and with 27 caps and a world cup winner s medal to his name  white is now in a position to offer his experience to youngsters such as centres matthew tait and jamie noon.  i don t know how much experience a tight-head can give a centre but you are there to give them a pat on the back if things go wrong or to be there if they want to talk in any way   he added.  when i first came into the squad  people like jason leonard and martin johnson were the first to come over and talk through things and help out.   it gives you a lot of confidence when people like that speak to you.  i was in awe of a lot of them so to sit down and speak with them and realise you are on the same wavelength is good.  white missed the vast majority of last year s six nations because of a knee injury and is raring for the 2005 event to get going. and that is despite the opening game taking place amid the red-hot atmosphere in cardiff.  i enjoy the atmosphere. the millennium stadium is probably one of the best stadiums in the world   he said.  to go down there and hear the shouting and the singing - it s one of my favourite places to play.  this is probably the most even six nations for a long time. england  ireland  france and wales are all contenders.  on form  ireland should be favourites but you just don t know -

1027,1238,worldcom director ends evidence the former chief financial officer at us telecoms firm worldcom has finished giving evidence at the trial of his ex-boss bernie ebbers.  scott sullivan admitted to jurors he was willing to commit fraud to meet wall street earnings projections. mr ebbers is on trial for fraud and conspiracy in relation to worldcom s collapse in 2002. he pleads not guilty. mr sullivan has spent two days being cross-examined by lawyers for former worldcom chief executive mr ebbers.  attorney reid weingarten has attempted to portray mr sullivan as a liar and on thursday quizzed him about his decision to commit fraud to meet analysts  profit estimates.  at that point in time   mr sullivan said  referring to the first false entries in late 2000   i knew it was wrong and i knew it was against the law  but i thought we would get through it in the short term.  mr sullivan  42  has already pleaded guilty to fraud and will be sentenced following mr ebbers  trial  where he is appearing as a prosecution witness. mr ebbers  63  has always insisted that he was unaware of any hidden shortfalls in worldcom s finances. the former finance officer said mr ebbers knew about the improper accounting entries that were made between 2000 and 2002 to conceal soaring expenses and inflate revenue.  mr ebbers could face a sentence of 85 years if convicted of all the charges he is facing. worldcom s problems appear to have begun with the collapse of the dotcom boom which cut its business from internet companies. prosecutors allege that the company s top executives responded by orchestrating massive fraud over a two-year period. worldcom emerged from bankruptcy protection in 2004  and is now known as mci. on monday  mci agreed to a buyout by verizon communications in a deal valued at $6.75bn.,worldcom director end evid former chief financi offic u telecom firm worldcom finish give evid trial exboss berni ebber scott sullivan admit juror will commit fraud meet wall street earn project mr ebber trial fraud conspiraci relat worldcom collaps plead guilti mr sullivan spent two day crossexamin lawyer former worldcom chief execut mr ebber attorney reid weingarten attempt portray mr sullivan liar thursday quizz decis commit fraud meet analyst profit estim point time mr sullivan say refer first fals entri late knew wrong knew law thought would get short term mr sullivan alreadi plead guilti fraud sentenc follow mr ebber trial appear prosecut wit mr ebber alway insist unawar hidden shortfal worldcom financ former financ offic say mr ebber knew improp account entri make conceal soar expens inflat revenu mr ebber could face sentenc year convict charg face worldcom problem appear begin collaps dotcom boom cut busi internet compani prosecutor alleg compani top execut respond orchestr massiv fraud twoyear period worldcom emerg bankruptci protect know mci monday mci agre buyout verizon commun deal valu bn
1028,2199,asian banks halt dollar s slide the dollar regained some lost ground against most major currencies on wednesday after south korea and japan denied they were planning a sell-off.  the dollar suffered its biggest one-day fall in four months on tuesday on fears that asian central banks were about to lower their reserves of dollars. japan is the biggest holder of dollar reserves in the world  with south korea the fourth largest. the dollar was buying 104.76 yen at 0950 gmt  0.5% stronger on the day. it also edged higher against both the euro and the pound  with one euro worth $1.3218  and one pound buying $1.9094. concerns over rising oil prices and the outlook for the dollar pushed down us stock markets on tuesday; the dow jones industrial average closed down 1.6%  while the nasdaq lost 1.3%.  the dollar s latest slide began after a south korean parliamentary report suggested the country  which has about $200bn in foreign reserves  had plans to boost holdings of currencies such as the australian and canadian dollar. on wednesday  however  south korea moved to steady the financial markets. it issued a statement that  the bank of korea will not change the portfolio of currencies in its reserves due to short term market factors . japan  too  steadied nerves. a senior japanese finance ministry official told reuters  we have no plans to change the composition of currency holdings in the foreign reserves  and we are not thinking about expanding our euro holdings . japan has $850bn in foreign exchange reserves. at the start of the year  the us currency  which had lost 7% against the euro in the final three months of 2004 and had fallen to record lows  staged something of a recovery. analysts  however  pointed to the dollar s inability recently to extend that rally despite positive economic and corporate data  and highlighted the fact that many of the us s economic problems had not disappeared. the focus has been on the country s massive trade and budget deficits  and analysts have predicted more dollar weakness to come.,asian bank halt dollar slide dollar regain lose ground major currenc wednesday south korea japan deni plan selloff dollar suffer big oneday fall four month tuesday fear asian central bank low reserv dollar japan big holder dollar reserv world south korea fourth large dollar buy yen gmt strong day also edg high euro pound one euro worth one pound buy concern rise oil price outlook dollar push u stock market tuesday dow jone industri averag close nasdaq lose dollar late slide begin south korean parliamentari report suggest countri bn foreign reserv plan boost hold currenc australian canadian dollar wednesday howev south korea move steadi financi market issu statement bank korea chang portfolio currenc reserv due short term market factor japan steadi nerv senior japanes financ ministri offici told reuter plan chang composit currenc hold foreign reserv think expand euro hold japan bn foreign exchang reserv start year u currenc lose euro final three month fall record low stage someth recoveri analyst howev point dollar inabl recent extend ralli despit posit econom corpor data highlight fact mani u econom problem disappear focu countri massiv trade budget deficit analyst predict dollar weak come

1030,1550,how to make a greener computer the hi-tech industry is starting to get more environmentally aware. bill thompson thinks it s about time.  my first car ran on four star petrol and pumped vast quantities of lead into the atmosphere as i drove around cambridge. now you can t buy petrol with lead additives  and we re all better off as a result. chip giant intel recently began shipping computer circuit boards that are lead free too  reflecting a growing awareness on the part of the technology industry that products have to be designed and built in more environmentally friendly ways.  apart from reducing the use of toxic materials like arsenic  mercury  cadmium and other heavy metals in the products themselves  the manufacturing process is also being cleaned up  with fewer complex and potentially damaging organic chemicals used as solvents. and work is going into making power supplies that are more energy efficient  since current transformers are astonishingly wasteful as they charge our laptops  mobiles and music players.  one of the key aspects of the new approach is to design products that are easier to recycle. if you have got a phone or a computer with toxic chemicals or heavy metals in it then extracting them can be tricky and expensive. a well-designed electronic component is able to be recycled at low cost. this is going to be very important to hardware manufacturers in europe since from august the new waste electronic and electrical equipment directive will oblige them to accept returned products for recycling.  they will end up paying if they build things that are expensive or impossible to take apart and will find their profits hit  something which is likely to motivate them where appeals to the wider public interest might fall on deaf ears. it is  as they say  about time. we have a long and depressing history of developing new technologies with complete disregard for their potential impact on the environment  and waiting until there is a crisis looming before we try to redesign them to cause less damage. the car engine is a case in point: lead additives helped stop petrol vapour exploding too early in the cylinder  a phenomenon called  knocking   so they were simply used without any real thought for the fact that the lead would end up in the atmosphere. redesigning engines and making petrol slightly different was a lot more work  so it took decades before it was done. we re seeing the same thing in the technology industry and  as a result  there are billions of devices  from old mobile phones to antique handhelds  that will have to be recycled in years to come. if apple gets its way then a lot of people are going to be buying a new mac mini and throwing away their old pc  keeping the monitor and other peripherals.  even if apple does not get its way  four or five-year-old computers are not good enough to run modern programs and it s not unreasonable to replace them. but what do we do with the old ones   i ve just looked around my office and i find two monitors  an old 386 pc  two old handhelds  three ancient laptops  four antique mobile phones  a collection of rechargeable batteries and even a sun workstation that is no longer really much use. they are all old enough to be hazardous waste - the monitors alone will be full of arsenic and lead - but it s possible that some of the components could be useful. i could take them up the to the council recycling centre  but it s a 10-mile drive away across town  and like many other people my commitment to recycling is shallow at best. here in cambridge we have green bins for compostable waste  a box for glass  cans and paper that can be recycled  and a black bin for the rest. there are bottle banks and clothing banks scattered around town and in supermarket car parks. would it be too much to ask for an electronics recycling box too  i d probably remember to take my old mobile with me to the supermarket and drop it in a box - at least eventually.  bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital.,make greener comput hitech industri start get environment awar bill thompson think time first car ran four star petrol pump vast quantiti lead atmospher drove around cambridg buy petrol lead addit well result chip giant intel recent begin ship comput circuit board lead free reflect grow awar part technolog industri product design built environment friendli way apart reduc use toxic materi like arsen mercuri cadmium heavi metal product manufactur process also clean few complex potenti damag organ chemic use solvent work go make power suppli energi effici sinc current transform astonishingli wast charg laptop mobil music player one key aspect new approach design product easy recycl get phone comput toxic chemic heavi metal extract tricki expens welldesign electron compon abl recycl low cost go import hardwar manufactur europ sinc august new wast electron electr equip direct oblig accept return product recycl end pay build thing expens imposs take apart find profit hit someth like motiv appeal wider public interest might fall deaf ear say time long depress histori develop new technolog complet disregard potenti impact environ wait crisi loom tri redesign caus less damag car engin case point lead addit help stop petrol vapour explod earli cylind phenomenon call knock simpli use without real thought fact lead would end atmospher redesign engin make petrol slightli differ lot work take decad do see thing technolog industri result billion devic old mobil phone antiqu handheld recycl year come appl get way lot peopl go buy new mac mini throw away old pc keep monitor peripher even appl get way four fiveyearold comput good enough run modern program unreason replac old one look around offic find two monitor old pc two old handheld three ancient laptop four antiqu mobil phone collect recharg batteri even sun workstat longer realli much use old enough hazard wast monitor alon full arsen lead possibl compon could use could take council recycl centr mile drive away across town like mani peopl commit recycl shallow best cambridg green bin compost wast box glass can paper recycl black bin rest bottl bank cloth bank scatter around town supermarket car park would much ask electron recycl box probabl rememb take old mobil supermarket drop box least eventu bill thompson regular comment bbc world servic programm go digit

1033,607,court mulls file-sharing future judges at the us supreme court have been hearing evidence for and against file-sharing networks.  the court will decide whether producers of file-sharing software can ultimately be held responsible for copyright infringement. they questioned if opening the way for the entertainment industry to sue file-sharers could deter innovation. they also said that file-trading firms had some responsibility for inducing people to piracy.  the lawsuit  brought by 28 of the world s largest entertainment firms  has raged for several years. legal experts agree that if the supreme court finds in favour of the music and movie industry they would be able to sue file-trading firms into bankruptcy. but if the judge rules that grokster and morpheus - the file-sharers at the centre of the case - are merely providers of technology that can have legitimate as well as illegitimate uses  then the music and movie industry would be forced to abandon its pursuit of file-sharing providers. instead  they would have to pursue individuals who use peer-to-peer networks to get their hands on free music and movies. the hi-tech and entertainment industries have been divided on the issue. intel filed a document with the supreme court earlier this month in defence of grokster and others  despite misgivings about some aspects of the file-sharing community. it summed up the attitude of many tech firms in its submission which states that its products  are essentially tools  that like any other tools  capable of being used by consumers and businesses for unlawful purposes .  asking firms to second-guess the uses that its technologies would be put to  and to build in ways of preventing illegitimate use  would stifle innovation  it said. the electronic frontier foundation  a civil rights watchdog  is also defending streamcast networks  the company behind the morpheus file-sharing software. the case raises a question of critical importance at the border between copyright and innovation  it said. it cites  as do many  the landmark ruling in 1984 which found that sony should not be held responsible for the fact that its betamax video recorder could be used for piracy. defenders remain optimistic that the judges will rule in favour of the peer-to-peer networks  upholding the precedent set by the sony betamax case. a small band of supporters were outside the court as the lawyers entered  wearing  save betamax  t-shirts.  the betamax principles stand as the magna carta for the technology industry and are responsible for the explosion in innovation that has occurred in the us over the past 20 years   said gary shapiro  chief executive of the consumer electronics association. supreme court justice stephen breyer said that inventions from printing to apple s ipod could be used to illegally duplicate copyrighted materials but had  on balance  been beneficial to society. he said that while file-trading software can be used to illegally trade movies and music  conceptually the technology had  some really excellent uses .  based on tuesday s hearing it seems unlikely that the betamax ruling will be overturned but file-sharing firms might still be held responsible for encouraging or inducing piracy. grokster s lawyer argued that the company should be judged by its current behaviour rather than what it did when it first set up. but this argument was dismissed as  ridiculous  by justice david souter. cea boss mr shapiro thinks the case is the most important that the supreme court will hear this year.  it s about preserving america s proud history of technological innovation and protecting the ability of consumers to access and utilise technology   he said. the case has already been heard by two lower courts and both found in favour of the peer-to-peer networks. they ruled that despite being used to distribute millions of illegal songs  file-sharing could also be used to cheaply distribute software  government documents and promotional copies of music.,court mull fileshar futur judg u suprem court hear evid fileshar network court decid whether produc fileshar softwar ultim held respons copyright

1034,325,dj double act revamp chart show dj duo jk and joel are taking over bbc radio 1 s flagship chart show on sunday  adding showbiz news  celebrity interviews and between-song banter.  they hope to boost ratings for the long-running show  which has been overtaken in popularity by independent radio s hit 40 uk rundown.  radio 1 s chart show is an institution and remains the station s single most popular show   says jk  also known as jason king.  for years people have been tuning in at four o clock with their tape recorders ready to record their favourite tunes. not that i ever did that.  but things have moved on a lot now so it was time for a change.   that change involved ejecting previous host wes butters and relocating king and dj partner joel ross from their weekend afternoon radio 1 slot. the pair have worked together for a decade - meeting on viking radio in hull before moving to manchester station key 103 and winning two sony radio awards. they also presented gadget series playboyz and car show motor maniacs for cable tv channel granada men and motors  and pure soap on bbc three.  on the revamped chart show their cheeky  laddish banter will punctuate star interviews and competitions  film and dvd charts plus a look at future single releases  in addition to the singles chart itself.  the chart rundown is no longer the only point of the programme   says ross.  the show used to be the only way to discover who was in the top 40. now you can just click on the internet to find that out  so the show has plenty of extra items too.  the show s reduced reliance upon the top 40 also reflects the fact that music fans are now more likely to download songs in digital format rather than buy them on compact disc  vinyl or cassette.   i personally buy downloads rather than cd singles   says 27-year-old ross.  even my grandma can download songs now. jk is still struggling with the technology  though.   but it s premature for people to say that the singles chart is dead   ross adds.  while sales of singles on traditional formats are down  interest in songs has been revived by download sales  which will be incorporated into our main chart rundown from april.  music fans still want to know what is the most popular song of the week.   ross will be plumping for chart success from rapper verbalicious and the stereophonics on sunday  while king is more of an r&b and dance music fan.  so listeners will get the advantage of both our music tastes   says king  30  who describes outgoing host butters as  an extremely professional and competent broadcaster .   the advantage joel and i have is that we re a double act  with a rapport between us that makes the show much more interactive   king says.  wes has a great broadcasting career ahead of him. and if not  i could always use a cleaner   he jokes. ross says the pair have done their best to ignore the weight of expectation placed upon the revamped show.  other people can worry about that  we are going to continue doing what we do well   he says.  at the end of the day this is a radio show that is meant to be entertaining. nobody died.,dj doubl act revamp chart show dj duo jk joel take bbc radio flagship chart show sunday ad showbiz news celebr interview betweensong banter hope boost rate longrun show overtaken popular independ radio hit uk rundown radio chart show institut remain station singl popular show say jk also know jason king year peopl tune four clock tape record readi record favourit tune ever thing move lot time chang chang involv eject previou host we butter reloc king dj partner joel ross weekend afternoon radio slot pair work togeth decad meet vike radio hull move manchest station key win two soni radio award also present gadget seri playboyz car show motor maniac cabl tv channel granada men motor pure soap bbc three revamp chart show cheeki laddish banter punctuat star interview competit film dvd chart plu look futur singl releas addit singl chart chart rundown longer point programm say ross show use way discov top click internet find show plenti extra item show reduc relianc upon top also reflect fact music fan like download song digit format rather buy compact disc vinyl cassett person buy download rather cd singl say yearold ross even grandma download song jk still struggl technolog though prematur peopl say singl chart dead ross add sale singl tradit format interest song reviv download sale incorpor main chart rundown april music fan still want know popular song week ross plump chart success rapper verbalici stereophon sunday king rb danc music fan listen get advantag music tast say king describ outgo host butter extrem profession compet broadcast advantag joel doubl act rapport u make show much interact king say we great broadcast career ahead could alway use cleaner joke ross say pair do best ignor weight expect place upon revamp show peopl worri go continu well say end day radio show meant entertain nobodi die

1039,840,format wars could  confuse users  technology firms sony  philips  matsushita and samsung are developing a common way to stop people pirating digital music and video.  the firms want to make a system that ensures files play on the hardware they make but also thwarts illegal copying. the move could mean more confusion for consumers already faced by many different  and conflicting  content control systems  experts warned. they say there are no guarantees the system will even prevent piracy.  currently many online stores wrap up downloadable files in an own-brand control system that means they can only be played on a small number of media players. systems that limit what people can do with the files they download are known as digital rights management systems. by setting up the alliance to work on a common control system  the firms said they hope to end this current fragmentation of file formats. in a joint statement the firms said they wanted to let consumers enjoy  appropriately licensed video and music on any device  independent of how they originally obtained that content . the firms hope that it will also make it harder for consumers to make illegal copies of the music  movies and other digital content they have bought. called the marlin joint development association  the alliance will define basic specifications that every device made by the electronics firms will conform to. marlin will be built on technology from rights management firm intertrust as well as an earlier drm system developed by a group known as the coral consortium.  the move is widely seen as a way for the four firms to decide their own destiny on content control systems instead of having to sign up for those being pushed by apple and microsoft. confusingly for consumers  the technology that comes out of the alliance will sit alongside the content control systems of rival firms such as microsoft and apple.  in many ways the different drm systems are akin to the different physical formats  such as betamax and vhs  that consumers have seen in the past   said ian fogg  personal technology and broadband analyst at jupiter research.  the difference is that it is very fragmented   he said.  it s not a two-horse race  it s a five  six  seven or even eight-horse race  mr fogg said consumers had to be very careful when buying digital content to ensure that it would play on the devices they own. he said currently there were even incompatibilities within drm families. although initiatives such as microsoft s  plays for sure  program could help remove some of the uncertainty  he said  life was likely to be confusing for consumers for some time to come.  shelley taylor  analyst and author of a report about online music services  said the locks and limits on digital files were done to maximise the cash that firms can make from consumers. apple s itunes service was a perfect example of this  she said.  although itunes has been hugely successful  apple could not justify its existence if it did not help sell all those ipods   she said.  she said rampant competition between online music services  of which there are now 230 according to recent figures  could drive more openness and freer file formats.  it always works out that consumer needs win out in the long run   she said   and the services that win in the long run are the ones that listen to consumers earliest.  ms taylor said the limits legal download services place on files could help explain the continuing popularity of file-sharing systems that let people get hold of pirated pop.  people want portability   she said   and with peer-to-peer they have 100% portability.  cory doctorow  european co-ordinator for the electronic frontier foundation which campaigns for consumers on many cyber-rights issues  expressed doubts that the marlin system would achieve its aims.  not one of these systems has ever prevented piracy or illegal copying   he said. he said many firms readily admit that their drm systems are little protection against skilled attackers such as the organised crime gangs that are responsible for most piracy. instead  said mr doctorow  drm systems were intended to control the group that electronics firms have most hold over - consumers.  the studios and labels perceive an opportunity to sell you your media again and again - the ipod version  the auto version  the american and uk version  the ringtone version  and so on.,format war could confus user technolog firm soni philip matsushita samsung develop common way stop peopl pirat digit music video firm want make system ensur file play hardwar make also thwart illeg copi move could mean confus consum alreadi face mani differ conflict content control system expert warn say guarante system even prevent piraci current mani onlin store wrap download file ownbrand control system mean play small number medium player system limit peopl file download know digit right manag system set allianc work common control system firm say hope end current fragment file format joint statement firm say want let consum enjoy appropri licens video music devic independ origin obtain content firm hope also make harder consum make illeg copi music movi digit content bought call marlin joint develop associ allianc defin basic specif everi devic make electron firm conform marlin built technolog right manag firm intertrust well earlier drm system develop group know coral consortium move wide see way four firm decid destini content control system instead sign push appl microsoft confusingli consum technolog come allianc sit alongsid content control system rival firm microsoft appl mani way differ drm system akin differ physic format betamax vh consum see past say ian fogg person technolog broadband analyst jupit research differ fragment say twohors race five six seven even eighthors race mr fogg say consum care buy digit content ensur would play devic say current even incompat within drm famili although initi microsoft play sure program could help remov uncertainti say life like confus consum time come shelley taylor analyst author report onlin music servic say lock limit digit file do maximis cash firm make consum appl itun servic perfect exampl say although itun huge success appl could justifi exist help sell ipod say say rampant competit onlin music servic accord recent figur could drive open freer file format alway work consum need win long run say servic win long run one listen consum early m taylor say limit legal download servic place file could help explain continu popular fileshar system let peopl get hold pirat pop peopl want portabl say peertop portabl cori doctorow european coordin electron frontier foundat campaign consum mani cyberright issu express doubt marlin system would achiev aim one system ever prevent piraci illeg copi say say mani firm readili admit drm system littl protect skill attack organis crime gang respons piraci instead say mr doctorow drm system intend control group electron firm hold consum studio label perceiv opportun sell medium ipod version auto version american uk version rington version

1041,1031,blair defends terror law changes the prime minister has defended measures to allow house arrest without trial  saying  several hundred  people in the uk are plotting terror attacks.  the government is facing opposition from tory and lib dem mps and its own backbenchers as it prepares for the final commons debate on the changes. but tony blair said there could be no concession on the  basic principle . mr blair told the bbc the  control orders  would only be used in the most limited circumstances. critics in the opposition and civil rights activists are worried that the home secretary will have the power to issue the detention orders. but the government has so far resisted pressure for judges to be responsible for making the orders  instead saying judges will be able to quash them.  an explanation is being sent by home secretary charles clarke to all mps and peers ahead of the final debate in the house of commons. on sunday  conservative shadow home secretary david davis claimed judges would get the powers to issue detention orders. and liberal democrat leader charles kennedy said some concessions had already been offered by the government during last-minute negotiations. some 32 labour mps voted against the legislation last week. barbara follett  whose first husband was killed while under house arrest in south africa during the apartheid era  confirmed she would vote against the government.  but the government is continuing to insist that  control orders  must be issued by the home secretary. mr blair told bbc radio 4 s woman s hour:  we are being advised by the police and the security services...  what they say is you have got to give us powers in between mere surveillance of these people - there are several hundred of them in this country who we believe are engaged in plotting or trying to commit terrorist acts - you have got to give us power in between just surveying them and being able  being sure enough of the proof  to prosecute them beyond reasonable doubt.  and these will be restrictions on their liberty that we will use only in the most limited circumstances.   a yougov poll in the daily telegraph suggested 75% of respondents thought action was sometimes necessary against people who had not committed an offence but who had been found by intelligence services to be planning a terrorist attack. but tory leader michael howard told bbc news that the government was again making a mistake in  rushing  anti-terrorism legislation.  i very much hope it would be possible to reach a compromise on this.  he said after meeting tony blair he had been left with the impression that  he really wasn t interested in any of the various proposals we have put forward . mr clarke wants house arrest and other powers to replace indefinite jail for terror suspects - something the law lords have ruled against on the basis that it breaches human rights. bbc political correspondent vicky young said some form of concession on the measures was likely to be needed to get the legislation through the house of lords  where labour does not have a majority and would require support from other parties. shami chakrabarti  director of civil liberties pressure group liberty  said who was able to issue the control orders was not the main issue. she said the legislation was  a travesty and a perversion of justice  and would remain  unpalatable  even if a judge was involved early in the process.,blair defend terror law chang prime minist defend measur allow hous arrest without trial say sever hundr peopl uk plot terror attack govern face opposit torus lib dem mp backbench prepar final common debat chang toni blair say could concess basic principl mr blair told bbc control order would use limit circumst critic opposit civil right activist worri home secretari power issu detent order govern far resist pressur judg respons make order instead say judg abl quash explan sent home secretari charl clark mp peer ahead final debat hous common sunday conserv shadow home secretari david davi claim judg would get power issu detent order liber democrat leader charl kennedi say concess alreadi offer govern lastminut negoti labour mp vote legisl last week barbara follett whose first husband kill hous arrest south africa apartheid era confirm would vote govern govern continu insist control order must issu home secretari mr blair told bbc radio woman hour advis polic secur servic say get give u power mere surveil peopl sever hundr countri believ engag plot tri commit terrorist act get give u power survey abl sure enough proof prosecut beyond reason doubt restrict liberti use limit circumst yougov poll daili telegraph suggest respond thought action sometim necessari peopl commit offenc found intellig servic plan terrorist attack torus leader michael howard told bbc news govern make mistak rush antiterror legisl much hope would possibl reach compromis say meet toni blair left impress realli interest variou propos put forward mr clark want hous arrest power replac indefinit jail terror suspect someth law lord rule basi breach human right bbc polit correspond vicki young say form concess measur like need get legisl hous lord labour major would requir support parti shami chakrabarti director civil liberti pressur group liberti say abl issu control order main issu say legisl travesti pervers justic would remain unpalat even judg involv earli process
1042,32,firefox browser takes on microsoft microsoft s internet explorer has a serious rival in the long-awaited firefox 1.0 web browser  which has just been released.  few people get excited when some new software is released  especially when the program is not a game or a music or movie player. but the release of the first full version of firefox has managed to drum up a respectable amount of pre-launch fervour. fans of the software have banded together to raise cash to pay for an advert in the new york times announcing that version 1.0 of the browser is available. the release of firefox 1.0 on 9 november might even cause a few heads to turn at microsoft because the program is steadily winning people away from the software giant s internet explorer browser.  firefox has been created by the mozilla foundation which was started by former browser maker netscape back in 1998. much of the development work done since then has gone into firefox which made its first appearance under this name in february. earlier incarnations  but which had the same core technology  were called phoenix and firebird. since then the software has been gaining praise and converts  not least because of the large number of security problems that have come to light in microsoft s internet explorer. rivals to ie got a boost in late june when two us computer security organisations warned people to avoid the microsoft program to avoid falling victim to a serious vulnerability.  internet monitoring firm websidestory has charted the growing population of people using the firefox browser and says it is responsible for slowly eroding the stranglehold of ie. before july this year  according to websidestory  internet explorer was used by about 95% of web surfers. that figure had remained static for years. in july the ie using population dropped to 94.7% and by the end of october stood at 92.9%. the mozilla foundation claims that firefox has been downloaded almost eight million times and has publicly said it would be happy to garner 10% of the windows- using  net-browsing population. firefox is proving popular because  at the moment  it has far fewer security holes than internet explorer and has some innovations lacking in microsoft s program. for instance  firefox allows the pages of different websites to be arranged as tabs so users can switch easily between them. it blocks pop-ups  has a neat way of finding text on a page and lets you search through the pages you have browsed.  one of the most powerful features of firefox is the many hundreds of extras  or extensions  produced for it. the mozilla foundation is an open source organisation which means that the creators of the browser are happy for others to play around with the core code for the program. this has resulted in many different add-ons or extensions for the browser which now include everything from a version of the familiar google toolbar to a homeland security monitor that keep users aware of current threat levels. firefox  which used to be called firebird and before that phoenix  also has a growing number of vocal net-based fans. a campaign co-ordinated by the spread firefox website attempted to raise the $50 000 needed for a full page advert in the new york times. the campaign set itself a target of recruiting 2500 volunteers. ten days in to the campaign 10 000 people had signed up and now about $250 000 has been raised. the ad is due to run sometime in a three-week period in late november/early december. the surplus cash will be used to help keep the mozilla foundation running. microsoft is facing a growing challenge to ie s hold on the web using population. from alternative browsers such as opera  safari  amaya and even netscape.,firefox browser take microsoft microsoft internet explor

1043,801,more women turn to net security older people and women are increasingly taking charge of protecting home computers against malicious net attacks  according to a two-year study.  the number of women buying programs to protect pcs from virus  spam and spyware attacks rose by 11.2% each year between 2002 and 2004. the study  for net security firm preventon  shows that security messages are reaching a diversity of surfers. it is thought that 40% of those buying home net security programs are retired. for the last three years  that has gone up by an average of 13.2%. but more retired women (53%) were buying security software than retired men. the research reflects the changing stereotype and demographics of web users  as well as growing awareness of the greater risks that high-speed broadband net connections can pose to surfers.  the study predicts that 40% of all home pc net security buyers will be women in 2005. they could even overtake men as the main buyers by 2007  if current rates persist  according to the research.  i think older people have become more vigilant about protecting their pcs as we tend to be more cautious and want an insurance policy in case something does go wrong   said one over-60 woman who took part in the research.   you started off with young male stereotype computer users for last 10 years   paul goosens  head of preventon told the bbc news website.  now we are seeing real people - both sexes and very often it is women who have more access at home.  but net service providers still need to take more responsibility in making sure people are educated about net threats before they go online  particuarly if they are new to broadband  he said.  programs also need to be tailored so that they can be installed by dial-up users with a slower connection too  said mr goosens. security software should be easy to use  with simple interfaces and instructions written in non-technical language  he added. the nature of the security threats are also becoming more than just about e-mail viruses. high-profile complaints about rogue diallers  and spyware or other programs that surreptitiously install themselves on computers  have also raised awareness about the need to have a combination of anti-virus  firewall and spyware-removal programs too. without protection  these kinds of programs can be picked up just through surfing the web normally.  more than 30 000 pcs a day globally are being recruited into networks that spread spam and viruses  a study from security from symantec showed last year. viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are also getting rarer  according to net security experts. programs are being unleashed to directly profit criminal gangs  many based in eastern europe  over those which are designed to show off technical skills or cause nuisance. the research shows that more people are taking these criminal net threats more seriously because  said mr goosens  they are reported in the press much more.  you are seeing older users being educated by the media and are seeing them picking up on this threat. they are asking the right questions   he explained.  it is more likely the younger users who naively assume that because they are using a reputable service provider  that they are safe to connect to the net.  an unprotected computer on a broadband connection can be breached and infected with viruses or spyware within minutes. by the end of the year it is thought that more than 30% of uk homes will have broadband net access. in july last year  the number of uk households accessing the net via broadband surpassed those using dial-up for the first time  according to the office of national statistics.,woman turn net secur old peopl woman increasingli take charg protect home comput malici net attack accord twoyear studi number woman buy program protect pc viru spam spywar attack rise year studi net secur firm preventon show secur messag reach diver surfer thought buy home net secur program retir last three year go averag retir woman buy secur softwar retir men research reflect chang stereotyp demograph web user well grow awar great risk highspe broadband net connect pose surfer studi predict home pc net secur buyer woman could even overtak men main buyer current rate persist accord research think old peopl becom vigil protect pc tend cautiou want insur polici case someth go wrong say one over woman take part research start young male stereotyp comput user last year paul goosen head preventon told bbc news websit see real peopl sex often woman access home net servic provid still need take respons make sure peopl educ net threat go onlin particuarli new broadband say program also need tailor instal dialup user slow connect say mr goosen secur softwar easi use simpl interfac instruct write nontechn languag ad natur secur threat also becom email virus highprofil complaint rogu dialler spywar program surreptiti instal comput also rais awar need combin antiviru firewal spywareremov program without protect kind program pick surf web normal pc day global recruit network spread spam virus studi secur symantec show last year virus write make headlin infect million also get rarer accord net secur expert program unleash directli profit crimin gang mani base eastern europ design show technic skill caus nuisanc research show peopl take crimin net threat serious say mr goosen report press much see old user educ medium see pick threat ask right question explain like young user naiv assum use reput servic provid safe connect net unprotect comput broadband connect breach infect virus spywar within minut end year thought uk home broadband net access juli last year number uk household access net via broadband surpass use dialup first time accord offic nation statist
1044,1772,apple laptop is  greatest gadget  the apple powerbook 100 has been chosen as the greatest gadget of all time  by us magazine mobile pc.  the 1991 laptop was chosen because it was one of the first  lightweight  portable computers and helped define the layout of all future notebook pcs. the magazine has compiled an all-time top 100 list of gadgets  which includes the sony walkman at number three and the 1956 zenith remote control at two. gadgets needed moving parts and/or electronics to warrant inclusion. the magazine specified that gadgets also needed to be a  self-contained apparatus that can be used on its own  not a subset of another device .   in general we included only items that were potentially mobile   said the magazine.   in the end  we tried to get to the heart of what really makes a gadget a gadget   it concluded. the oldest  gadget  in the top 100 is the abacus  which the magazine dates at 190 a.d.  and put in 60th place. other pre-electronic gadgets in the top 100 include the sextant from 1731 (59th position)  the marine chronometer from 1761 (42nd position) and the kodak brownie camera from 1900 (28th position). the tivo personal video recorder is the newest device to make the top 10  which also includes the first flash mp3 player (diamound multimedia)  as well as the first  successful  digital camera (casio qv-10) and mobile phone (motorola startac). the most popular gadget of the moment  the apple ipod  is at number 12 in the list while the first sony transistor radio is at number 13.  sony s third entry in the top 20 is the cdp-101 cd player from 1983.  who can forget the crystalline  hiss-free blast of madonna s like a virgin emenating from their first cd player   asked the magazine. karl elsener s knife  the swiss army knife from 1891  is at number 20 in the list. gadgets which could be said to feature surprisngly low down in the list include the original telephone (23rd)  the nintendo gameboy (25th)  and the pulsar quartz digital watch (36th). the list also contains plenty of oddities: the pez sweet dispenser (98th)  1980s toy tamagotchi (86th) and the bizarre ronco inside the shell egg scrambler (84th).  why worry about mobile phones. soon they will be subsumed into the pda s / laptops etc.  what about the marine chronometer  completely revolutionised navigation for boats and was in use for centuries. for it s time  a technological marvel!  sony net minidisc! it paved the way for more mp3 player to explode onto the market. i always used my netmd  and could not go anywhere without it.  a laptop computer is not a gadget! it s a working tool!  the sinclair executive was the world s first pocket calculator. i think this should be there as well.  how about the clockwork radio  or gps  or a pocket calculator  all these things are useful to real people  not just pc magazine editors.  are the people who created this list insane   surely the most important gadget of the modern age is the mobile phone  it has revolutionalised communication  which is more than can be said for a niche market laptop. from outside the modern age  the marine chronometer is the single most important gadget  without which modern transportation systems would not have evolved so quickly.  has everyone forgot about the breville pie maker    an interesting list. of the electronic gadgets  thousands of journalists in the early 1980s blessed the original noteboook pc - the tandy 100. the size of a4 paper and light  three weeks on a set of batteries  an excellent keyboard  a modem. a pity tandy did not make it dos compatible.  what s an apple powerbook 100   it s out of date - not much of a  gadget . surely it has to be something simple / timeless - the tin opener  swiss army knife  safety razor blade  wristwatch or the thing for taking stones out of horses hooves    it has to be the mobile phone. no other single device has had such an effect on our way of living in such a short space of time.  the ball point pen has got to be one of the most used and common gadgets ever. also many might be grateful for the pocket calculator which was a great improvement over the slide rule.  the casio pocket calculator that played a simple game and made tinny noises was also a hot gadget in 1980. a true gadget  it could be carried around and shown off.  all top 10 are electronic toys  so the list is probably a better reflection of the current high-tech obsession than anyhting else. i say this as the swiss army knife only made no 20.  sinclair ql a machine far ahead of its time. the first home machine with a true multi-takings os. shame the marketing was so bad!!!  apple.. a triumph of fashion over... well everything else.  utter rubbish. yes  the apple laptop and sony walkman are classic gadgets. but to call the sextant and the marine chronometer  gadgets  and rank them as less important than a tv remote control reveals a quite shocking lack of historical perspective. the former literally helped change the world by vastly improving navigation at see. the latter is the seed around which the couch potato culture has developed. no competition.  i d also put apple s newton and the first palm pilot there as the front runners for portable computing  and possibly the toshiba libretto for the same reason. i only wish that vulcan inc s flipstart wasn t just vapourware otherwise it would be at the top.  how did a laptop ever manage to beat off the challenge of the wristwatch or the telephone (mobile or otherwise)  what about radios and tvs   the swiss army knife. by far the most useful gadget. i got mine 12 years ago. still wearing and using it a lot! it stood the test of time.  psion organiser series 3  should be up there. had a usable qwerty keyboard  removable storage  good set of apps and programmable. case design was good (batteries in the hinge - a first  i think). great product innovation.  the first mobile pc was voted best gadget by readers of...err... mobile pc ! why do you keep putting these obviously biased lists on your site  it s obviously the mobile phone or remote control  and readers of a less partisan publication would tell you that.  the motorola startac should be number one. why  there will be mobile phones long after notebook computers and other gadgets are either gone or integrated in communications devices.  the psion series 3c! the first most practical way to carry all your info around...  i too would back the sinclair spectrum - without this little beauty i would never have moved into the world of it and earn the living that i do now.  i d have put the mobile phone high up the list. probably a nokia model.  sinclair spectrum - 16k. it plugged into the tv. games were rubbish but it gave me a taste for programming and that s what i do for a living now.  i wish more modern notebooks -- even apple s newest offerings -- were more like the pb100. particularly disheartening is the demise of the trackball  which has given way to the largely useless  trackpad  which every notebook on the market today uses. they re invariably inaccurate  uncomfortable  and cumbersome to use.  congratulations to apple  a deserved win!,appl laptop great gadget appl powerbook chosen great gadget time u magazin mobil pc laptop chosen one first lightweight portabl comput help defin layout futur notebook pc magazin compil alltim top list gadget includ soni walkman number three zenith remot control two gadget need move part andor electron warrant inclus magazin specifi gadget also need selfcontain apparatu use subset anoth devic gener includ item potenti mobil say magazin end tri get heart realli make gadget gadget conclud old gadget top abacu magazin date ad put th place preelectron gadget top includ sextant th posit marin chronomet nd posit kodak browni camera th posit tivo person video record new devic make top also includ first flash mp player diamound multimedia well first success digit camera casio qv mobil phone motorola startac popular gadget moment appl ipod number list first soni transistor radio number soni third entri top cdp cd player forget crystallin hissfre blast madonna like virgin emen first cd player ask magazin karl elsen knife swiss armi knife number list gadget could say featur surprisngli low list includ origin telephon rd nintendo gameboy th pulsar quartz digit watch th list also contain plenti odditi pez sweet dispens th s toy tamagotchi th bizarr ronco insid shell egg scrambler th worri mobil phone soon subsum pda laptop etc marin chronomet complet revolutionis navig boat use centuri time technolog marvel soni net minidisc pave way mp player explod onto market alway use netmd could go anywher without laptop comput gadget work tool sinclair execut world first pocket calcul think well clockwork radio gp pocket calcul thing use real peopl pc magazin editor peopl creat list insan sure import gadget modern age mobil phone revolutionalis commun say nich market laptop outsid modern age marin chronomet singl import gadget without modern transport system would evolv quickli everyon forgot brevil pie maker interest list electron gadget thousand journalist earli s bless origin noteboook pc tandi size a paper light three week set batteri excel keyboard modem piti tandi make do compat appl powerbook date much gadget sure someth simpl timeless tin open swiss armi knife safeti razor blade wristwatch thing take stone hors hoov mobil phone singl devic effect way live short space time ball point pen get one use common gadget ever also mani might grate pocket calcul great improv slide rule casio pocket calcul play simpl game make tinni nois also hot gadget true gadget could carri around show top electron toy list probabl well reflect current hightech ob anyht el say swiss armi knife make sinclair ql machin far ahead time first home machin true multitak o shame market bad appl triumph fashion well everyth el utter rubbish ye appl laptop soni walkman classic gadget call sextant marin chronomet gadget rank less import tv remot control reveal quit shock lack histor perspect former liter help chang world vastli improv navig see latter seed around couch potato cultur develop competit also put appl newton first palm pilot front runner portabl comput possibl toshiba libretto reason wish vulcan inc flipstart vapourwar otherwis would top laptop ever manag beat challeng wristwatch telephon mobil otherwis radio tv swiss armi knife far use gadget get mine year ago still wear use lot stood test time psion organis seri usabl qwerti keyboard remov storag good set app programm case design good batteri hing first think great product innov first mobil pc vote best gadget reader oferr mobil pc keep put obvious bias list site obvious mobil phone remot control reader less partisan public would tell motorola startac number one mobil phone long notebook comput gadget either go integr commun devic psion seri c first practic way carri info around would back sinclair spectrum without littl beauti would never move world earn live put mobil phone high list probabl nokia model sinclair spectrum k plug tv game rubbish give tast program live wish modern notebook even appl new offer like pb particularli dishearten demis trackbal give way larg useless trackpad everi notebook market today use invari inaccur uncomfort cumbersom use congratul appl deserv win

1046,1139,euro firms miss out on optimism more than 90% of large companies around the world are highly optimistic about their economic prospects  a survey of 1 300 bosses suggests.  their biggest worries are not terror threats  but over-regulation  low-cost competition and the wild ups and downs of oil prices. there is one exception: firms in western europe - but not the uk - are lacking confidence after years of slow growth. when business advisers pricewaterhousecoopers (pwc) conducted the same survey two years ago  nearly 30% of bosses were gloomy about their prospects.  global business leaders say that they are facing a two-pronged regulatory assault. after a string of corporate scandals in the united states - from enron to worldcom - the sarbanes-oxley act forces companies to be much more transparent  but doing all the paperwork costs a lot of time and money. across europe  meanwhile  all stock exchange-listed companies are currently in the process of moving to new and complex accounting standards called ifrs. hacking through the red tape can hardly be avoided  but many chief executives around the world appear to have decided on how to deal with low-cost competitors.  already  about 28% of the bosses polled for the survey say that they have moved parts of their business into low-wage countries  and another 11% plan to do so in the future. possibly as a result  the worry about low-cost competition has slightly fallen from last year  with just 54% of companies calling it a  significant threat  or  one of the biggest threats . but pwc s global chief executive  samuel dipiazza  said a growing number of companies were also concerned that moves to outsource work to cheaper countries could both hurt their reputation in their home markets and harm the quality of service they provide to their customers.  according to frank brown  global advisory leader at pwc   the trend of large companies to have global operations has one clear upside:  one risk in one region - for example the middle east - won t kill your business anymore.  surprisingly  the survey suggests that the rapid decline of the us dollar is not seen as a huge threat anymore  unlike even a year ago  when it was cited as the third-largest problem. mr dipiazza said the interviews with chief executives suggested that companies had  adjusted  to the new reality of a euro that buys $1.30 and more  while others had successfully hedged their positions and locked in more favourable exchange rates.    - for the survey  pricewaterhousecoopers interviewed 1 324 chief executives throughout the world during the last three months of 2004.,euro firm miss optim larg compani around world highli optimist econom prospect survey bos suggest big worri terror threat overregul lowcost competit wild up down oil price one except firm western europ uk lack confid year slow growth busi advis pricewaterhousecoop pwc conduct survey two year ago nearli bos gloomi prospect global busi leader say face twoprong regulatori assault string corpor scandal unit state enron worldcom sarbanesoxley act forc compani much transpar paperwork cost lot time money across europ meanwhil stock exchangelist compani current process move new complex account standard call ifr hack red tape hardli avoid mani chief execut around world appear decid deal lowcost competitor alreadi bos poll survey say move part busi lowwag countri anoth plan futur possibl result worri lowcost competit slightli fall last year compani call signific threat one big threat pwc global chief execut samuel dipiazza say grow number compani also concern move outsourc work cheaper countri could hurt reput home market harm qualiti servic provid custom accord frank brown global advisori leader pwc trend larg compani global oper one clear upsid one risk one region exampl middl east kill busi anymor surprisingli survey suggest rapid declin u dollar see huge threat anymor unlik even year ago cite thirdlargest problem mr dipiazza say interview chief execut suggest compani adjust new realiti euro buy other success hedg posit lock favour exchang rate survey pricewaterhousecoop interview chief execut throughout world last three month

1049,1053,bush website blocked outside us surfers outside the us have been unable to visit the official re-election site of president george w bush.  the blocking of browsers sited outside the us began in the early hours of monday morning. since then people outside the us trying to browse the site get a message saying they are not authorised to view it. the blocking does not appear to be due to an attack by vandals or malicious hackers  but as a result of a policy decision by the bush camp.  the international exclusion zone around georgewbush.com was spotted by net monitoring firm netcraft which keeps an eye on traffic patterns across many different sites. netcraft said that since the early hours of 25 october attempts to view the site through its monitoring stations in london  amsterdam and sydney failed.  by contrast netcraft s four monitoring stations in the us managed to view the site with no problems. the site can still be seen using anonymous proxy services that are based in the us. some web users in canada also report that they can browse the site. the pattern of traffic to the website suggests that the blocking was not due to an attack by vandals or politically motivated hackers. geographic blocking works because the numerical addresses that the net uses to organise itself are handed out on a regional basis. on 21 october  the george w bush website began using the services of a company called akamai to ensure that the pages  videos and other content on its site reaches visitors. mike prettejohn  president of netcraft  speculated that the blocking decision might have been taken to cut costs  and traffic  in the run-up to the election on 2 november. he said the site may see no reason to distribute content to people who will not be voting next week. managing traffic could also be a good way to ensure that the site stays working in the closing days of the election campaign. however  simply blocking non-us visitors also means that americans overseas are barred too. akamai declined to comment  saying it could not talk about customer websites.,bush websit block outsid u surfer outsid u unabl visit offici reelect site presid georg w bush block browser site outsid u begin earli hour monday morn sinc peopl outsid u tri brow site get messag say authoris view block appear due attack vandal malici hacker result polici decis bush camp intern exclus zone around georgewbushcom spot net monitor firm netcraft keep eye traffic pattern across mani differ site netcraft say sinc earli hour octob attempt view site monitor station london amsterdam sydney fail contrast netcraft four monitor station u manag view site problem site still see use anonym proxi servic base u web user canada also report brow site pattern traffic websit suggest block due attack vandal polit motiv hacker geograph block work numer address net use organis hand region basi octob georg w bush websit begin use servic compani call akamai ensur page video content site reach visitor mike prettejohn presid netcraft specul block decis might take cut cost traffic runup elect novemb say site may see reason distribut content peopl vote next week manag traffic could also good way ensur site stay work close day elect campaign howev simpli block nonu visitor also mean american oversea bar akamai declin comment say could talk custom websit
1050,1878,sa unveils  more for all  budget the south african government has put tax cuts and increased social spending at the centre of its latest budget.  aiming to both stir economic growth and aid the country s poor  finance minister trevor manuel said the focus of the 2005 budget was  more for all . the tax cuts target firms and individuals  cutting corporate tax from 30% to 29% and offering income tax cuts worth 6.8bn rand ($1.2bn; £910m). spending on health and education will rise by 9.4% and 8.1% respectively. spending on housing and sanitation will rise by 12%. all the spending increases will run over the next three years.  unveiling the 418bn-rand budget to parliament  mr manuel said the south african economy had grown by an average of 3.2% over the past four years  slightly below the african average of 4%.  he predicted that the south african economy would grow by 4.3% in 2005 and 4.2% in 2006. mr manuel added that inflation fell to 4.3% in 2004 and is expected to remain at between 3% and 6% from now until at least 2008  helped by interest rates which are at their lowest level in 24 years. given that both corporate and personal taxes are being cut - under the new measures  those earning less than 35 000 rand a year will be exempt from income tax - the extra 22.3bn rand in social spending will be partly met by higher fuel  tobacco and alcohol taxes.   in this budget  the focus is on more for all  not more for some  and not a hell of a lot more for a few  but spread across all of south africa   said mr manuel. he said that the economic situation was a  marked improvement  on the position at the end of apartheid  but acknowledged that more needed to be done to improve the lives and livelihoods of the disadvantaged. about 280 000 jobs a year have been created in south africa since 2000 but unemployment remains high  currently close to 30%. economist colen garrow said the budget looked as if it would stimulate economic growth.  it s pleasant to see the cut in company taxes  it s a good incentive for business   he said.,sa unveil budget south african govern put tax cut increas social spend centr late budget aim stir econom growth aid countri poor financ minist trevor manuel say focu budget tax cut target firm individu cut corpor tax offer incom tax cut worth bn rand bn £m spend health educ rise respect spend hous sanit rise spend increas run next three year unveil bnrand budget parliament mr manuel say south african economi grown averag past four year slightli african averag predict south african economi would grow mr manuel ad inflat fell expect remain least help interest rate low level year give corpor person tax cut new measur earn less rand year exempt incom tax extra bn rand social spend partli met high fuel tobacco alcohol tax budget focu hell lot spread across south africa say mr manuel say econom situat mark improv posit end apartheid acknowledg need do improv live livelihood disadvantag job year creat south africa sinc unemploy remain high current close economist colen garrow say budget look would stimul econom growth pleasant see cut compani tax good incent busi say
1051,466,philippoussis doubt over open bid mark philippoussis is almost certain to miss the australian open after suffering a groin injury during the hopman cup loss to the netherlands.  the 28-year-old suffered two tears to the adductor muscle and was unable to play in the deciding mixed doubles. he is now unlikely to be fit in time for the australian open which begins on 17 january in melbourne.  he has to strengthen it enough to cope with repetitive days of tennis   said hopman cup doctor hamish osborne.  it would be very unlikely in my opinion for him to do a five-setter once  let alone two days in a row  inside two weeks.   the injury is more common in australian rules football  and a fit footballer would normally take three to four weeks to recover fully although mark s injury is slightly different.  the australian has suffered a host of injury problems throughout his career but is still holding out slim hope that he can make the event.  it s something i ll have to go by feel. i ll start treatment as soon as possible and try to strengthen it without tearing it any more   he said.  what doesn t kill you makes you stronger. i know i can come back from this and that s all that matters.  - former world number two tommy haas is also a doubt for the australian open after picking up a thigh injury playing for germany in the hopman cup. the 26-year-old had treatment on his left thigh while leading argentine guillermo coria 7-5 2-2. he played one more game  but his movement was hampered and he quit.,philippoussi doubt open bid mark philippoussi almost certain miss australian open suffer groin injuri hopman cup loss netherland yearold suffer two tear adductor muscl unabl play decid mix doubl unlik fit time australian open begin januari melbourn strengthen enough cope repetit day tenni say hopman cup doctor hamish osborn would unlik opinion fivesett let alon two day row insid two week injuri common australian rule footbal fit footbal would normal take three four week recov fulli although mark injuri slightli differ australian suffer host injuri problem throughout career still hold slim hope make event someth go feel start treatment soon possibl tri strengthen without tear say kill make strong know come back matter former world number two tommi haa also doubt australian open pick thigh injuri play germani hopman cup yearold treatment left thigh lead argentin guillermo corium play one game movement hamper quit

1055,479,rap feud in 50 cent s g-unit crew us rap star 50 cent has said he has thrown protege the game out of his g-unit gang in a feud that has apparently involved two shootings.  in a radio interview on monday  50 cent said the newcomer was disloyal in conflicts with other rappers. a man was shot in the thigh outside new york s hot 97 studios while 50 cent was on air. more shots were fired outside his management offices two hours later. 50 cent appeared on the game s debut album  which was number one in the us. 50 cent  whose second album is about to be released after his debut made him one of hip-hop s biggest stars  has been involved in recent rivalries with fellow artists including fat joe  nas and jadakiss.  he has claimed credit for the success of the game  who has become the hottest new star on the rap scene. both were drug dealers and were shot before turning to music.  in an interview with hot 97 on saturday  the game described some of 50 cent s rivals as  my friends  and said he would not turn on them.  nas is one of my friends  and jada s really a homie   he said.  50 s beef is 50 s beef and i really don t know where all this stems from.  when 50 cent appeared on the same station two days later  he said the game was no longer a member of g-unit.  every record he s selling is based on me being on his record with him   he said. when the shooting took place outside the studio  the interview was ended and the rapper was escorted out of the building by security personnel.  an unidentified 24-year-old los angeles man is stable with a gunshot wound to the upper thigh. police say the game s associates may have heard the interview and gone to the studio  where they confronted 50 cent s entourage. officers are also investigating a later shooting in which eight bullets were fired into the door of 50 cent s management company  violator. no arrests have been made in relation to either incident. 50 cent s second album  the massacre  is released on thursday  five weeks after the game s debut  documentary  went to number one.  elliott wilson  editor-in-chief of hip-hop magazine xxl  said the feud would boost publicity for 50 cent s release.  it helps him obviously in terms of exposure. you can t ask for better promotion   he said. but he added:  i think he s making more and more enemies.  you definitely feel like is he doing too much of a tupac spiral  like me against the world. you bring more people wanting to see you fail.  tupac shakur was shot dead in 1996.,rap feud cent gunit crew u rap star cent say thrown proteg game gunit gang feud appar involv two shoot radio interview monday cent say newcom disloy conflict rapper man shot thigh outsid new york hot studio cent air shot fire outsid manag offic two hour later cent appear game debut album number one u cent whose second album releas debut make one hiphop big star involv recent rivalri fellow artist includ fat joe na jadakiss claim credit success game becom hottest new star rap scene drug dealer shot turn music interview hot saturday game describ cent rival friend say would turn na one friend jada realli homi say beef beef realli know stem cent appear station two day later say game longer member gunit everi record sell base record say shoot take place outsid studio interview end rapper escort build secur personnel unidentifi yearold lo angel man stabl gunshot wound upper thigh polic say game associ may heard interview go studio confront cent entourag offic also investig later shoot eight bullet fire door cent manag compani violat arrest make relat either incid cent second album massacr releas thursday five week game debut documentari go number one elliott wilson editorinchief hiphop magazin xxl say feud would boost public cent releas help obvious term exposur ask well promot say ad think make enemi definit feel like much tupac spiral like world bring peopl want see fail tupac shakur shot dead
1056,1756,2d metal slug offers retro fun like some drill sergeant from the past  metal slug 3 is a wake-up call to today s gamers molly-coddled with slick visuals and fancy trimmings.  with its hand-animated sprites and 2d side-scrolling  this was even considered retro when released in arcades four years ago. but a more frantic shooter you will not find at the end of your joypad this year. and yes  that includes halo 2. simply choose your grunt and wade through five 2d side-scrolling levels of the most hectic video game blasting you will ever encounter. it is also the toughest game you are likely to play  as hordes of enemies and few lives pile the pressure on.  players must battle soldiers  snowmen  zombies  giant crabs and aliens  not to mention the huge  screen-filling bosses that guard each of the five levels.  the shoot-anything-that-moves gameplay is peppered with moments of old-school genius. fans of robotic gastropods should note the title refers  instead  to the vast array of vehicles on offer in a game stuffed with bizarre hardware. tanks  jets and submarines can be commandeered  as well as cannon-toting camels  elephants and ostriches - more weaponry on offer than in an acre of iraq. doling out justice is a joy thanks to ultra responsive controls  and while this is a tough nut to crack  it is addictive enough to have you gagging for that one last go. and at a mere £20  metal slug 3 is as cheap as sliced  fried spuds  as the man says. of course  most of you will ignore this  lacking as it does the visual fireworks of modern blasters. but at a time when blockbuster titles offer only a fresh lick of paint in favour of real innovation  metal slug 3 is a fresh gasp of air from an era when the xbox was not even a twinkle in bill gates  eye.,d metal slug offer retro fun like drill sergeant past metal slug wakeup call today gamer mollycoddl slick visual fanci trim handanim sprite d sidescrol even consid retro releas arcad four year ago frantic shooter find end joypad year ye includ halo simpli choos grunt wade five d sidescrol level hectic video game blast ever encount also toughest game like play hord enemi live pile pressur player must battl soldier snowman zombi giant crab alien mention huge screenfil bos guard five level shootanythingthatmov gameplay pepper moment oldschool geniu fan robot gastropod note titl refer instead vast array vehicl offer game stuf bizarr hardwar tank jet submarin command well cannontot camel eleph ostrich weaponri offer acr iraq dole justic joy thank ultra respons control tough nut crack addict enough gag one last go mere £ metal slug cheap slice fri spud man say cours ignor lack visual firework modern blaster time blockbust titl offer fresh lick paint favour real innov metal slug fresh gasp air era xbox even twinkl bill gate eye
1057,1097,internet boom for gift shopping cyberspace is becoming a very popular destination for christmas shoppers.  forecasts predict that british people will spend £4bn buying gifts online during the festive season  an increase of 64% on 2003. surveys also show that the average amount that people are spending is rising  as is the range of goods that they are happy to buy online. savvy shoppers are also using the net to find the hot presents that are all but sold out in high street stores.  almost half of the uk population now shop online according to figures collected by the interactive media in retail group which represents web retailers. about 85% of this group  18m people  expect to do a lot of their christmas gift buying online this year  reports the industry group. on average each shopper will spend £220 and britons lead europe in their affection for online shopping.  almost a third of all the money spent online this christmas will come out of british wallets and purses compared to 29% from german shoppers and only 4% from italian gift buyers. james roper  director of the imrg  said shoppers were now much happier to buy so-called big ticket items such as lcd television sets and digital cameras. mr roper added that many retailers were working hard to reassure consumers that online shopping was safe and that goods ordered as presents would arrive in time for christmas. he advised consumers to give shops a little more time than usual to fulfil orders given that online buying is proving so popular. a survey by hostway suggests that many men prefer to shop online to avoid the embarrassment of buying some types of presents  such as lingerie  for wives and girlfriends. much of this online shopping is likely to be done during work time  according to research carried out by security firm saint bernard software. the research reveals that up to two working days will be lost by staff who do their shopping via their work computer. worst offenders will be those in the 18-35 age bracket  suggests the research  who will spend up to five hours per week in december browsing and buying at online shops.  iggy fanlo  chief revenue officer at shopping.com  said that the growing numbers of people using broadband was driving interest in online shopping.  when you consider narrowband and broadband the conversion to sale is two times higher   he said. higher speeds meant that everything happened much faster  he said  which let people spend time browsing and finding out about products before they buy.  the behaviour of online shoppers was also changing  he said.  the single biggest reason people went online before this year was price   he said.  the number one reason now is convenience.   very few consumers click on the lowest price   he said.  they are looking for good prices and merchant reliability.  consumer comments and reviews were also proving popular with shoppers keen to find out who had the most reliable customer service. data collected by ebay suggests that some smart shoppers are getting round the shortages of hot presents by buying them direct through the auction site. according to ebay uk there are now more than 150 robosapiens remote control robots for sale via the site. the robosapiens toy is almost impossible to find in online and offline stores. similarly many shoppers are turning to ebay to help them get hold of the hard-to-find slimline playstation 2  which many retailers are only selling as part of an expensive bundle. the high demand for the playstation 2 has meant that prices for it are being driven up. in shops the ps2 is supposed to sell for £104.99. in some ebay uk auctions the price has risen to more than double this figure. many people are also using ebay to get hold of gadgets not even released in this country. the portable version of the playstation has only just gone on sale in japan yet some enterprising ebay users are selling the device to uk gadget fans.,internet boom gift

1061,722,no re-draft  for eu patent law a proposed european law on software patents will not be re-drafted by the european commission (ec) despite requests by meps.  the law is proving controversial and has been in limbo for a year. some major tech firms say it is needed to protect inventions  while others fear it will hurt smaller tech firms the ec says the council of ministers will adopt a draft version that was agreed upon last may but said it would review  all aspects of the directive . the directive is intended to offer patent protection to inventions that use software to achieve their effect  in other words   computer implemented invention .  in a letter  ec president jos&#233; manuel barroso told the president of the european parliament  josep borrell  that the commission  did not intend to refer a new proposal to the parliament and the council (of ministers)  as it had supported the agreement reached by ministers in may 2004.  if the european council agrees on the draft directive it will then return for a second reading at the european parliament. but that will not guarantee that the directive will become law - instead it will probably mean further delays and controversy over the directive. most eu legislation now needs the approval of both parliament and the council of ministers before it becomes law. french green mep alain lipietz warned two weeks ago that if the commission ignored the parliament s request it would be an  insult  to the assembly. he said that the parliament would then reject the council s version of the legislation as part of the final or conciliation stage of the decision procedure. in the us  the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted.  this means that the us-based amazon.com holds a patent for its  one-click shopping  service  for example. critics are concerned that the directive could lead to a similar model happening in europe. this  they fear  could hurt small software developers because they do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies if they had to fight patent legal action in court. supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up a playing field without bringing eu laws in line with the us.,redraft eu patent law propos european law softwar patent redraft european commiss ec despit request mep law prove controversi limbo year major tech firm say need protect invent other fear hurt small tech firm ec say council minist adopt draft version agre upon last may say would review aspect direct direct intend offer patent protect invent use softwar achiev effect word comput implement invent letter ec presid jo manuel barroso told presid european parliament josep borrel commiss intend refer new propos parliament council minist support agreement reach minist may european council agre draft direct return second read european parliament guarante direct becom law instead probabl mean delay controversi direct eu legisl need approv parliament council minist becom law french green mep alain lipietz warn two week ago commiss ignor parliament request would insult assembl say parliament would reject council version legisl part final concili stage decis procedur u patent comput program internet busi method permit mean usbas amazoncom hold patent oneclick shop servic exampl critic concern direct could lead similar model happen europ fear could hurt small softwar develop legal financi might large compani fight patent legal action court support say current law ineffici would serv even play field without bring eu law line u

1063,812,bp surges ahead on high oil price oil giant bp has announced a 26% rise in annual profits to $16.2bn (£8.7bn) on the back of record oil prices.  last week  rival shell reported an annual profit of $17.5bn - a record profit for a uk-listed company. bp added that it was increasing its fourth-quarter dividend by 26% to 8.5 cents  and that it would continue with share buybacks. bp chief executive lord browne said the results were strong  both operationally and financially.   the company is earning about $1.8m an hour.  despite the record annual profits figure  bp s performance was below the expectations of some city analysts. however  bp s share price rose 4p or nearly 1% in morning trading to 548p. its profit rise for the year included profits of $3.65bn (£1.97bn) for the final three months of 2004 - up from $2.89bn a year ago but below its third quarter.  speaking on the bbc s today programme on tuesday  lord browne said the profits were not solely down to the high oil price alone.   the profits are up more than the price of oil is up   he said. lord browne pointed out that bp was reaping the benefits of its investment in oil exploration.  we have spent many years buying (assets) when the price is low   he said. the company has made new discoveries in egypt  the gulf of mexico and angola.  however  lord browne rejected calls for a windfall tax on his company s huge profits  saying that in the north sea it paid progressively more tax  the more profits it made. lord browne believes oil prices will remain quite high. currently above $40 a barrel  he said:  the price of oil will be well supported above $30 a barrel for the medium term.  bp put production for the year at 3.997 billion barrels of oil  up 10% on 2003  but slightly lower than the four billion barrels it had initially aimed for.,bp surg ahead high oil price oil giant bp announc rise annual profit bn £bn back record oil price last week rival shell report annual profit bn record profit uklist compani bp ad increas fourthquart dividend cent would continu share buyback bp chief execut lord brown say result strong oper financi compani earn m hour despit record annual profit figur bp perform expect citi analyst howev bp share price rise p nearli morn trade p profit rise year includ profit bn £bn final three month bn year ago third quarter speak bbc today programm tuesday lord brown say profit sole high oil price alon profit price oil say lord brown point bp reap benefit invest oil explor spent mani year buy asset price low say compani make new discoveri egypt gulf mexico angola howev lord brown reject call windfal tax compani huge profit say north sea paid progress tax profit make lord brown believ oil price remain quit high current barrel say price oil well support barrel medium term bp put product year billion barrel oil slightli low four billion barrel initi aim

1068,2079,horror film heads us box office a low-budget horror film produced by evil dead director sam raimi has topped the north american box office.  boogeyman  which focuses on a man who returns to his childhood home to confront his traumatic past  took $19.5m (£14.9m) in three days. last week s chart-topper  the robert de niro thriller hide and seek  fell to number four. other new entries included the wedding date  a comedy starring will and grace s debra messing  at number two.  the road-trip comedy are we there yet  and multiple oscar nominee million dollar baby completed the top five. other oscar contenders  including the aviator and sideways  continued to perform strongly at the box office. the aviator has taken $75m (£40m) so far  while sideways has taken $46.8m (£24.8m) in a more limited release.  boogeyman  which cost just $7m (£3.5m) to make  performed well even though it was not screened to critics before release - normally a sign that a film will get bad reviews or perform poorly at the box office.  i certainly believe it s a genre where people are going to be more moved by the marketing materials for the movie than by what the critics say   said rory bruer  head of distribution for sony pictures  which released the film in the us. overall the weekend box office was strong despite the fact that it was american football s super bowl weekend - a time when cinema admissions generally fall. this year  the top 12 films grossed around $91m (£48.3m)  compared to 2004 s super bowl weekend when the total box office was $73.4m (£38.9m).,horror film head u box offic lowbudget horror film produc evil dead director sam raimi top north american box offic boogeyman focus man return childhood home confront traumat past take m £m three day last week charttopp robert de niro thriller hide seek fell number four new entri includ wed date comedi star grace debra mess number two roadtrip comedi yet multipl oscar nomine million dollar babi complet top five oscar contend includ aviat sideway continu perform strongli box offic aviat take m £m far sideway take m £m limit releas boogeyman cost m £m make perform well even though screen critic releas normal sign film get bad review perform poorli box offic certainli believ genr peopl go move market materi movi critic say say rori bruer head distribut soni pictur releas film u overal weekend box offic strong despit fact american footbal super bowl weekend time cinema admiss gener fall year top film gross around m £m compar super bowl weekend total box offic m £m
1069,341,looks and music to drive mobiles mobile phones are still enjoying a boom time in sales  according to research from technology analysts gartner.  more than 674 million mobiles were sold last year globally  said the report  the highest total sold to date. the figure was 30% more than in 2003 and surpassed even the most optimistic predictions  gartner said. good design and the look of a mobile  as well as new services such as music downloads  could go some way to pushing up sales in 2005  said analysts. although people were still looking for better replacement phones  there was evidence  according to gartner  that some markets were seeing a slow-down in replacement sales.   all the markets grew apart from japan which shows that replacement sales are continuing in western europe   mobile analyst carolina milanesi told the bbc news website.  japan is where north america and western european markets can be in a couple of years  time.  they already have tv  music  ringtones  cameras  and all that we can think of on mobiles  so people have stopped buying replacement phones.   but there could be a slight slowdown in sales in european and us markets too  according to gartner  as people wait to see what comes next in mobile technology. this means mobile companies have to think carefully about what they are offering in new models so that people see a compelling reason to upgrade  said gartner. third generation mobiles (3g) with the ability to handle large amounts of data transfer  like video  could drive people into upgrading their phones  but ms milanesi said it was difficult to say how quickly that would happen.  at the end of the day  people have cameras and colour screens on mobiles and for the majority of people out there who don t really care about technology the speed of data to a phone is not critical.  nor would the rush to produce two or three megapixel camera phones be a reason for mobile owners to upgrade on its own. the majority of camera phone models are not at the stage where they can compete with digital cameras which also have flashes and zooms.  more likely to drive sales in 2005 would be the attention to design and aesthetics  as well as music services. the motorola razr v3 phone was typical of the attention to design that would be more commonplace in 2005  she added. this was not a  women s thing   she said  but a desire from men and women to have a gadget that is a form of self-expression too. it was not just about how the phone functioned  but about what it said about its owner.  western europe has always been a market which is quite attentive to design   said ms milanesi.   people are after something that is nice-looking  and together with that  there is the entertainment side.  this year music will have a part to play in this.  the market for full-track music downloads was worth just $20 million (£10.5 million) in 2004  but is set to be worth $1.8 billion (£94 million) by 2009  according to juniper research. sony ericsson just released its walkman branded mobile phone  the w800  which combines a digital music player with up to 30 hours  battery life  and a two megapixel camera. in july last year  motorola and apple announced a version of itunes online music downloading service would be released which would be compatible with motorola mobile phones. apple said the new itunes music player would become motorola s standard music application for its music phones. but the challenge will be balancing storage capacity with battery life if mobile music hopes to compete with digital music players like the ipod. ms milanesi said more models would likely be released in the coming year with hard drives. but they would be more likely to compete with the smaller capacity music players that have around four gigabyte storage capacity  which would not put too much strain on battery life.,look music drive mobil mobil phone still enjoy boom time sale accord research technolog analyst

1071,758,qwest may spark mci bidding war us phone company qwest has said it will table a new offer for mci after losing out to larger rival verizon  setting the scene for a possible bidding war.  mci accepted a $6.75bn (£3.6bn) buyout from telecoms giant verizon on monday  rejecting a higher offer from qwest. qwest chairman richard notebaert sent a letter to mci s board on thursday saying that it plans to submit a new offer after examining verizon s bid. formerly known as worldcom  mci is a long-distance and corporate phone firm. snapping up mci would give the buyer access to a global telecommunications network and a large number of business-based subscribers. shares of mci were up more than 4% in electronic trading after the close of new york markets.  qwest said on wednesday that mci had rejected a deal worth $8bn.  we would like to advise you that once we have completed our review of the verizon merger agreement  we do intend to submit a modified offer to acquire mci   the letter from qwest said. verizon s offer is made up of cash  shares and dividends  and a number of investors have said that it undervalues mci. verizon plans to swap 0.41 of its shares and $1.50 in cash for each mci share  as well as offering special dividends of $4.50 a share. both company boards have backed the deal  but regulators will still need to give their approval. as well as trying to lure investors with the promise of better returns  qwest also reckons that its offer will face less regulatory scrutiny than verizon s.  the takeover would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since october as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases. earlier this month  sbc communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone trailblazer at&t for about $16bn. there may be concerns other than cash  however  especially as mci only emerged from bankruptcy protection last april. verizon is far bigger than qwest  has fewer debts and has built a successful mobile division. also  mci  while trading under the name worldcom  became the biggest corporate bankruptcy in us history after admitting that it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits. former worldcom boss bernie ebbers is currently standing trial  accused of overseeing an $11bn fraud. qwest  meanwhile  had to pay the securities and exchange commission $250m in october to settle charges that it massaged earnings to keep wall street happy.,qwest may spark mci bid war u phone compani qwest say tabl new offer mci lose large rival verizon set scene possibl bid war mci accept bn £bn buyout telecom giant verizon monday reject high offer qwest qwest chairman richard notebaert sent letter mci board thursday say plan submit new offer examin verizon bid formerli know worldcom mci longdist corpor phone firm snap mci would give buyer access global telecommun network larg number businessbas subscrib share mci electron trade close new york market qwest say wednesday mci reject deal worth bn would like advis complet review verizon merger agreement intend submit modifi offer acquir mci letter qwest say verizon offer make cash share dividend number investor say undervalu mci verizon plan swap share cash mci share well offer special dividend share compani board back deal regul still need give approv well tri lure investor promis well return qwest also reckon offer face less regulatori scrutini verizon takeov would fifth billiondollar telecom deal sinc octob compani look cut cost boost client base earlier month sbc commun agre buy former parent phone trailblaz att bn may concern cash howev especi mci emerg bankruptci protect last april verizon far big qwest few debt built success mobil divis also mci trade name worldcom becam big corpor bankruptci u histori admit illeg book expens inflat profit former worldcom bos berni ebber current stand trial accus overse bn fraud qwest meanwhil pay secur exchang commiss m octob settl charg massag earn keep wall street happi
1072,1834,us gives foreign firms extra time foreign firms have been given an extra year to meet tough new corporate governance regulations imposed by the us stock market watchdog.  the securities and exchange commission has extended the deadline to get in line with the rules until 15 july 2006. many foreign firms had protested that the sec was imposing an unfair burden. the new rules are the result of the sarbanes-oxley act  part of the us clean-up after corporate scandals such as enron and worldcom. section 404 of the sox act  as the legislation is nicknamed  calls for all firms to certify that their financial reporting is in line with us rules. big us firms already have to meet the requirements  but smaller ones and foreign-based firms which list their shares on us stock markets originally had until the middle of this year.  over the past few months  delegations of european and other business leaders have been heading to the sec s washington dc headquarters to protest. they say the burden is too expensive and the timescale too short and some  particularly the uk s cbi  warned that companies would choose to let their us listings drop rather than get in line with section 404. the latest delegation from the cbi met sec officials on wednesday  just before the decision to relax the deadline was announced.  i think this signifies a change of heart at the sec   cbi director-general sir digby jones told the bbc s today programme.  they have been listening to us and to many overseas companies  who have reminded america what globalisation really means: that they can t make these rules in isolation.  the sec said it had taken into consideration the fact that foreign companies were already working to meet more onerous financial reporting rules in their home countries. the european union  in particular  was imposing new international financial reporting standards in 2005  it noted.  i don t underestimate the effort (compliance) will require... but this extension will provide additional time for those issuers to take a good hard look at their internal controls   said donald nicolaisen  the sec s chief accountant.,u give foreign firm extra time foreign firm give extra year meet tough new corpor govern regul impos u stock market watchdog secur exchang commiss extend deadlin get line rule juli mani foreign firm protest sec impos unfair burden new rule result sarbanesoxley act part u cleanup corpor scandal enron worldcom section sox act legisl nicknam call firm certifi financi report line u rule big u firm alreadi meet requir small one foreignbas firm list share u stock market origin middl year past month deleg european busi leader head sec washington dc headquart protest say burden expens timescal short particularli uk cbi warn compani would choos let u list drop rather get line section late deleg cbi met sec offici wednesday decis relax deadlin announc think signifi chang heart sec cbi directorgener sir digbi jone told bbc today programm listen u mani oversea compani remind america globalis realli mean make rule isol sec say take consider fact foreign compani alreadi work meet oner financi report rule home countri european union particular impos new intern financi report standard note underestim effort complianc requir extens provid addit time issuer take good hard look intern control say donald nicolaisen sec chief account

1075,822,iranian mps threaten mobile deal turkey s biggest private mobile firm could bail out of a $3bn ($1.6bn) deal to build a network in iran after mps there slashed its stake in the project.  conservatives in parliament say turkcell s stake in irancell  the new network  should be cut from 70% to 49%. they have already given themselves a veto over all foreign investment deals  following allegations about turkish firms  involvement in israel. turkcell now says it may give up on the deal altogether.  iran currently has only one heavily congested mobile network  with long waiting lists for new subscribers. turkcell signed a contract for the new network in september. the new operator planned to offer subscriptions for about $180  well below the existing firm s $500 price tag. but a parliamentary commission has now ruled that turkcell s 70% controlling stake is too high. they say that turkcell is a security risk because of alleged business ties with israel. parliament as a whole - dominated by religious conservatives - will vote on the ruling on tuesday.  turkcell said the ruling would  make more difficult... turkcell s financial consolidation of irancell  because its stake would be reduced to less than 50%.  if management control and financial consolidation of irancell cannot be achieved... the realisation of the project will become risky   it warned in a statement. the firm has refused to comment on whether it has business dealings in israel  although like almost all gsm operators worldwide it has an interconnection deal with israeli networks so that its customers can use their phones there. the two countries strengthened ties in both defence and economic issues in 2004. israeli industry minister ehud olmert was reported in june to have attended a meeting between ruhi dogusoy  turkcell s chief operating officer  and executives from israeli telecoms firms. telecoms is one of two areas specifically targeted by the new veto law on foreign investments  passed earlier in september. the other is airports  a source of controversy after the army closed tehran s new imam khomeini international airport on its opening day in may 2004. again  the allegation was that the part-turkish tav consortium which built and ran it had links with israel.,iranian mp threaten mobil deal turkey big privat mobil firm could bail bn bn deal build network iran mp slash stake project conserv parliament say turkcel stake irancel new network cut alreadi give veto foreign invest deal follow alleg turkish firm involv israel turkcel say may give deal altogeth iran current one heavili congest mobil network long wait list new subscrib turkcel sign contract new network septemb new oper plan offer subscript well exist firm price tag parliamentari commiss rule turkcel control stake high say turkcel secur risk alleg busi tie israel parliament whole domin religi conserv vote rule tuesday turkcel say rule would make difficult turkcel financi consolid irancel stake would reduc less manag control financi consolid irancel achiev realis project becom riski warn statement firm refus comment whether busi deal israel although like almost gsm oper worldwid interconnect deal isra network custom use phone two countri strengthen tie defenc econom issu isra industri minist ehud olmert report june attend meet ruhi dogusoy turkcel chief oper offic execut isra telecom firm telecom one two area specif target new veto law foreign invest pas earlier septemb airport sourc controversi armi close tehran new imam khomeini intern airport open day may alleg partturkish tav consortium built ran link israel

1078,959,japan economy slides to recession the japanese economy has officially gone back into recession for the fourth time in a decade.  gross domestic product fell by 0.1% in the last three months of 2004. the fall reflects weak exports and a slowdown in consumer spending  and follows similar falls in gdp in the two previous quarters. the tokyo stock market fell after the figures were announced  but rose again on a widespread perception that the economy will recover later this year. on wednesday  the government revised growth figures from earlier in 2004 which  when taking into account performance in the most recent period  effectively tips japan into recession.  a previous estimate of 0.1% growth between july and september was downgraded to a 0.3% decline. a recession is commonly defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth  although the japanese government takes other factors into account when judging the status of its economy.  figures released by the government s cabinet office showed that gdp  on an annualised basis  fell 0.5% in the last three months of 2004. however  politicians remain upbeat about prospects for an economic boost later in the year.  the economy has some soft patches but if you look at the bigger picture  it is in a recovery stage   said economic and fiscal policy minister heizo takenaka. gross domestic product measures the overall value of goods and services produced in a country.  the economy must be assessed comprehensively and we cannot look at gdp alone   mr takenaka stressed.  ministers pointed to the fact that consumer spending had been depressed by one-off factors such as the unseasonably mild winter. analysts said the figures were disappointing but argued that japan s largest companies had been recording healthy profits and capital spending was on the rise. japan s economy grew 2.6% overall last year - fuelled by a strong performance in the first few months - and is forecast to see growth of 2.1% in 2005. however  the economy s fragile recovery remains dependent on an upturn in consumer spending  a fall in the value of the yen and an improvement in global economies.  the results came in at the lower end of expectations but we shouldn t be too pessimistic about the current state and the outlook for the economy   said naoki iizuka  senior economist at the dai-ichi life research institute. japan s economy has seen stretches of moderate growth over the past decade but has periodically slipped back into recession.,japan economi slide recess japanes economi offici go back recess fourth time decad gross domest product fell last three month fall reflect weak export slowdown consum spend follow similar fall gdp two previou quarter tokyo stock market fell figur announc rise widespread percept economi recov later year wednesday govern revis growth figur earlier take account perform recent period effect tip japan recess previou estim growth juli septemb downgrad declin recess commonli defin two consecut quarter neg growth although japanes govern take factor account judg statu economi figur releas govern cabinet offic show gdp annualis basi fell last three month howev politician remain upbeat prospect econom boost later year economi soft patch look big pictur recoveri stage say econom fiscal polici minist heizo takenaka gross domest product measur overal valu good servic produc countri economi must ass comprehens look gdp alon mr takenaka stress minist point fact consum spend depress oneoff factor unseason mild winter analyst say figur disappoint argu japan large compani record healthi profit capit spend rise japan economi grow overal last year fuell strong perform first month forecast see growth howev economi fragil recoveri remain depend upturn consum spend fall valu yen improv global economi result come low end expect pessimist current state outlook economi say naoki iizuka senior economist daiichi life research institut japan economi see stretch moder growth past decad period slip back recess

1084,1946,brazil approves bankruptcy reform a major reform of brazil s bankruptcy laws has been approved by the country s congress  in a move which it is hoped will cut the cost of borrowing.  the bill  proposed in 1993  has finally been approved by the leadership of president luiz inacio lula da silva. the old law  dating from 1945  gave priority first to workers  second to tax revenue and finally to creditors. the new legislation changes this  giving priority to creditors and limiting payments to workers. the new regulations will limit payments to workers to 150 times the minimum monthly salary  which is currently $94. the law also makes it more difficult for a company to declare bankruptcy. however  when a firm is declared bankrupt it will gain protection from creditors for 180 days while a recovery plan is worked out.  the proposals were opposed in the past by leftist parties  including mr lula s worker party. they considered that they undermined workers  rights. but president lula became a defender of the reforms  arguing that the country s bank lending margins were among the highest in the world and were damaging the economy. according to andreas adriano of latin trade magazine  the new bankruptcy law will help in reducing the spread - difference between the interest rates of the banks and federal bonds. nevertheless  mr adriano said to reduce the basic interest rate the central bank needs to change its policy  focusing not only on inflation but also on economic growth.,brazil approv bankruptci reform major reform brazil bankruptci law approv countri congress move hope cut cost borrow bill propos final approv leadership presid luiz inacio lula da silva old law date give prioriti first worker second tax revenu final creditor new legisl chang give prioriti creditor limit payment worker new regul limit payment worker time minimum monthli salari current law also make difficult compani declar bankruptci howev firm declar bankrupt gain protect creditor day recoveri plan work propos oppos past leftist parti includ mr lula worker parti consid undermin worker right presid lula becam defend reform argu countri bank lend margin among high world damag economi accord andrea adriano latin trade magazin new bankruptci law help reduc spread differ interest rate bank feder bond nevertheless mr adriano say reduc basic interest rate central bank need chang polici focus inflat also econom growth

1086,1433,fao warns on impact of subsidies billions of farmers  livelihoods are at risk from falling commodity prices and protectionism  the un s food & agriculture organisation has warned.  trade barriers and subsidies  severely  distort the market  the fao report on the  state of agricultural commodity markets 2004  said. as a result  the 2.5 billion people in the developing world who rely on farming face food insecurity. the most endangered are those who live in the least-developed countries. the fao report said that support for farmers in industrialised nations was equivalent to 30 times the amount provided as aid for agricultural development in poor countries.  the fao has urged the world trade organisation to swiftly conclude negotiations to liberalise trade  easing developing countries  access to the world market. it also criticised the high tariffs imposed by both developed and developing nations. it recommends that developing countries reduce their own tariffs to encourage trade and take advantage of market liberalisation.  according to the organisation  subsidies and high tariffs have a strong impact on the trade of products such as cotton and rice. global exports of these products are mainly in the hands of the european union and the us  who - thanks to subsidies - sell them at very low prices. in fact  almost 30 wealthy nations spend more than $300bn (£158.8bn; 230.9bn euros) in agricultural subsidies. the market situation has divided developing nations in two groups  the fao said. the first group have a reasonably diverse range of agricultural products while in the second group  agriculture lies largely in the hands of small-scale producers. for 43 developing countries  more than 20% of their export incomes come from the sale of just one product. these countries are mainly situated in sub-saharan africa  latin america and the caribbean.,fao warn impact subsidi billion farmer livelihood risk fall commod price protection un food agricultur organis warn trade barrier subsidi sever distort market fao report state agricultur commod market say result billion peopl develop world reli farm face food insecur endang live leastdevelop countri fao report say support farmer industrialis nation equival time amount provid aid agricultur develop poor countri fao urg world trade organis swiftli conclud negoti liberalis trade ea develop countri access world market also criticis high tariff impos develop develop nation recommend develop countri reduc tariff encourag trade take advantag market liberalis accord organis subsidi high tariff strong impact trade product cotton rice global export product mainli hand european union u thank subsidi sell low price fact almost wealthi nation spend bn £bn bn euro agricultur subsidi market situat divid develop nation two group fao say first group reason diver rang agricultur product second group agricultur lie larg hand smallscal produc develop countri export incom come sale one product countri mainli situat subsaharan africa latin america caribbean

1092,2089,o driscoll saves irish blushes two moments of magic from brian o driscoll guided ireland to a workmanlike victory against italy.  a pair of classic outside breaks from the ireland captain set up tries for geordan murphy and peter stringer. italy led 9-8 early in the second half but stringer s try gave ireland a lead they never lost. the hosts cut the gap to 18-12 with 10 minutes left and nearly scored through ludovico nitoglia  but denis hickie s try ensured an irish victory. italy came flying out of the blocks and took the lead through a luciano orquera penalty after seven minutes.  it could have been better for the hosts but the fly-half missed two kickable penalties and ireland drew level with a ronan o gara penalty midway through the first half. the italians were driving at the heart of the irish defence and  for the first quarter  the irish pack struggled to secure any ball for their talented backs.  when they finally did  just before the half-hour mark  o driscoll promptly created a sparkling try for murphy. the ireland captain ran a dummy scissors and made a magical outside break before drawing the full-back and putting the diving murphy in at the corner. o gara missed the twice-taken conversion and the visitors found themselves trailing once again. roland de marigny took over the kicking duties for italy from the hapless orquera  and he landed a penalty either side of the break to edge italy into a 9-8 lead.  the only ireland player offering a real threat was o driscoll  and it was his break that set up the second try for the visitors. shane horgan threw an overhead pass as he was about to be forced into touch and stringer scooted over  with o gara landing the tricky conversion. a penalty apiece saw ireland leading 18-12 as the game entered the final quarter  but they were lucky to survive when italy launched a series of attacks. winger nitoglia dropped the ball as he reached for the line and italy nearly rumbled over from a driving maul.  an o gara penalty put ireland more than a converted try ahead and they made the game safe when hickie latched onto an inside pass from murphy and crossed for a converted try. o driscoll limped off late on  joining centre partner gordon d arcy on the sidelines  and the final word went to italy. prop martin castrogiovanni powered over for a try which was fitting reward for an italian pack which had kept the irish under pressure throughout.  de marigny; mi bergamasco  canale  masi  nitoglia; orquera  troncon; lo cicero  ongaro  castrogiovanni; dellape  bortolami; persico  ma bergamasco  parisse.  perugini  intoppa  del fava  dal maso  griffen  pozzebon  robertson.  murphy  horgan  o driscoll  d arcy  hickie  o gara  stringer  corrigan  byrne  hayes  o kelly  o connell  s easterby  leamy  foley.  sheahan  horan  o callaghan  miller  g easterby  humphreys  dempsey.  p o brien (new zealand),driscol save irish blush two moment magic brian driscol guid ireland workmanlik victori itali pair classic outsid break ireland captain set tri geordan murphi peter stringer itali lead earli second half stringer tri give ireland lead never lose host cut gap minut left nearli score ludovico nitoglia deni hicki tri ensur irish victori itali come fli block take lead luciano orquera penalti seven minut could well host flyhalf miss two kickabl penalti ireland drew level ronan gara penalti midway first half italian drive heart irish defenc first quarter irish pack struggl secur ball talent back final halfhour mark driscol promptli creat sparkl tri murphi ireland captain ran dummi scissor make magic outsid break draw fullback put dive murphi corner gara miss twicetaken convers visitor found trail roland de marigni take kick duti itali hapless orquera land penalti either side break edg itali lead ireland player offer real threat driscol break set second tri visitor shane horgan threw overhead pas forc touch stringer scoot gara land tricki convers penalti apiec saw ireland lead game enter final quarter lucki surviv itali launch seri attack winger nitoglia drop ball reach line itali nearli rumbl drive maul gara penalti put ireland convert tri ahead make game safe hicki latch onto insid pas murphi cross convert tri driscol limp late join centr partner gordon arci sidelin final word go itali prop martin castrogiovanni power tri fit reward italian pack kept irish pressur throughout de marigni mi bergamasco canal masi nitoglia orquera troncon lo cicero ongaro castrogiovanni dellap bortolami persico bergamasco paris perugini intoppa del fava dal maso griffen pozzebon robertson murphi horgan driscol arci hicki gara stringer corrigan byrn hay kelli connel easterbi leami foley sheahan horan callaghan miller g easterbi humphrey dempsey p brien new zealand

1094,386,ukip s secret weapon  by any measure  new yorker dick morris is that thing americans love over everything else - a winner.  this is the man who  some pundits believe  was almost single-handedly responsible for bill clinton s sensational 1992 comeback victory. but morris is no ideologue. he has worked as election strategist for any number of republicans as well and  more recently  politicians from mexico to uruguay. now he is back in london as the uk independence party s not-so-secret electoral weapon after returning from the ukraine where he helped - you guessed it - opposition candidate viktor yushchenko. if there is one regular criticism levelled at morris  it is that he is too ready to switch allegiances. that he enjoys the game more than the politics.  so why britain and why ukip which  despite its recent eu election successes  is not likely to pull off a sensational victory in the looming general election. on this subject  morris appears almost evangelical.   i was on a cruise in the mediterranean and  coincidentally  so was ukip leader roger knapman.  i had just written a piece saying how the english channel was now wider than the atlantic which he liked and it went from there . but what is it about ukip that particularly attracts him  many might think it is simply another chance to practice his art  irrespective of the politics.  i think the greatest threat to democracy in the world is not terrorism but bureaucratism . a great soundbite  but a surprise coming from a new yorker post 11 september.  it is the growth of these bodies composed of experts who know better  who don t believe in letting democracy govern but believe in letting the correct solution be determined.  that s international bankers  the world trade organisation  the international monetary fund  the world bank and  primarily  the european union .  so he is out to help ukip take britain out of this organisation which he believes is unreformable and inherently undemocratic. and he is scathing of the tory party which he also appears to believe is unreformable.  the tory party is schizophrenic about europe. but until somebody says they are willing to leave the eu they can t possibly re-negotiate anything (as michael howard is pledged to do).  it s like walking into a liquor store with a gun to rob it and saying:  before i can proceed with the robbery i want to make clear i am not going to shoot anybody  . possibly a very american analogy  but another great soundbite.  the basic point is that the eu seeks political integration to move the entire nexus of decision making away from britain - and we oppose that and the tories cannot be trusted to oppose it .  so is ukip s job to destroy the tories  as former member robert kilroy-silk once notoriously declared   no. the aim of ukip is to withdraw from the eu and if it has any relation to the tories it is to stiffen the tories  spine on the issue by having a large enough ukip vote so that we move the tories in the direction they are refusing to move.   but it s not just to shift the tories. i think ukip had a huge amount to do with tony blair s decision to hold a referendum on the european constitution and i think it had a huge amount to do with his refusal to go into the euro . and  while we are on the subject of mr kilroy-silk  mr morris despatches him with another of his neat soundbites.  robert kilroy silk is not a team player - it is a good idea our party stands for some thing and not some one .  so what is the big plan for the general election. how will he achieve the breakthrough   look  we are not going to be forming the next government   he said. neither does ukip have to fight every seat. as with the 2004 us presidential election  he says  the outcome will be decided by a small number of swing seats - just as he believes it will in britain. so  with limited resources  the aim is to target those seats and end the day with a significant group in the commons. he also believes it is possible the internet could have a big part in the poll.  the internet was a decisive factor in the 2004 presidential election - through blogs (individuals posting their views in online diaries). people just did it .  anything can happen in the next general election. there is an inherent instability at the moment.  labour and the tories have drawn the consensus so tightly and to the left there is room for another voice .  that might  he suggests  lead to a hung parliament with ukip and others holding the balance of power. it is a huge task  surely. but there is undoubtedly a sense that the next general election may indeed produce some surprises - even while most still believe it is labour s for the taking. ukip s performance in last year s european elections was just such a shocker and showed that mr morris may have a point about the new consensus. and after all  he has a reputation to sustain.,ukip secret weapon measur new yorker dick morri thing american love everyth el winner man pundit believ almost singlehandedli respons bill clinton sensat comeback victori morri ideologu work elect strategist number republican well recent politician mexico uruguay back london uk independ parti notsosecret elector weapon return ukrain help guess opposit candid viktor yushchenko one regular critic level morri readi switch allegi enjoy game polit britain ukip despit recent eu elect success like pull sensat victori loom gener elect subject morri appear almost evangel cruis mediterranean coincident ukip leader roger knapman write piec say english channel wider atlant like go ukip particularli attract mani might think simpli anoth chanc practic art irrespect polit think great threat democraci world terror bureaucrat great soundbit surpris come new yorker post septemb growth bodi compos expert know well believ let democraci govern believ let correct solut determin intern banker world trade organis intern monetari fund world bank primarili european union help ukip take britain organis believ unreform inher undemocrat scath torus parti also appear believ unreform torus parti schizophren europ somebodi say will leav eu possibl renegoti anyth michael howard pledg like walk liquor store gun rob say proceed robberi want make clear go shoot anybodi possibl american analog anoth great soundbit basic point eu seek polit integr move entir nexu decis make away britain oppos torus trust oppos ukip job destroy torus former member robert kilroysilk notori declar aim ukip withdraw eu relat torus stiffen torus spine issu larg enough ukip vote move torus direct refus move shift torus think ukip huge amount toni blair decis hold referendum european constitut think huge amount refus go euro subject mr kilroysilk mr morri despatch anoth neat soundbit robert kilroy silk team player good idea parti stand thing one big plan gener elect achiev breakthrough look go form next govern say neither ukip fight everi seat u presidenti elect say outcom decid small number swing seat believ britain limit resourc aim target seat end day signific group common also believ possibl internet could big part poll internet decis factor presidenti elect blog individu post view onlin diari peopl anyth happen next gener elect inher instabl moment labour torus drawn consensu tightli left room anoth voic might suggest lead hung parliament ukip other hold balanc power huge task sure undoubtedli sen next gener elect may inde produc surpris even still believ labour take ukip perform last year european elect shocker show mr morri may point new consensu reput sustain

1098,1733,mobiles  not media players yet  mobiles are not yet ready to be all-singing  all-dancing multimedia devices which will replace portable media players  say two reports.  despite moves to bring music download services to mobiles  people do not want to trade multimedia services with size and battery life  said jupiter. a separate study by gartner has also said real-time tv broadcasts to mobiles is  unlikely  in europe until 2007. technical issues and standards must be resolved first  said the report. batteries already have to cope with other services that operators offer  like video playback  video messaging  megapixel cameras and games amongst others. bringing music download services based on the success of computer-based download services will put more demands on battery life.  fifty percent of europeans said the size of a mobile was the most important factor when it came to choosing their phone  but more power demands tend to mean larger handsets.  mobile phone music services must not be positioned to compete with the pc music experience as the handsets are not yet ready   said thomas husson  mobile analyst at jupiter research.  mobile music services should be new and different  and enable operators to differentiate their brands and support third generation network launches.  other problems facing mobile music include limited storage on phones  compared to portable players which can hold up to 40gb of music. the mobile industry is keen to get into music downloading  after the success of apple s itunes  napster and other net music download services.  with phones getting smarter and more powerful  there are also demands to be able to watch tv on the move. in the us  services like tivo to go let people transfer pre-recorded tv content onto their phones. but  the gartner report on mobile tv broadcasting in europe suggests direct broadcasting will have to wait. currently  tv-like services  where clips are downloaded  are offered by several european operators  like italy s tim and 3. mobile tv will have to overcome several barriers before it is widely taken up though  said the report.  various standards and ways of getting tv signals to mobiles are being worked on globally. in europe  trials in berlin and helsinki are making use of terrestrial tv masts to broadcast compressed signals to handsets with extra receivers. a service from the norwegian broadcasting corporation lets people watch tv programmes on their mobiles 24 hours a day. the service uses 3gp technology  one of the standards for mobile tv. but at the end of 2004  the european telecommunications institute (etsi) formally adopted digital video broadcasting handheld (dvb-h) as the mobile tv broadcasting standard for europe. operators will be working on the standard as a way to bring real-time broadcasts to mobiles  as well as trying to overcome several other barriers. the cost and infrastructure needs to set up the services will need to be addressed. handsets also need to be able to work with the dvb-h standard. tv services will have to live up to the expectations of the digital tv generation too  which expects good quality images at low prices  according to analysts. people are also likely to be put off watching tv on such small screens  said gartner. digital video recorders  like europe s sky+ box  and video-on-demand services mean people have much more control over what tv they watch. as a result  people may see broadcasting straight to mobiles as taking away that control. more powerful smartphones like the xda ii  nokia 6600  sonyericsson p900 and the orange e200  offering web access  text and multimedia messaging  e-mail  calendar and gaming are becoming increasingly common. a report by analysts instat/mdr has predicted that smartphone shipments will grow by 44% over the next five years. it says that smartphones will make up 117 million out of 833 million handsets shipped globally by 2009.,mobil medium player yet mobil yet readi

1099,984,india seeks to boost construction india has cleared a proposal allowing up to 100% foreign direct investment in its construction sector.  kamal nath  commerce and industry minister  announced the decision in delhi on thursday following a cabinet meeting. analysts say improving india s infrastructure will boost foreign investment in other sectors too. the indian government s decision has spread good cheer in the construction sector  according to some indian firms.  a spokesman for dlf builders  dr vancheshwar  told the bbc this will mean  better offerings  for consumers as well as builders. he said the firm will benefit from world class  strategic partnerships  design expertise and technology  while consumers will have better choice.   the government proposal states that foreign investment of up to 100% will be allowed on the  automatic route  in the construction sector  on projects including housing  hotels  resorts  hospitals and educational establishments. the automatic route means that construction companies need only get one set of official approvals and do not need to gain clearance from the foreign investment promotion board  which can be bureaucratic. the government hopes its new policy will create employment for construction workers  and benefit steel and brick-making industries.  mr nath also announced plans to allow foreign investors to develop a smaller area of any land they acquired.  foreign investors can enter any construction development area  be it to build resorts  townships or commercial premises but they will have to construct at least 50 000 square meters (538 000 square feet) within a specific timeframe   said mr nath  without specifying the timeframe. previously foreign investors had to develop a much larger area  discouraging some from entering the indian market. this measure is designed to discourage foreign investors from buying and selling land speculatively  without developing it. anshuman magazine  managing director  of cb richard ellis - an international real estate company - told the bbc this was  a big positive step.   however  chittabrata majumdar  general secretary of the centre of indian trade unions (citu)  said allowing fdi in the country is compromising india s own  self reliance . he said   no country can develop on the basis of foreign investment alone.  mr majumdar also said an assessment should be made as to whether foreign investment is indeed beneficial to the country - in terms of employment and money generated - or just another way of international companies filling their deep pockets.,india seek boost construct india clear propos allow foreign direct invest construct sector kamal nath commerc industri minist announc decis delhi thursday follow cabinet meet analyst say improv india infrastructur boost foreign invest sector indian govern decis spread good cheer construct sector accord indian firm spokesman dlf builder dr vancheshwar told bbc mean well offer consum well builder say firm benefit world class strateg partnership design expertis technolog consum well choic govern propos state foreign invest allow automat rout construct sector project includ hous hotel resort hospit educ establish automat rout mean construct compani need get one set offici approv need gain clearanc foreign invest promot board bureaucrat govern hope new polici creat employ construct worker benefit steel brickmak industri mr nath also announc plan allow foreign investor develop small area land acquir foreign investor enter construct develop area build resort township commerci premis construct least squar meter squar foot within specif timefram say mr nath without specifi timefram previous foreign investor develop much large area discourag enter indian market measur design discourag foreign investor buy sell land specul without develop anshuman magazin manag director cb richard elli intern real estat compani told bbc big posit step howev chittabrata majumdar gener secretari centr indian trade union citu say allow fdi countri compromis india self relianc say countri develop basi foreign invest alon mr majumdar also say ass make whether foreign invest inde benefici countri term employ money gener anoth way intern compani fill deep pocket
1100,2012,fiat mulls ferrari market listing ferrari could be listed on the stock market as part of an overhaul of fiat s carmaking operations  the financial times has reported.  it said fiat was set to restructure its business after reaching a $2bn (1.53bn euros; £1.05bn) settlement with gm about fiat s ownership. steps being considered include listing ferrari and bringing maserati and alfa romeo closer together  it said. despite strong sales of alfa romeo  fiat s car business is making a loss.  under the proposals - which the paper said could be announced within days - the iconic sportscar maker could be listed separately on the market. fiat owns a 56% stake in ferrari -best known for its dominant formula one motor racing team - having first bought into the business in 1969. it considered floating ferrari in 2002 but opted to sell a minority stake to italian bank mediobanca for 775m euros ($1bn). that sale valued ferrari - which owns the maserati brand - at 2.3bn euros. the price tag would change if maserati was stripped out. the financial times said fiat may transfer maserati within its wholly- owned alfa romeo division in an effort to exploit commercial synergies. such a move would help alfa romeo and maserati to share marketing  distribution and research & development costs. maserati and ferrari sell about 10 000 cars between them and both companies broke even in 2003.  fiat  italy s largest private sector employer  did not comment on the reported changes. fiat recently negotiated an end to its alliance with general motors. the us firm agreed to pay $2bn to exit an agreement under which it could have been liable to buy fiat outright. analysts said the reported restructuring was evidence of the greater flexibility which fiat now had to develop the business.,fiat mull ferrari market list ferrari could list stock market part overhaul fiat carmak oper financi time report say fiat set restructur busi reach bn bn euro £bn settlement gm fiat ownership step consid includ list ferrari bring maserati alfa romeo closer togeth say despit strong sale alfa romeo fiat car busi make loss propos paper say could announc within day icon sportscar maker could list separ market fiat own stake ferrari best know domin formula one motor race team first bought busi consid float ferrari opt sell minor stake italian bank mediobanca m euro bn sale valu ferrari own maserati brand bn euro price tag would chang maserati strip financi time say fiat may transfer maserati within wholli own alfa romeo divis effort exploit commerci synergi move would help alfa romeo maserati share market distribut research develop cost maserati ferrari sell car compani broke even fiat itali large privat sector employ comment report chang fiat recent negoti end allianc gener motor u firm agre pay bn exit agreement could liabl buy fiat outright analyst say report restructur evid great flexibl fiat develop busi

1102,1652,german bidder in talks with lse deutsche boerse bosses have held  constructive  professional and friendly  talks with the london stock exchange (lse)  its chief has said.  werner seifert met lse chief executive clara furse amid rumours the german group may raise its bid to £1.5bn ($2.9bn) from its initial £1.3bn offer. however  rival suitor euronext also upped the ante in the bid battle. ahead of talks with the lse on friday  the pan-european bourse said it may be prepared to make its offer in cash. the paris-based exchange  owner of liffe in london  is reported to be ready to raise £1.4bn to fund a bid.  the news came as deutsche boerse held its third meeting with the lse since its bid approach in december which was turned down by the london exchange for undervaluing the business. however  the lse did agree to leave the door open for talks to find out whether a  significantly-improved proposal  would be in the interests of lse s shareholders and customers. in the meantime  euronext  which combines the paris  amsterdam and lisbon stock exchanges  also began talks with the lse. in a statement on thursday  euronext said any offer was likely to be solely in cash  but added that:  there can be no assurances at this stage that any offer will be made.  a deal with either bidder would create the biggest stock market operator in europe and the second biggest in the world after the new york stock exchange. however  neither side has made a formal offer for the lse  with sources claiming such a step may still be weeks away.  deutsche boerse could also face mounting opposition to a bid at home. among sweeteners reported to have been discussed by mr seifert with ms furse were plans to move the management of its cash and eurex derivatives market to london  as well as two members of its executive board. but  hans reckers  a board member of germany s central bank  the bundesbank  said that cash trading should also remain in frankfurt  something deutsche boerse could move to the uk.  it is not just the headquarters of the boerse but also important market segments that must stay permanently in frankfurt. this has special importance for the business activities of the banks and the consultants   he said. local government officials in frankfurt s state of hessen have also spoken out against the move.  it is our wish that the headquarters stay here to maintain frankfurt s standing as the number one financial centre in continental europe   alois rhiel  its minister for economic affairs added.,german bidder talk lse deutsch boer bos held construct profession friendli talk london stock exchang lse chief say werner seifert met lse chief execut clara fur amid rumour german group may rais bid £bn bn initi £bn offer howev rival suitor euronext also up ant bid battl ahead talk lse friday paneuropean bours say may prepar make offer cash parisbas exchang owner liff london report readi rais £bn fund bid news come deutsch boer held third meet lse sinc bid approach decemb turn london exchang undervalu busi howev lse agre leav door open talk find whether significantlyimprov propos would interest lse sharehold custom meantim euronext combin pari amsterdam lisbon stock exchang also begin talk lse statement thursday euronext say offer like sole cash ad assur stage offer make deal either bidder would creat big stock market oper europ second big world new york stock exchang howev neither side make formal offer lse sourc claim step may still week away deutsch boer could also face mount opposit bid home among sweeten report discus mr seifert m fur plan move manag cash eurex deriv market london well two member execut board han recker board member germani central bank bundesbank say cash trade also remain frankfurt someth deutsch boer could move uk headquart boer also import market segment must stay perman frankfurt special import busi activ bank consult say local govern offici frankfurt state hessen also spoken move wish headquart stay maintain frankfurt stand number one financi centr continent europ aloi rhiel minist econom affair ad

1106,1254,chris evans back on the market broadcaster chris evans has begun selling thousands of his possessions from a stall in camden market  london.  evans perched on a stool as shoppers wandered around the open-fronted shop packed with his furniture. among the items from his homes in los angeles and london were countless sofas  chairs  pictures  beds and memorabilia from his past tv shows. asked the reason for the sale  evans said:  i just want to get rid of it all  it s just a headache.  he added:  it feels good to be selling this stuff  it s a weight off my mind.  look at it all  there s so much clutter. i ve enjoyed every bit of furniture and every poster but it s not important anymore.  the normally gregarious evans cut a peculiarly unshowbusiness-like figure as he sipped coffee and smoked cigarettes  wrapped in a big coat and scarf in front of his aladdin s cave.  however  the ostentation of some of the items on sale painted a picture of the eccentricity that endeared him to the british public in shows such as channel 4 s gameshow don t forget your toothbrush. the most striking thing about many of the pieces was their sheer size. sofas looked like they could seat a small party and a bed seemed big enough for four. the elaborate nature of the pieces  many custom-made  had to be admired  particularly a huge red and gold upholstered  throne  and a stripy deckchair from the queen mary liner.  to help people in their browsing  evans had given the pieces labels with not only the price but a helpful  often comic  aside.  isn t it great  was the comment on the £1 950 throne and  bob dylan s old sofa - honest  was written on a dark wood couch priced £4 250.  the prices were steep by a lot of people s standards but evans said it was not deterring shoppers.  i ve sold quite a lot already. everything here is on sale for less than i bought it for but it s not really about the money. it s about getting rid of it all. we ve all been bartering  that s what it s all about.  he added that he was not going to reveal what he was going to do with the money he was making. vintage tv and film posters also lined the walls  including a rare portrait of raquel welch and an original advertising print from the benny hill show. and  almost hidden at the back of the lock-up  were the two giant toothbrushes from his former channel 4 show  although these were not for sale.  despite the sheer curiosity value of the sale  there was a healthy trickle of interest from the public rather than the perhaps expected crowds. some wandered in just to browse  as they would any of the other stalls  not knowing that it belonged to evans.  paul burgess said:  i didn t realise. i thought it was just a load of junk. i should go back and have a better look.  but local resident francesca detakats came specially to the stall and left happy with her purchase of an original 1960s photograph of the who by david wedgburg. ms detakats said she was a collector and did not mind paying £350 for the print.  if you like something  you don t really count it like that   she said.  martin hellewell  who had also made a point of visiting evans  shop  said he thought it was a great idea.  why not  if you ve got stuff to get rid of it s a good place to do it   said mr hellewell. evans has taken out the stall with business partner pete winterbottom. they plan to open every day if possible  although evans did not know how often he would be there.  we ll stay definitely until christmas and then maybe a week after that   said evans.,chri evan back market broadcast chri evan begin sell thousand posse stall camden market london evan perch stool shopper wander around openfront shop pack furnitur among item home lo angel london countless sofa chair pictur bed memorabilia past tv show ask reason sale evan say want get rid headach ad feel good sell stuff weight mind look much clutter enjoy everi bit furnitur everi poster import anymor normal gregari evan cut peculiarli unshowbusinesslik figur sip coffe smoke cigarett wrap big coat scarf front aladdin cave howev ostent item sale paint pictur eccentr endear british public show channel gameshow forget toothbrush strike thing mani piec sheer size sofa look like could seat small parti bed seem big enough four elabor natur piec mani custommad admir particularli huge red gold upholst throne stripi deckchair queen mari liner help peopl brow evan give piec label price help often comic asid great comment £ throne bob dylan old sofa honest write dark wood couch price £ price steep lot peopl standard evan say deter shopper sell quit lot alreadi everyth sale less bought realli money get rid barter ad go reveal go money make vintag tv film poster also line wall includ rare portrait raquel welch origin advertis print benni hill show almost hidden back lockup two giant toothbrush former channel show although sale despit sheer curio valu sale healthi trickl interest public rather perhap expect crowd wander brow would stall know belong evan paul burgess say realis thought load junk go back well look local resid francesca detakat come special stall left happi purchas origin s photograph david wedgburg m detakat say collector mind pay £ print like someth realli count like say martin hellewel also make point visit evan shop say thought great idea get stuff get rid good place say mr hellewel evan take stall busi partner pete winterbottom plan open everi day possibl although evan know often would stay definit christma mayb week say evan

1109,1425,can smith work scottish wonders  the worst kept secret in scottish football was revealed on thursday when walter smith was named as the new national manager.  from the moment berti vogts  miserable tenure in charge of scotland ended  the former rangers and everton boss has been the overwhelming favourite for the post. but is smith the man for what must be one of the hardest jobs in football  the 56-year-old takes over at a time when the national side is in the doldrums. scotland have not reached a major finals since the world cup in 1998 and reaching germany 2006 looks near impossible  having picked up just two points from the opening three games in the qualifying race. and the fifa rankings see scotland listed at an all time low of 77th  below the likes of estonia  ghana  angola and thailand. scotland are not blessed with quality players with experience at the top level  so smith will have to get the best out of meagre resources. smith s track record make impressive reading and he is widely respected within the game. the man who was alex ferguson s assistant when scotland played at the 1986 world cup won seven league titles with rangers. and his appointment has been widely endorsed by many of the games  top names  including ferguson and graeme souness  who took him to ibrox as his assistant in 1986. characters like souness  ferguson and current ibrox manager alex mcleish all cite smith s experience and his expansive knowledge of the scottish game.  much was made of vogts  inability to express himself to the players and media. that will certainly not be the case with smith. the former dundee united and dumbarton full-back is from the managerial old school - straight talking and never slow to let players know when he expects better (often with the use of some colourful invective). but it should be remembered vogts came to scotland with an impressive curriculum vitae - a world cup winner as a player and a european championships winner as a manager. smith will inherit the same problems vogts had - a callow squad of players with no exceptional talents. and it remains to be seen if smith will experience the rash of call-offs that blighted so much of vogts  preparation work. a fresh start for the scottish national team was imperative and smith is widely regarded as a safe pair of hands. but will a safe pair of hands be enough when the adroit hands of a magician might be required...,smith work scottish wonder bad kept secret scottish footbal reveal thursday walter smith name new nation manag moment berti vogt miser tenur charg scotland end former ranger everton bos overwhelm favourit post smith man must one hardest job footbal yearold take time nation side doldrum scotland reach major final sinc world cup reach germani look near imposs pick two point open three game qualifi race fifa rank see scotland list time low th like estonia ghana angola thailand scotland bless qualiti player experi top level smith get best meagr resourc smith track record make impress read wide respect within game man alex ferguson assist scotland play world cup seven leagu titl ranger appoint wide endors mani game top name includ ferguson graem souness take ibrox assist charact like souness ferguson current ibrox manag alex mcleish cite smith experi expans knowledg scottish game much make vogt inabl express player medium certainli case smith former dunde unit dumbarton fullback manageri old school straight talk never slow let player know expect well often use colour invect rememb vogt come scotland impress curriculum vita world cup winner player european championship winner manag smith inherit problem vogt callow squad player except talent remain see smith experi rash calloff blight much vogt prepar work fresh start scottish nation team imper smith wide regard safe pair hand safe pair hand enough adroit hand magician might requir

1111,2170,goldsmith denies war advice claim the attorney general has denied his statement to parliament about the legality of the iraq war was drafted by downing street officials.  lord goldsmith said lord falconer and baroness morgan played no part in drafting the answer. he added the answer represented his view that the war was legal  but was not a summary of his advice to the pm. the government has resisted calls to publish the full advice  saying such papers are always kept confidential.  in a statement  lord goldsmith said:  i was fully involved throughout the drafting process and personally finalised  and of course approved  the answer.  he said the answer had been prepared in his office with the involvement of solicitor general harriet harman  two of his own officials  three foreign office officials  a qc  christopher greenwood and the then lord chancellor  lord irvine of lairg.   no other minister or official was involved in any way.  he suggested the claim that lord falconer and lady morgan had drafted the answer were the result of a mis-transcription of his evidence to the butler inquiry into pre-war intelligence.  as i have always made clear  i set out in the answer my own genuinely held  independent view that military action was lawful under the existing (un) security council resolutions   he said.  the answer did not purport to be a summary of my confidential legal advice to government.  former foreign secretary robin cook said lord goldsmith s admission that his parliamentary answer was not a summary of his legal opinion suggested parliament may have been misled.  the attorney general may never have presented his answer as a summary  but others certainly did   he said.  what is clear from his statement today is that he does not believe that it was a full  accurate summary of his formal opinion.   earlier  tony blair dismissed questions about the attorney general s advice  and said his parliamentary statement had been a  fair summary  of his opinion.  that s what he (lord goldsmith) said and that s what i say. he has dealt with this time and time and time again   mr blair told his monthly news conference in downing street. he refused to answer further questions on the issue.  on the question of whether such papers have always been kept confidential  tory mp michael mates  who is a member of the commons intelligence and security committee and was part of the butler inquiry  told the bbc:  that  as a general rule  is right  but it s not an absolute rule.  he said there had been other occasions when advice had been published  most recently regarding prince charles s marriage plans. the government could not pick and choose when to use the convention  he said. mr mates added:  this may be one of those special occasions... when it would be in the public interest to see the advice which the attorney general gave to the prime minister.   the claims about lord falconer and baroness morgan s involvement were made in a book published this week by philippe sands qc  a member of cherie blair s matrix chambers. he also says lord goldsmith warned tony blair on 7 march 2003 that the iraq war could be illegal without a second un resolution sanctioning military action.  a short statement about lord goldsmith s position presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 march 2003 - just before a crucial commons vote on the military action - did not suggest this. former minister clare short  who resigned from the government over the iraq war  said the ministerial answer was the same statement that was earlier shown to the cabinet as it discussed military action. she said the full advice should have been attached  according to the ministerial code  and demanded a lords inquiry into the matter. the conservatives and liberal democrats say they still want the publication of the full legal advice given by the attorney general. lib dem foreign affairs spokesman sir menzies campbell said lord goldsmith s statement still did not clear up the outstanding issues.  if his original advice of 7 march accepted that military action might be illegal  how was it that he resolved any such doubts by the time the parliamentary answer was published on 17 march   he said.  only the fullest disclosure will now do.,goldsmith deni war advic claim attorney gener deni statement parliament legal iraq war draft down street offici lord goldsmith say lord falcon baro morgan play part draft answer ad answer repres view war legal summari advic pm govern resist call publish full advic say paper alway kept confidenti statement lord goldsmith say fulli involv throughout draft process person finalis cours approv answer say answer prepar offic involv solicitor gener harriet harman two offici three foreign offic offici qc christoph greenwood lord chancellor lord irvin lairg minist offici involv way suggest claim lord falcon ladi morgan draft answer result mistranscript evid butler inquiri prewar intellig alway make clear set answer genuin held independ view militari action law exist un secur council resolut say answer purport summari confidenti legal advic govern former foreign secretari robin cook say lord goldsmith admiss parliamentari answer summari legal opinion suggest parliament may misl attorney gener may never present answer summari other certainli say clear statement today believ full accur summari formal opinion earlier toni blair dismiss question attorney gener advic say parliamentari statement fair summari opinion lord goldsmith say say dealt time time time mr blair told monthli news confer down street refus answer question issu question whether paper alway kept confidenti torus mp michael mate member common intellig secur committe part butler inquiri told bbc gener rule right absolut rule say occas advic publish recent regard princ charl marriag plan govern could pick choos use convent say mr mate ad may one special occas would public interest see advic attorney gener give prime minist claim lord falcon baro morgan involv make book publish week philipp sand qc member cheri blair matrix chamber also say lord goldsmith warn toni blair march iraq war could illeg without second un resolut sanction militari action short statement lord goldsmith posit present write parliamentari answer march crucial common vote militari action suggest former minist clare short resign govern iraq war say ministeri answer statement earlier show cabinet discus militari action say full advic attach accord ministeri code demand lord inquiri matter conserv liber democrat say still want public full legal advic give attorney gener lib dem foreign affair spokesman sir menzi campbel say lord goldsmith statement still clear outstand issu origin advic march accept militari action might illeg resolv doubt time parliamentari answer publish march say full disclosur
1112,193,blair  said he would stand down  tony blair promised gordon brown he would stand down before the next election  a new book about the chancellor claims.  but the prime minister changed his mind following intervention from allies in the cabinet  according to the book. the book by sunday telegraph journalist robert peston said the pair had  mutual animosity and contempt  for each other. the book  brown s britain  said tony blair felt by november 2003 he had lost voters  trust.  the author s sources  all unnamed  allies  of mr blair and mr brown  said the prime minister felt the iraq war had undermined him and that he was no longer an asset to the labour party.  the book  serialised in the sunday telegraph  alleges that mr blair told the chancellor at a dinner hosted by deputy pm john prescott in november 2003 of his intention to stand down.  at that stage he saw gordon brown and said   look you are the next most influential member of the government  i need your help to get through the next year   mr peston said.  i myself recognise that i m going to have to stand down before the election but help me to get through the year and i will then stand down.   but he changed his mind in june 2004  following intervention from allies in the cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him  the book claims.  mr peston told bbc news:  my understanding is that they are not nearly as close or as friendly as they once were.  what the book says is there now a pretty profound mutual mistrust  mutual animosity.  i think in public you see this double act pretending everything is alright but in private i don t think the relationship is good because brown  understandably  feels deeply betrayed - particularly over this issue of the leadership.  there has been fresh speculation of a rift recently  following their separate responses to the asian tsunami. rumours of a rift were fuelled by the sudden decision to hold mr blair s monthly media conference at the same time as a long-planned speech by mr brown on uk plans to tackle global poverty with a new  marshall plan  for africa. there was speculation the pair were trying to outdo each other s response to the disaster.  former welfare minister frank field mp criticised the reported rivalry between the pair on gmtv s sunday programme.   what sort of model does it give to the nation when the two most important political leaders do nothing but fight it out together or use their aides to fight it out   the labour mp for birkenhead asked. he said the prime minister should sack mr brown  but did not believe mr blair was strong enough to do so. conservative policy co-ordinator david cameron  mp for witney  added:  if it wasn t so serious it would be funny.  but it is serious - you ve got the two most senior people in the government not concentrating on fighting crime  poverty or dirty hospitals - they are fighting each other.  carol walker  bbc news 24 political correspondent  added:  there is a real concern that this could undermine the general election campaign.  and clearly it is very bad news for the government at a time when it is trying to explain what it is doing to respond to the terrible problems thrown up by the tsunami disaster.,blair say would stand toni blair promis gordon brown would stand next elect new book chancellor claim prime minist chang mind follow intervent alli cabinet accord book book sunday telegraph journalist robert peston say pair mutual animos contempt book brown britain say toni blair felt novemb lose voter trust author sourc unnam alli mr blair mr brown say prime minist felt iraq war undermin longer asset labour parti book serialis sunday telegraph alleg mr blair told chancellor dinner host deputi pm john prescott novemb intent stand stage saw gordon brown say look next influenti member govern need help get next year mr peston say recognis go stand elect help get year stand chang mind june follow intervent alli cabinet suspicion chancellor deliber manoeuvr book claim mr peston told bbc news understand nearli close friendli book say pretti profound mutual mistrust mutual animos think public see doubl act pretend everyth alright privat think relationship good brown understand feel deepli betray particularli issu leadership fresh specul rift recent follow separ respons asian tsunami rumour rift fuell sudden decis hold mr blair monthli medium confer time longplan speech mr brown uk plan tackl global poverti new marshal plan africa specul pair tri outdo respons disast former welfar minist frank field mp criticis report rivalri pair gmtv sunday programm sort model give nation two import polit leader noth fight togeth use aid fight labour mp birkenhead ask say prime minist sack mr brown believ mr blair strong enough conserv polici coordin david cameron mp witney ad seriou would funni seriou get two senior peopl govern concentr fight crime poverti dirti hospit fight carol walker bbc news polit correspond ad real concern could undermin gener elect campaign clearli bad news govern time tri explain respond terribl problem thrown tsunami disast
1113,111,us trade gap hits record in 2004 the gap between us exports and imports hit an all-time high of $671.7bn (£484bn) in 2004  latest figures show.  the commerce department said the trade deficit for all of last year was 24.4% above the previous record - 2003 s imbalance of $496.5bn. the deficit with china  up 30.5% at $162bn  was the largest ever recorded with a single country. however  on a monthly basis the us trade gap narrowed by 4.9% in december to £56.4bn. the us consumer s appetite for all things from oil to imported cars  and even wine and cheese  reached record levels last year and the figures are likely to spark fresh criticism of president bush s economic policies.  democrats claim the administration has not done enough to clamp down on unfair foreign trade practices. for example  they believe china s currency policy - which us manufacturers claim has undervalued the yuan by as much as 40% - has given china s rapidly expanding economy an unfair advantage against us competitors.  meanwhile  the bush administration argues that the us deficit reflects the fact the america is growing at faster rate than the rest of the world  spurring on more demand for imported goods. some economists say this may allow an upward revision of us economic growth in the fourth quarter. but others point out that the deficit has reached such astronomical proportions that foreigners many choose not to hold as many dollar-denominated assets  which may in turn harm growth. for all of 2004  us exports rose 12.3% to $1.15 trillion  but imports rose even faster by 16.3% to a new record of $1.76 trillion. foreign oil exports surged by 35.7% to a record $180.7bn  reflecting the rally in global oil prices and increasing domestic demand. imports were not affected by the dollar s weakness last year.  we expect the deficit to continue to widen in 2005 even if the dollar gets back to its downward trend   said economist marie-pierre ripert at ixis.,u trade gap hit record gap u export import hit alltim high bn £bn late figur show commerc depart say trade deficit last year previou record imbal bn deficit china bn large ever record singl countri howev monthli basi u trade gap narrow decemb £bn u consum appetit thing oil import car even wine chees reach record level last year figur like spark fresh critic presid bush econom polici democrat claim administr do enough clamp unfair foreign trade practic exampl believ china currenc polici u manufactur claim undervalu yuan much give china rapidli expand economi unfair advantag u competitor meanwhil bush administr argu u deficit reflect fact america grow faster rate rest world spur demand import good economist say may allow upward revis u econom growth fourth quarter other point deficit reach astronom proport foreign mani choos hold mani dollardenomin asset may turn harm growth u export rise trillion import rise even faster new record trillion foreign oil export surg record bn reflect ralli global oil price increas domest demand import affect dollar weak last year expect deficit continu widen even dollar get back downward trend say economist mariepierr ripert ixi
1114,833,tories pledge free sports lessons children would be offered two hours  free sports training a week by a future tory government  the party has said.  the club2school policy would provide up to £250m yearly for local sports clubs in the uk to deliver after-school sport. the extra coaching would be funded by the national lottery and would come on top of the two hours of sport a week children are supposed to get in school. shadow home secretary david davis said five million children were being denied adequate sporting opportunities.  the plans would help tackle the  fastest growing rate of obesity in the developed world   he said. shadow sports minister lord moynihan said the policy would empower local clubs and create a lasting legacy.  we aim to shift the emphasis on after-school sport provision away from our overstretched teachers and schools directly in to the 151 000 sports clubs in the uk.  the tories say labour s plans to give all children two hours of sports lessons a week in schools have failed. government figures show that in england in 2002 only a third of schools at key stages 1  3 and 4 and two-fifths of schools at key stage 2  met that target. the tories also claim that of the £750m the prime minister pledged in 2000 to invest on school sports facilities  only £41m had been spent. but the big lottery fund has said that complex capital projects are involved - and it was confident the money would all be allocated by next year as intended.,torus pledg free sport lesson child would offer two hour free sport train week futur torus govern parti say clubschool polici would provid £m yearli local sport club uk deliv afterschool sport extra coach would fund nation lotteri would come top two hour sport week child suppos get school shadow home secretari david davi say five million child deni adequ sport opportun plan would help tackl fast grow rate obes develop world say shadow sport minist lord moynihan say polici would empow local club creat last legaci aim shift emphasi afterschool sport provis away overstretch teacher school directli sport club uk torus say labour plan give child two hour sport lesson week school fail govern figur show england third school key stage twofifth school key stage met target torus also claim £m prime minist pledg invest school sport facil £m spent big lotteri fund say complex capit project involv confid money would alloc next year intend
1115,2206,dance music not dead says fatboy dj norman cook - aka fatboy slim - has said that dance music is not dead  but has admitted it is currently going through a  fallow patch .  the commercial failure of the latest albums by britain s two biggest dance acts - fatboy slim s palookaville and the prodigy s always outnumbered never outgunned - has been coupled with the closure of many  superclubs   and the folding of three dance music magazines. last month the brit awards announced they would no longer be awarding a best dance act prize  with the brits committee announcing that  dance music is no longer where it s happening in music.  these developments lead some to suggest that dance was finished as a popular music genre. cook acknowledged that much change in the dance world in the four years since his last album  halfway between the gutter and the stars  but he stressed this did not mean the dance scene was permanently over.  every week when i was making the album  i was reading articles about the demise of dance music - and obviously that affects you somewhat   he told bbc world service s the ticket programme.  i personally don t believe it s either dead or going to die  but it s going through a bit of a fallow patch.  so i think  consciously or subconsciously  reading every week that dance music was dead i would think  right  scrub that track then .   although his album sales in the uk are down - palookaville stayed in the uk top 75 for just three weeks - cook has achieved recent global success with his beach parties. and event on brighton sea front in 2002 attracted 250 000  people  while a later one in rio achieved a crowd of 360 000. the dvd of the rio set was the biggest seller of that year.   with a crowd that big  if the weather s nice  the atmosphere before i even go is so good that about halfway through the first record i think  i ve got them    cook said.  i m always really really nervous before the big ones - they had to give me valium before rio  because two hours before i was literally just pacing the floor.  for some reason  especially now i ve got a reputation for it  the atmosphere and the joie de vivre that s already going on means all i have to do is play  up  records.  he promised more such parties in more locations around the world - despite problems after the brighton event  which ended in chaos with many revellers finding themselves stranded as transport ground to a halt. one man also died of a heart attack  and a woman fell to her death during the free party.  we re having to widen our horizons from just beaches  because there s landlocked countries that want to get involved   cook said.  we re doing rio at the carnival  at the maracana  and sao paolo - our new gig is famous football stadiums.   the dj admitted  however  that his massive worldwide success had a downside  with intense media interest in his personal life. in particular  he said he had struggled to cope with tabloid intrusion during the temporary break-up of his marriage to radio one presenter zoe ball  after she was linked with dj dan peppe.   the tabloid thing has been difficult at times   cook said.  especially the me-and-zoe-gate - it s quite scary.  he said that he had been  determined  that what had happened with ball did not affect the album.  at first i was doing deliberately jolly tunes so that people wouldn t think i was depressed   he explained.  then i thought   that s not right .  and he highlighted a bizarre coincidence - that one song written before they split had turned out to have a great deal more meaning than intended.  i said to zoe   i did this track called my masochistic baby went and left me  do you mind if it s on the album    he recalled.  she said   yeah  it s hilarious  because your masochistic baby did leave you .  cook also added that he had some ways of coping with the intense paparazzi pressure  which accumulates at the end of the private road he lives on - where paul mccartney is a neighbour.  it s almost like prisoners rattling the bars with their mugs   cook explained.  if there s a pap at the end of the road  everyone knocks on each other s doors - paul comes round  and we warn him  because we don t know who they re after.,danc music dead say fatboy dj norman cook aka fatboy slim say danc music dead admit current go fallow patch commerci failur late album britain two big danc act fatboy slim palookavil prodigi alway outnumb never outgun coupl closur mani superclub fold three danc music magazin last month brit award announc would longer award best danc act prize brit committe announc danc music longer happen music develop lead suggest danc finish popular music genr cook acknowledg much chang danc world four year sinc last album halfway gutter star stress mean danc scene perman everi week make album read articl demis danc music obvious affect somewhat told bbc world servic ticket programm person believ either dead go die go bit fallow patch think conscious subconsci read everi week danc music dead would think right scrub track although album sale uk palookavil stay uk top three week cook achiev recent global success beach parti event brighton sea front attract peopl later one rio achiev crowd dvd rio set big seller year crowd big weather nice atmospher even go good halfway first record think get cook say alway realli realli nervou big one give valium rio two hour liter pace floor reason especi get reput atmospher joie de vivr alreadi go mean play record promis parti locat around world despit problem brighton event end chao mani revel find strand transport ground halt one man also die heart attack woman fell death free parti widen horizon beach landlock countri want get involv cook say rio carniv maracana sao paolo new gig famou footbal stadium dj admit howev massiv worldwid success downsid intens medium interest person life particular say struggl cope tabloid intrus temporari breakup marriag radio one present zoe ball link dj dan pepp tabloid thing difficult time cook say especi meandzoeg quit scari say determin happen ball affect album first deliber jolli tune peopl think depress explain thought right highlight bizarr coincid one song write split turn great deal mean intend say zoe track call masochist babi go left mind album recal say yeah hilari masochist babi leav cook also ad way cope intens paparazzo pressur accumul end privat road live paul mccartney neighbour almost like prison rattl bar mug cook explain pap end road everyon knock door paul come round warn know
1116,759,greek pair attend drugs hearing greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou have appeared before an independent tribunal which will decide if their bans should stand.  they were given provisional suspensions by athletics  ruling body the iaaf in december for failing to take drugs tests before the athens olympics. the pair arrived with former coach christos tzekos to give evidence at the hellenic olympic committee s offices. a decision is expected to be announced before the end of february. whatever the ruling  all parties will have the right to appeal to the court of arbitration for sport. yiannis papadoyiannakis  who was head of the greek olympic team at the athens games last year  also testified at the tribunal  along with other greek sports officials and athletes.  i believe the tribunal will reach a decision that will uphold the standing of the institution   said papadoyiannakis.  whatever the athletes have done  we must not forget that they have offered us great moments.  kenteris won 200m gold at the 2000 sydney olympics  while thanou won silver in the 100m.  they withdrew from the athens games last august after missing drugs tests on the eve of the opening ceremony. the pair spent four days in a hospital  claiming they had been injured in a motorcycle crash. the five-member tribunal  assembled by the hellenic association of amateur athletics  is also examining allegations that kenteris and thanou avoided tests in tel aviv and chicago before the games. tzekos was also banned for two years by the iaaf. he faces charges of assisting in the use of prohibited substances and tampering with the doping inspection process. all three  who have repeatedly denied the allegations  have also been charged by a greek prosecutor and face trial for doping-related charges. a trial date has not been set. in imposing two-year suspensions on the duo on 22 december  the iaaf described their explanations for missing the tests as  unacceptable . but kenteris  lawyer gregory ioannidis told bbc sport earlier this week he was confident the sprinters would be cleared of the charges of failing to give information on their location and refusing to submit to testing.  we refute both charges as unsubstantiated and illogical   he said.  there have been certain breaches in the correct application of the rules on behalf of the sporting authorities and their officials  and these procedural breaches have also violated my client s rights.  there is also evidence that proves the fact that my client has been persecuted.,greek pair attend drug hear greek sprinter kosta kenteri katerina thanou appear independ tribun decid ban stand give provision suspens athlet rule bodi iaaf decemb fail take drug test athen olymp pair arriv former coach christo tzeko give evid hellen olymp committe offic decis expect announc end februari whatev rule parti right appeal court arbitr sport yianni papadoyiannaki head greek olymp team athen game last year also testifi tribun along greek sport offici athlet believ tribun reach decis uphold stand institut say papadoyiannaki whatev athlet do must forget offer u great moment kenteri m gold sydney olymp thanou silver m withdrew athen game last august miss drug test eve open ceremoni pair spent four day hospit claim injur motorcycl crash fivememb tribun assembl hellen associ amateur athlet also examin alleg kenteri thanou avoid test tel aviv chicago game tzeko also ban two year iaaf face charg assist use prohibit substanc tamper dope inspect process three repeatedli deni alleg also charg greek prosecutor face trial dopingrel charg trial date set impos twoyear suspens duo decemb iaaf describ explan miss test unaccept kenteri lawyer gregori ioannidi told bbc sport earlier week confid sprinter would clear charg fail give inform locat refus submit test refut charg unsubstanti illog say certain breach correct applic rule behalf sport author offici procedur breach also violat client right also evid prove fact client persecut
