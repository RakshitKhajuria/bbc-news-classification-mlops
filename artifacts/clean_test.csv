2,302,fox attacks blair s tory  lies  tony blair lied when he took the uk to war so has no qualms about lying in the election campaign  say the tories.  tory co-chairman liam fox was speaking after mr blair told labour members the tories offered a  hard right agenda . dr fox told bbc radio:  if you are willing to lie about the reasons for going to war  i guess you are going to lie about anything at all.  he would not discuss reports the party repaid £500 000 to lord ashcroft after he predicted an election defeat.  the prime minister ratcheted up labour s pre-election campaigning at the weekend with a helicopter tour of the country and his speech at the party s spring conference. he insisted he did not know the poll date  but it is widely expected to be 5 may.  in what was seen as a highly personal speech in gateshead on sunday  mr blair said:  i have the same passion and hunger as when i first walked through the door of 10 downing street.  he described his relationship with the public as starting euphoric  then struggling to live up to the expectations  and reaching the point of raised voices and  throwing crockery . he warned his supporters against complacency  saying:  it s a fight for the future of our country  it s a fight that for britain and the people of britain we have to win.   mr blair said that whether the public chose michael howard or mr kennedy  it would result in  a tory government not a labour government and a country that goes back and does not move forward . dr fox accused mr blair and other cabinet ministers of telling lies about their opponents  policies and then attacking the lies.  what we learned at the weekend is what labour tactics are going to be and it s going to be fear and smear   he told bbc news. the tory co-chairman attacked labour s six new pledges as  vacuous  and said mr blair was very worried voters would take revenge for his failure to deliver. dr fox refused to discuss weekend newspaper reports that the party had repaid £500 000 to former tory treasurer lord ashcroft after he said the party could not win the election.  we repay loans when they are due but do not comment to individual financial matters   he said  insisting he enjoyed a  warm and constructive  relationship to lord ashcroft.  meanwhile lib dem leader charles kennedy is expected to attack mr blair s words as he begins a nationwide tour on monday. mr kennedy is accelerating lib dem election preparations this week as he visits manchester  liverpool  leicester  somerset  basingstoke  shrewsbury  dorset and torbay. he said:  this is three-party politics. in the northern cities  the contest is between labour and the liberal democrats.  in southern and rural seats - especially in the south west - the principal contenders are the liberal democrats and the conservatives  who are out of the running in scotland and wales.  the lib dems accuse mr blair of making a  touchy-feely  speech to labour delegates which will not help him regain public trust.,fox attack blair torus lie toni blair lie take uk war qualm lie elect campaign say torus torus cochairman liam fox speak mr blair told labour member torus offer hard right agenda dr fox told bbc radio will lie reason go war guess go lie anyth would discus report parti repaid £ lord ashcroft predict elect defeat prime minist ratchet labour preelect campaign weekend helicopt tour countri speech parti spring confer insist know poll date wide expect may see highli person speech gateshead sunday mr blair say passion hunger first walk door down street describ relationship public start euphor struggl live expect reach point rais voic throw crockeri warn support complac say fight futur countri fight britain peopl britain win mr blair say whether public chose michael howard mr kennedi would result torus govern labour govern countri goe back move forward dr fox accus mr blair cabinet minist tell lie oppon polici attack lie learn weekend labour tactic go go fear smear told bbc news torus cochairman attack labour six new pledg vacuou say mr blair worri voter would take reveng failur deliv dr fox refus discus weekend newspap report parti repaid £ former torus treasur lord ashcroft say parti could win elect repay loan due comment individu financi matter say insist enjoy warm construct relationship lord ashcroft meanwhil lib dem leader charl kennedi expect attack mr blair word begin nationwid tour monday mr kennedi acceler lib dem elect prepar week visit manchest liverpool leicest somerset basingstok shrewsburi dorset torbay say threeparti polit northern citi contest labour liber democrat southern rural seat especi south west princip contend liber democrat conserv run scotland wale lib dem accus mr blair make touchyfe speech labour deleg help regain public trust
3,864,online commons to spark debate online communities set up by the uk government could encourage public debate and build trust  says the institute of public policy research (ippr).  existing services such as ebay could provide a good blueprint for such services  says the think-tank. although the net is becoming part of local and central government  its potential has not yet been fully exploited to create an online  commons  for public debate. in its report  is online community a policy tool   the ippr also asks if id cards could help create safer online communities. adopting an ebay-type model would let communities create their own markets for skills and services and help foster a sense of local identity and connection.  what we are proposing is a civic commons   will davies  senior research fellow at the ippr told the bbc news website.  a single publicly funded and run online community in which citizens can have a single place to go where you can go to engage in diversity and in a way that might have a policy implication - like a pre-legislation discussion.   the idea of a  civic commons  was originally proposed by stephen coleman  professor of e-democracy at the oxford internet institute. the ippr report points to informal  small scale examples of such commons that already exist. it mentions good-practice public initiatives like the bbc s ican project which connects people locally and nationally who want to take action around important issues.  but he adds  government could play a bigger role in setting up systems of trust for online communities too. proposals for id cards  for instance  could also be widened to see if they could be used online. they could provide the basis for a secure authentication system which could have value for peer-to-peer interaction online.  at the moment they have been presented as a way for government to keep tabs on people and ensuring access to public services   said mr davies.  but what has not been explored is how authentication technology may potentially play a role in decentralised online communities.  the key idea to take from systems such as ebay and other online communities is letting members rate each other s reputation by how they treat other members. using a similar mechanism  trust and cooperation between members of virtual and physical communities could be built. this could mean a civic commons would work within a non-market system which lets people who may disagree with one another interact within publicly-recognised rules.  e-government initiatives over the last decade have very much been about putting basic information and service guides online as well as letting people interact with government via the web. many online communities  such as chatrooms  mailing lists  community portals  message boards and weblogs often form around common interests or issues.  with 53% of uk households now with access to the net  the government  suggests mr davies  could act as an intermediary or  middleman  to set up public online places of debate and exchange to encourage more  cosmopolitan politics  and public trust in policy.  government already plays a critical role in helping citizens trade with each other online.  but it should also play a role in helping citizens connect to one another in civic  non-market interactions   said mr davies. there is a role for public bodies like the bbc  libraries  and government to bring people back into public debate again instead of millions of  cliques  talking to each other  he added. the paper is part of the ippr s digital society initiative which is producing a number of conferences and research papers leading up to the publication of a manifesto for a digital britain.,onlin common spark debat onlin commun set uk govern could encourag public debat build trust say institut public polici research ippr exist servic ebay could provid good blueprint servic say thinktank although net becom part local central govern potenti yet fulli exploit creat onlin common public debat report onlin commun polici tool ippr also ask id card could help creat safer onlin commun adopt ebaytyp model would let commun creat market skill servic help foster sen local ident connect propos civic common davi senior research fellow ippr told bbc news websit singl publicli fund run onlin commun citizen singl place go go engag diver way might polici implic like prelegisl discus idea civic common origin propos stephen coleman professor edemocraci oxford internet institut ippr report point inform small scale exampl common alreadi exist mention goodpractic public initi like bbc ican project connect peopl local nation want take action around import issu add govern could play big role set system trust onlin commun propos id card instanc could also widen see could use onlin could provid basi secur authent system could valu peertop interact onlin moment present way govern keep tab peopl ensur access public servic say mr davi explor authent technolog may potenti play role decentralis onlin commun key idea take system ebay onlin commun let member rate reput treat member use similar mechan trust cooper member virtual physic commun could built could mean civic common would work within nonmarket system let peopl may disagre one anoth interact within publiclyrecognis rule egovern initi last decad much put basic inform servic guid onlin well let peopl interact govern via web mani onlin commun chatroom mail list commun portal messag board weblog often form around common interest issu uk household access net govern suggest mr davi could act intermediari middleman set public onlin place debat exchang encourag cosmopolitan polit public trust polici govern alreadi play critic role help citizen trade onlin also play role help citizen connect one anoth civic nonmarket interact say mr davi role public bodi like bbc librari govern bring peopl back public debat instead million cliqu talk ad paper part ippr digit societi initi produc number confer research paper lead public manifesto digit britain
4,2184,piero gives rugby perspective bbc sport unveils its new analysis tool piero at the wales v england rugby union match on saturday. but what does it do and how does it work   picture the scene - wales are camped on the england line in the dying seconds of the six nations  opening match. a ball is flung out to winger shane williams who crosses to score the winning try for wales. but the england players are incensed - arguing that the pass was forward and the try should not stand. in the past  sports fans would be left debating the validity of the try for days and weeks to come. but bbc sport s new tool piero could end discussions in minutes.  piero  named after the italian painter and pioneer of perspective piero della francesco  creates a virtual stadium in which virtual players can be tracked from almost any angle. viewers will be able to see precisely how the ball was thrown and by whom  giving a greater depth to the growing wealth of analysis available during sports broadcasts. the technology has been created by bbc research and development for bbc broadcast and bbc outside broadcasts. bbc sport is the first client to start using the system.  in order to keep audiences growing and growing... we need to work closely with people who create technology and innovation to bring sport to life   said andrew thompson  the bbc s head of development  new media and sports news.  we want to appeal to core fans - to give them more analysis  more detail  more definitive answers about key passages of play.  piero works by taking telemetric data from fixed camera positions and sending that data inside the video signal to a pc which can then render the information into 3d graphics.  the more cameras using piero  the better the detail possible out the other end when the data is turned into 3d models.  it allows us to tell the story of a passage of play  tracking individual players across the field  looking at tactics   said andy townsend  from bbc broadcast.  an operator can manipulate the information and provide almost real-time replays of incidents  as well as more in-depth analysis. the  virtual camera  can focus on virtually any aspect of the pitch  giving viewers an insight into action that the camera normally cannot see. piero also provides a wealth of statistical detail - from the length of kicks  to the length of a run of an individual player and the height of a lift at any lineout. mr townsend said sports performance companies were already showing an interest in the technology. bbc broadcast hopes the technology can be sold to third parties interested in using it a number of different ways - from sport broadcasting to entertainment and game shows.,piero give rugbi perspect bbc sport unveil new analysi tool piero wale v england rugbi union match saturday work pictur scene wale camp england line die second six nation open match ball flung winger shane william cross score win tri wale england player incens argu pas forward tri stand past sport fan would left debat valid tri day week come bbc sport new tool piero could end discus minut piero name italian painter pioneer perspect piero della francesco creat virtual stadium virtual player track almost angl viewer abl see precis ball thrown give great depth grow wealth analysi avail sport broadcast technolog creat bbc research develop bbc broadcast bbc outsid broadcast bbc sport first client start use system order keep audienc grow grow need work close peopl creat technolog innov bring sport life say andrew thompson bbc head develop new medium sport news want appeal core fan give analysi detail definit answer key passag play piero work take telemetr data fix camera posit send data insid video signal pc render inform d graphic camera use piero well detail possibl end data turn d model allow u tell stori passag play track individu player across field look tactic say andi townsend bbc broadcast oper manipul inform provid almost realtim replay incid well indepth analysi virtual camera focu virtual aspect pitch give viewer insight action camera normal see piero also provid wealth statist detail length kick length run individu player height lift lineout mr townsend say sport perform compani alreadi show interest technolog bbc broadcast hope technolog sell third parti interest use number differ way sport broadcast entertain game show
5,1322,us retail sales surge in december us retail sales ended the year on a high note with solid gains in december  boosted by strong car sales.  seasonally adjusted sales rose 1.2% in the month  compared to 0.1% a month earlier  boosted by a surge in shopping just before and after christmas. sales climbed 8% for the year  the best performance since an 8.5% rise in 1999  the commerce department added. the gains were led by a 4.3% jump in auto sales as dealers used enhanced offers to get cars out of showrooms. dealers were forced to cut prices in december to maintain sales growth in a tough quarter when the usual end-of-year holiday sales boom was slow to get started.  the increase in sales during december pushed total spending for the month to $349.4bn (£265.9bn). sales for the year also broke through the $4 trillion mark for the first time - with annual sales coming in at $4.06 trillion however  if automotives are excluded from december s data  retail sales rose just 0.3% on the month. home furnishings and furniture stores also performed well  rising 2.2%. but as well as hitting the shops  more us consumers were going online or using mail order for their purchases - with non-store retailers seeing sales rise by 1.9%. however  analysts said that the strong figures were unlikely to put the federal reserve bank off its current policy of measured interest rate rises.  consumers for now remain willing to spend freely  sustaining the us expansion. given that attitude  the fed remains likely to continue boosting the fed funds rate at upcoming meetings   ubs economist maury harris told reuters.  retail sales are seen as a major part of consumer spending - which in turn makes up two-thirds of economic output in the us. consumer spending has been picking up in recent years after slumping during 2001 and 2002 as the country battled to recover from its first recession of the decade and the world trade centre attacks. during that time  sales grew a lacklustre 2.9% in 2001 and 2.5% a year later. looking ahead  analysts now expect improvement in jobs growth to feed through to the high street with consumer spending remaining strong. the belief comes despite the latest labor department report showing a surprise rise in unemployment. the number of americans filing initial jobless claims jumped to 367 000  the highest rate since september. however  long-term claims slipped to their lowest level since 2001.,u retail sale surg decemb u retail sale end year high note solid gain decemb boost strong car sale season adjust sale rise month compar month earlier boost surg shop christma sale climb year best perform sinc rise commerc depart ad gain lead jump auto sale dealer use enhanc offer get car showroom dealer forc cut price decemb maintain sale growth tough quarter usual endofyear holiday sale boom slow get start increas sale decemb push total spend month bn £bn sale year also broke trillion mark first time annual sale come trillion howev automot exclud decemb data retail sale rise month home furnish furnitur store also perform well rise well hit shop u consum go onlin use mail order purchas nonstor retail see sale rise howev analyst say strong figur unlik put feder reserv bank current polici measur interest rate rise consum remain will spend freeli sustain u expans give attitud fed remain like continu boost fed fund rate upcom meet ub economist mauri harri told reuter retail sale see major part consum spend turn make twothird econom output u consum spend pick recent year slump countri battl recov first recess decad world trade centr attack time sale grow lacklustr year later look ahead analyst expect improv job growth feed high street consum spend remain strong belief come despit late labor depart report show surpris rise unemploy number american file initi jobless claim jump high rate sinc septemb howev longterm claim slip low level sinc
6,930,casual gaming to  take off  games aimed at  casual players  are set to be even bigger in 2005  according to industry experts.  easy-to-play titles that do not require too much time and that are playable online or downloadable to mobile devices will see real growth in the coming year. the trend shows that gaming is not just about big-hitting  games console titles  which appeal more to  hardcore  gamers  said a panel of experts. they were speaking before the annual consumer electronics show in las vegas which showcases the latest trends in gadgets and technologies for 2005. the panel also insisted that casual gamers were not just women  a common misconception which pervades current thinking about gamer demographics.  casual games like poker  pool  bridge  bingo and puzzle-based titles  which can be played online or downloaded onto mobile devices  were  gender neutral  and different genres attracted different players.  greg mills  program director at aol  said its figures suggested that sports-based games attracted 90% of 18 to 24-year-old males  while puzzle games were played by 80% of females. games like bridge tended to attract the over-50 demographic of gamers.  but hardcore gamers who are more attracted to blockbuster gamers which usually require hi-spec pcs  like half-life 2  or halo 2 on xbox  also liked to have a different type of gaming experience.  when hardcore gamers are not playing halo  they are playing poker and pool  based on our research   said geoff graber  director of yahoo games  which attracts about 12 million gamers a month.  with the growth of powerful pc technology and ownership  broadband take-up  portable players and mobile devices  as well as interactive tv  casual gaming is shaping up to be big business in 2005  according to the panel. the focus for the coming year should be about attracting third-party developers into the field to offer more innovative and multiplayer titles  they agreed.  we are at a time where we are on the verge of something much bigger   said mr graber.  casual games will get into their stride in 2005  will be really big in 2006 and will be about community.  with more people finding more to do with their gadgets and high-speed connections  casual games would start to open up the world of gaming as a form of mass-market entertainment to more people. key to these types of titles is the chance they give people who may not see themselves as gamers to dip in and out of games when they liked.  portal sites which offer casual games  like aol  yahoo  and realarcade  as well as other games-on-demand services  allow people to build up buddy lists so they can return and play against the same people. this aspect of  community  is crucial for gamers who just want to have quick access to free or cheap games without committing long periods of time immersed in £30 to £40 console or pc titles  said the panel. about 120 000 people are expected to attend the ces trade show which stretches over more than 1.5 million square feet and which officially runs from 6 to 9 january. the main theme is how new devices are getting better at talking to each other  allowing people to enjoy

10,1554,blair pledges unity to labour mps tony blair has sought to reassure labour backbenchers that nothing will stand in the way of the party s bid for a third term in power.  mr blair was speaking to mps amid fresh rumours of a rift with gordon brown. a new book says the prime minister went back on a pledge to mr brown to stand down before the next general election. the chancellor has said he is focused on winning the poll and is due to join election supremo alan milburn for a labour poster launch this week. mr blair told the parliamentary labour party (plp) on monday:  i know from everyone here  in cabinet and government  nothing is going to get in the way of a unified labour party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need.  the prime minister and his chancellor arrived within seconds of each other and seemingly in good spirits at the start of the meeting which lasted around an hour. a new book  brown s britain by sunday telegraph journalist robert peston  says mr blair went back on a pledge to make way for mr brown after cabinet allies intervened in june 2004.  it has caused a new wave of concern among labour mps gearing up to defend their seats in an election  widely expected to be held in may  and several members are understood to have lined up to express their discontent at the plp meeting. health secretary john reid earlier warned that labour members would not easily forgive anybody fuelling damaging speculation. he told bbc news:  those who co-operate or inspire these books  in my view  have to know that  whatever the short-term political or personal advantage that they think they might secure  they always do it by damaging the record  the unity and the re-election chances of the labour party and the government.  mr blair on sunday dismissed claims of broken promises  saying:  i ve dealt with this six months ago. i said then you don t do deals over jobs like this - you don t.   in a separate bbc interview  mr brown said he and the prime minister would not be distracted by  gossip .  it s very important that we all do what we can in a unified way to ensure the election of a labour government   he said.  on monday  mr blair s spokesman said:  the prime minister is determined that he will get on with the business of government because he believes that what people want.  mr brown says he discussed the election campaign with mr blair on saturday and promised to play his part.  mr peston said the pair had  mutual animosity and contempt . mr blair had decided in november 2003 he would quit because he felt he had lost voters  trust because of the iraq war.  he had then changed his mind in june 2004  following intervention from cabinet allies and suspicion that the chancellor was manoeuvring against him. mr brown allegedly said he could no longer believe anything mr blair told him. conservative co-chairman liam fox likened the two men to  self-obsessed schoolboys . liberal democrat parliamentary chairman matthew taylor said their personal ambition was  getting in the way of good government . ex-labour leader neil kinnock said mr blair and mr brown could only deal with the media frenzy by continuing to say they would not allow a row to damage labour or british interests. he told bbc radio five live that mr brown would never encourage any kind of insurrection or coup.,blair pledg uniti labour mp toni blair sought reassur labour backbench noth stand way parti bid third term power mr blair speak mp amid fresh rumour rift gordon brown new book say prime minist go back pledg mr brown stand next gener elect chancellor say focus win poll due join elect supremo alan milburn labour poster launch week mr blair told parliamentari labour parti plp monday know everyon cabinet govern noth go get way unifi labour parti unifi posit win third term peopl desper need prime minist chancellor arriv within second seemingli good spirit start meet last around hour new book brown britain sunday telegraph journalist robert peston say mr blair go back pledg make way mr brown cabinet alli interven june caus new wave concern among labour mp gear defend seat elect wide expect held may sever member understood line express discont plp meet health secretari john reid earlier warn labour member would easili forgiv anybodi fuell damag specul told bbc news cooper inspir book view know whatev shortterm polit person advantag think might secur alway damag record uniti reelect chanc labour parti govern mr blair sunday dismiss claim broken promis say dealt six month ago say deal job like separ bbc interview mr brown say prime minist would distract gossip import unifi way ensur elect labour govern say monday mr blair spokesman say prime minist determin get busi govern believ peopl want mr brown say discus elect campaign mr blair saturday promis play part mr peston say pair mutual animos contempt mr blair decid novemb would quit felt lose voter trust iraq war chang mind june follow intervent cabinet alli suspicion chancellor manoeuvr mr brown allegedli say could longer believ anyth mr blair told conserv cochairman liam fox liken two men selfobsess schoolboy liber democrat parliamentari chairman matthew taylor say person ambit get way good govern exlabour leader neil kinnock say mr blair mr brown could deal medium frenzi continu say would allow row damag labour british interest told bbc radio five live mr brown would never encourag kind insurrect coup

14,1587,apple ipod family expands market apple has expanded its ipod family with the release of its next generation of the digital music players.  its latest challenges to the growing digital music gadget market include an ipod mini model which can hold 6gb compared to a previous 4gb. the company  which hopes to keep its dominant place in the digital music market  also said the gold coloured version of the mini would be dropped. a 30gb version has also been added to the ipod photo family. the latest models have a longer battery life and their prices have been cut by an average of £40. the original ipod took an early lead in the digital music player market thanks to its large storage capacity and simple design.  during 2004 about 25 million portable players were sold  10 million of which were apple ipods. but analysts agree that the success is also down to its integration with the itunes online store  which has given the company a 70% share of the legal download music market. mike mcguire  a research director at analyst gartner  told the bbc news website that apple had done a good job in  sealing off the market from competition  so far.  they have created a very seamless package which i think is the idea of the product - the design  function and the software are very impressive   he said. he added that the threat from others was always present  however.  creative  other microsoft-partnered devices  real  sony and so on  are ratcheting up the marketing message and advertising   he said. creative was very upbeat about how many of its creative zen players it had shipped by the end of last year  he said. its second-generation models  like the creative zen micro photo  is due out in the summer. it will have 5gb of memory on board.  digital music players are now the gadget of choice among young americans  according to recent research by the pew internet and american life project. one in 10 us adults - 22 million people - now owns a digital music player of some sort. sales of legally downloaded songs also rose more than tenfold in 2004  according to the record industry  with 200 million tracks bought online in the us and europe in 12 months. the ifpi industry body said that the popularity of portable music players was behind the growth. analysts say that the ease of use and growth of music services available on the net will continue to drive the trend towards portable music players.  people are also starting to use them in novel ways. some are combining automatic syncing functions many of them have with other net functions to automatically distribute diy radio shows  called podcasts. but 2005 will also see more competition from mobile phone operators who are keen to offer streaming services on much more powerful and sophisticated handsets. according to mr mcguire  research suggests that people like the idea of building up huge libraries of music  which they can do with high-capacity storage devices  like ipods and creative zens. mobiles do not yet have this capacity though  and there are issues about the ease of portability of mobile music. mr mcguire said apple was ensuring it kept a foot in the mobile music door with its recent deal with motorola to produce a version of itunes for motorola phones.,appl ipod famili expand market appl expand ipod famili releas next gener digit music player late challeng grow digit music gadget market includ ipod mini model hold gb compar previou gb compani hope keep domin place digit music market also say gold colour version mini would drop gb version also ad ipod photo famili late model longer batteri life price cut averag £ origin ipod take earli lead digit music player market thank larg storag capac simpl design million portabl player sell million appl ipod analyst agre success also integr itun onlin store give compani share legal download music market mike mcguir research director analyst gartner told bbc news websit appl do good job seal market competit far creat seamless packag think idea product design function softwar impress say ad threat other alway present howev creativ microsoftpartn devic real soni ratchet market messag advertis say creativ upbeat mani creativ zen player ship end last year say secondgener model like creativ zen micro photo due summer gb memori board digit music player gadget choic among young american accord recent research pew internet american life project one u adult million peopl own digit music player sort sale legal download song also rise tenfold accord record industri million track bought onlin u europ month ifpi industri bodi say popular portabl music player behind growth analyst say ea use growth music servic avail net continu drive trend toward portabl music player peopl also start use novel way combin automat sync function mani net function automat distribut diy radio show call podcast also see competit mobil phone oper keen offer stream servic much power sophist handset accord mr mcguir research suggest peopl like idea build huge librari music highcapac storag devic like ipod creativ zen mobil yet capac though issu ea portabl mobil music mr mcguir say appl ensur kept foot mobil music door recent deal motorola produc version itun motorola phone
15,1375,eu software patent law faces axe the european parliament has thrown out a bill that would have allowed software to be patented.  politicians unanimously rejected the bill and now it must go through another round of consultation if it is to have a chance of becoming law. during consultation the software patents bill could be substantially re-drafted or even scrapped. the bill was backed by some hi-tech firms  saying they needed protections it offered to make research worthwhile.  hugo lueders  european director for public policy at comptia  an umbrella organization for technology companies  said only when intellectual property was adequately protected would european inventors prosper. he said the benefits of the bill had been obscured by special interest groups which muddied debate over the rights and wrongs of software patents. other proponents of the bill said it was a good compromise that avoided the excesses of the american system which allows the patenting of business practices as well as software. but opponents of the bill said that it could stifle innovation  be abused by firms keen to protect existing monopolies and could hamper the growth of the open source movement. the proposed law had a troubled passage through the european parliament. its progress was delayed twice when polish meps rejected plans to adopt it. also earlier this month the influential european legal affairs committee (juri) said the law should be re-drafted after it failed to win the support of meps. to become law both the european parliament and a qualified majority of eu states have to approve of the draft wording of the bill. the latest rejection means that now the bill on computer inventions must go back to the eu for re-consideration.,eu softwar patent law face axe european parliament thrown bill would allow softwar patent politician unanim reject bill must go anoth round consult chanc becom law consult softwar patent bill could substanti redraft even scrap bill back hitech firm say need protect offer make research worthwhil hugo lueder european director public polici comptia umbrella organ technolog compani say intellectu properti adequ protect would european inventor prosper say benefit bill obscur special interest group muddi debat right wrong softwar patent propon bill say good compromis avoid excess american system allow patent busi practic well softwar oppon bill say could stifl innov abus firm keen protect exist monopoli could hamper growth open sourc movement propos law troubl passag european parliament progress delay twice polish mep reject plan adopt also earlier month influenti european legal affair committe juri say law redraft fail win support mep becom law european parliament qualifi major eu state approv draft word bill late reject mean bill comput invent must go back eu reconsider

19,1813,fannie mae  should restate books  us mortgage company fannie mae should restate its earnings  a move that is likely to put a billion-dollar dent in its accounts  watchdogs have said.  the securities & exchange commission accused fannie mae of using techniques that  did not comply in material respects  with accounting standards. fannie mae last month warned that some records were incorrect. the other main us mortgage firm freddie mac restated earnings by $5bn (£2.6bn) last year after a probe of its books. the sec s comments are likely to increase pressure on congress to strengthen supervision of fannie mae and freddie mac.  the two firms are key parts of the us financial system and effectively underwrite the mortgage market  financing nearly half of all american house purchases and dealing actively in bonds and other financial instruments. the investigation of freddie mac in june 2003 sparked concerns about the wider health of the industry and raised questionsmarks over the role of the office of federal housing enterprise oversight (ofheo)  the industry s main regulator. having been pricked into action  the ofheo turned its attention to fannie may and in september this year said that the firm had tweaked its books to spread earnings more smoothly across quarters and play down the amount of risk it had taken on. the sec found similar problems. the watchdog s chief accountant donald nicolaisen said that  fannie mae s methodology of assessing  measuring and documenting hedge ineffectiveness was inadequate and was not supported  by generally accepted accounting principles.,fanni mae restat book u mortgag compani fanni mae restat earn move like put billiondollar dent account watchdog say secur exchang commiss accus fanni mae use techniqu compli materi respect account standard fanni mae last month warn record incorrect main u mortgag firm freddi mac restat earn bn £bn last year probe book sec comment like increas pressur congress strengthen supervis fanni mae freddi mac two firm key part u financi system effect underwrit mortgag market financ nearli half american hous purchas deal activ bond financi instrument investig freddi mac june spark concern wider health industri rais questionsmark role offic feder hous enterpris oversight ofheo industri main regul prick action ofheo turn attent fanni may septemb year say firm tweak book spread earn smoothli across quarter play amount risk take sec found similar problem watchdog chief account donald nicolaisen say fanni mae methodolog ass measur document hedg ineffect inadequ support gener accept account principl
20,658,freeze on anti-spam campaign a campaign by lycos europe to target spam-related websites appears to have been put on hold.  earlier this week the company released a screensaver that bombarded the sites with data to try to bump up the running costs of the websites. but the site hosting the screensaver now displays a pink graphic and the words  stay tuned . no one at lycos was available for comment on latest developments in its controversial anti-spam campaign.  lycos europe s  make love not spam  campaign was intended as a way for users to fight back against the mountain of junk mail flooding inboxes. people were encouraged to download the screensaver which  when their pc was idle  would then send lots of data to sites that peddle the goods and services mentioned in spam messages. lycos said the idea was to get the spam sites running at 95% capacity and generate big bandwidth bills for the spammers behind the sites. but the plan has proved controversial.  monitoring firm netcraft analysed response times for some of the sites targeted by the screensaver and found that a number were completely knocked offline.  the downing of the sites could dent lycos claims that what it is doing does not amount to a distributed denial of service attack. in such attacks thousands of computers bombard sites with data in an attempt to overwhelm them. laws in many countries do not explicitly outlaw such attacks but many nations are re-drafting computer use laws to make them specific offences. lycos europe now appears to have put the plan on hold. the site hosting the screensaver currently shows a holding page  with the words   stay tuned . the numerical internet address of the site has also changed. this is likely to be in response to spammers who have reportedly redirected traffic from their sites back to the lycos screensaver site. the campaign has come under fire from some corners of the web. many discussion groups have said that it set a dangerous precedent and could incite vigilantism.  attacking a spammer s website is like poking a grizzly bear sleeping in your back garden with a pointy stick   said graham cluley  senior technology consultant for sophos.  not only is this screensaver similar in its approach to a potentially illegal distributed denial of service attack  but it also is in danger of turning innocent computer users into vigilantes  who may not be prepared for whatever retaliation the spammers care to dream up.,freez antispam campaign campaign lyco europ target spamrel websit appear put hold earlier week compani releas screensav bombard site data tri bump run cost websit site host screensav display pink graphic word stay tune one lyco avail comment late develop controversi antispam campaign lyco europ make love spam campaign intend way user fight back mountain junk mail flood inbox peopl encourag download screensav pc idl would send lot data site peddl good servic mention spam messag lyco say idea get spam site run capac gener big bandwidth bill spammer behind site plan prove controversi monitor firm netcraft analys respons time site target screensav found number complet knock offlin down site could dent lyco claim amount distribut denial servic attack attack thousand comput bombard site data attempt overwhelm law mani countri explicitli outlaw attack mani nation redraft comput use law make specif offenc lyco europ appear put plan hold site host screensav current show hold page word stay tune numer internet address site also chang like respons spammer reportedli redirect traffic site back lyco screensav site campaign come fire corner web mani discus group say set danger preced could incit vigilant attack spammer websit like poke grizzli bear sleep back garden pointi stick say graham cluley senior technolog consult sopho screensav similar approach potenti illeg distribut denial servic attack also danger turn innoc comput user vigilant may prepar whatev retali spammer care dream
21,762,oscars steer clear of controversy the oscars nominations list has left out some of the most controversial films of the past year in favour of safer  less contentious cinema.  if best film nominees were drawn on the basis of column inches  two of the front-runners would have had to be michael moore s bush-baiting documentary fahrenheit 9/11 and mel gibson s the passion of the christ. both films polarised opinion but had critics talking  and the public turning up to see them - fahrenheit 9/11 breaking us box office records for a documentary  and the passion of the christ making more than us$370m (£196m) in the us alone. but this year s academy awards have shied away from the big name controversies  with the passion of the christ - a film accused of being anti-semitic - receiving nominations only in the  minor  categories of cinematography  makeup and musical score.  fahrenheit 9/11 has also been overlooked  despite winning the palme d or at the cannes international film festival in 2004.  moore s caustic documentary may have been affected by its distributors  decision to enter it in the best picture category  rather than best documentary  says tim dams  the news editor of trade magazine screen international. but he also believes the strong political viewpoint of moore s film does not sit well with the academy.  if you look at past oscar winners and nominees  the very conservative oscar voters tend to go for very conservative  epic-style pictures. fahrenheit 9/11 didn t really fit in to that category.  they tend to go for films like titanic  gladiator  and the lord of the rings  films with scale that often aren t too contentious   he said. while he said the oscar voting panel were not  snubbing  moore s film  he thought it was unlikely a documentary could ever seriously compete in a best film category.  i think it s more a misjudgement by the people putting it out rather than a deliberate snub   he said.  the problem with mel gibson s film  he believed  was that the voting panel may have been cautious in nominating a film with dialogue in aramaic  an ancient middle eastern language.   hollywood doesn t tend to like foreign-language films - no-one s ever tried doing a film in a dead language   he said. but aside from these two films  some potentially contentious pictures have won nominations. the german film the downfall  a biopic tracing the final days of nazi leader adolf hitler in his berlin bunker  has been recognised in the best foreign film category. the film has caused some controversy in showing hitler as a fallible but human man  rather than a semi-mythical  historical monster. but mr dams said:  it s not an inflammatory film. it has done very well in germany  and it s a film that portrays hitler as a human rather than some kind of devil or monster.  another  contentious  film  mr dams said  has gained a nomination in the best documentary section through the force of its charm.  independent film-maker morgan spurlock may have forced fast-food giant mcdonalds to withdraw its  super size  portions in the us after he went on a month-long diet eating nothing but mcdonalds meals - and filmed his progress.  the film has been a hit around the world. mr dams said:  it s a political film  but it s quite fun and punky and well-paced.  morgan spurlock is a really likeable guy. it s a very accessible film  and it doesn t beat you over the head with its views.  while in fahrenheit 9/11 there are moments of comedy  i think the way that super size me is put together - the fact it s a very likeable film - means it s won through on charm.  dam s pick at this year s oscars  the aviator  martin scorsese s biopic of aviation pioneer and hollywood player howard hughes. tinseltown  it seems  likes nothing more than a picture about one of its own.,oscar steer clear controversi oscar nomin list left controversi film past year favour safer less contenti cinema best film nomine drawn basi column inch two frontrunn would michael moor bushbait documentari fahrenheit mel gibson passion christ film polaris opinion critic talk public turn see fahrenheit break u box offic record documentari passion christ make usm £m u alon year academi award shi away big name controversi passion christ film accus antisemit receiv nomin minor categori cinematographi makeup music score fahrenheit also overlook despit win palm cann intern film festiv moor caustic documentari may affect distributor decis enter best pictur categori rather best documentari say tim dam news editor trade magazin screen intern also believ strong polit viewpoint moor film sit well academi look past oscar winner nomine conserv oscar voter tend go conserv epicstyl pictur fahrenheit realli fit categori tend go film like titan gladiat lord ring film scale often contenti say say oscar vote panel snub moor film thought unlik documentari could ever serious compet best film categori think misjudg peopl put rather deliber snub say problem mel gibson film believ vote panel may cautiou nomin film dialogu arama ancient middl eastern languag hollywood tend like foreignlanguag film noon ever tri film dead languag say asid two film potenti contenti pictur nomin german film downfal biopic trace final day nazi leader adolf hitler berlin bunker recognis best foreign film categori film caus controversi show hitler fallibl human man rather semimyth histor monster mr dam say inflammatori film do well germani film portray hitler human rather kind devil monster anoth contenti film mr dam say gain nomin best documentari section forc charm independ filmmak morgan spurlock may forc fastfood giant mcdonald withdraw super size portion u go monthlong diet eat noth mcdonald meal film progress film hit around world mr dam say polit film quit fun punki wellpac morgan spurlock realli likeabl guy access film beat head view fahrenheit moment comedi think way super size put togeth fact likeabl film mean charm dam pick year oscar aviat martin scorses biopic aviat pioneer hollywood player howard hugh tinseltown seem like noth pictur one
22,1989,wilkinson to miss ireland match england will have to take on ireland in the six nations without captain and goal-kicker jonny wilkinson  according to his newcastle boss rob andrew.  wilkinson - who had targeted the 27 february match for his international comeback - has been missed by england  not least for his goal-kicking.  jonny s not fit yet   falcons chief andrew told bbc radio five live.  he won t be fit for dublin  there s no doubt about that  but he might be fit for scotland and italy.  the 25-year-old has not played for england since the 2003 world cup final after a succession of injuries. england  who have lost three six nations games in a row  wasted a 17-6 half-time lead in their 18-17 defeat to france. goal-kickers charlie hodgson and olly barkley missed six penalty attempts and a drop-goal between them.  they ve probably got two of the best english kickers in the premiership in hodgson and barkley   added andrew  a former england fly-half and goal-kicker.   they re both pretty good kickers. charlie is a good kicker week-in  week-out.  but it s all about pressure and unfortunately england are just not handling the pressure at the moment.  andrew also blamed england s poor run of recent results on a lack of leadership in the side following several high-profile retirements and injuries.  they just didn t have that leadership that would have seen them through. martin johnson  lawrence dallaglio and jonny are obviously huge losses and leadership is so important in those situations   he said.  i think it is really difficult for jason robinson to lead the side effectively from full-back.  meanwhile  former england full-back dusty hare put england s mistakes down to a lack of mental toughness.   jonny wilkinson has proved himself a cool customer with around an 80% kicking success rate   hare told bbc radio five live.  but natural-born toughness comes into it as well as all the practice you do.  you have to be able to shut out all the outside elements and concentrate on putting the ball between the posts.  hodgson  who has an excellent kicking record with club side sale sharks  has introduced crowd noise into his practice routine of late.  the top golfers don t hit the fairway every time  and it is the same with goal-kicking   hare added.  you need that mental toughness as well to put the ball over  but great goal-kickers like jonny wilkinson come along very rarely.,wilkinson miss ireland match england take ireland six nation without captain goalkick jonni wilkinson accord newcastl bos rob andrew wilkinson target februari match intern comeback miss england least goalkick jonni fit yet falcon chief andrew told bbc radio five live fit dublin doubt might fit scotland itali yearold play england sinc world cup final success injuri england lose three six nation game row wast halftim lead defeat franc goalkick charli hodgson olli barkley miss six penalti attempt dropgoal probabl get two best english kicker premiership hodgson barkley ad andrew former england flyhalf goalkick pretti good kicker charli good kicker weekin weekout pressur unfortun england handl pressur moment andrew also blame england poor run recent result lack leadership side follow sever highprofil retir injuri leadership would see martin johnson lawrenc dallaglio jonni obvious huge loss leadership import situat say think realli difficult jason robinson lead side effect fullback meanwhil former england fullback dusti hare put england mistak lack mental tough jonni wilkinson prove cool custom around kick success rate hare told bbc radio five live naturalborn tough come well practic abl shut outsid element concentr put ball post hodgson excel kick record club side sale shark introduc crowd nois practic routin late top golfer hit fairway everi time goalkick hare ad need mental tough well put ball great goalkick like jonni wilkinson come along rare

25,155,google s toolbar sparks concern search engine firm google has released a trial tool which is concerning some net users because it directs people to pre-selected commercial websites.  the autolink feature comes with google s latest toolbar and provides links in a webpage to amazon.com if it finds a book s isbn number on the site. it also links to google s map service  if there is an address  or to car firm carfax  if there is a licence plate. google said the feature  available only in the us   adds useful links . but some users are concerned that google s dominant position in the search engine market place could mean it would be giving a competitive edge to firms like amazon.  autolink works by creating a link to a website based on information contained in a webpage - even if there is no link specified and whether or not the publisher of the page has given permission.  if a user clicks the autolink feature in the google toolbar then a webpage with a book s unique isbn number would link directly to amazon s website. it could mean online libraries that list isbn book numbers find they are directing users to amazon.com whether they like it or not. websites which have paid for advertising on their pages may also be directing people to rival services. dan gillmor  founder of grassroots media  which supports citizen-based media  said the tool was a  bad idea  and an unfortunate move by a company that is looking to continue its hypergrowth . in a statement google said the feature was still only in beta  ie trial  stage and that the company welcomed feedback from users. it said:  the user can choose never to click on the autolink button  and web pages she views will never be modified.  in addition  the user can choose to disable the autolink feature entirely at any time.   the new tool has been compared to the smart tags feature from microsoft by some users. it was widely criticised by net users and later dropped by microsoft after concerns over trademark use were raised. smart tags allowed microsoft to link any word on a web page to another site chosen by the company. google said none of the companies which received autolinks had paid for the service. some users said autolink would only be fair if websites had to sign up to allow the feature to work on their pages or if they received revenue for any  click through  to a commercial site. cory doctorow  european outreach coordinator for digital civil liberties group electronic fronter foundation  said that google should not be penalised for its market dominance.  of course google should be allowed to direct people to whatever proxies it chooses.  but as an end user i would want to know -  can i choose to use this service    how much is google being paid     can i substitute my own companies for the ones chosen by google  .  mr doctorow said the only objection would be if users were forced into using autolink or  tricked into using the service .,googl toolbar spark concern search engin firm googl releas trial tool concern net user direct peopl preselect commerci websit autolink featur come googl late toolbar provid link webpag amazoncom find book isbn number site also link googl map servic address car firm carfax licenc plate googl say featur avail u add use link user concern googl domin posit search engin market place could mean would give competit edg firm like amazon autolink work creat link websit base inform contain webpag even link specifi whether publish page give permiss user click autolink featur googl toolbar webpag book uniqu isbn number would link directli amazon websit could mean onlin librari list isbn book number find direct user amazoncom whether like websit paid advertis page may also direct peopl rival servic dan gillmor founder grassroot medium support citizenbas medium say tool bad idea unfortun move compani look continu hypergrowth statement googl say featur still beta ie trial stage compani welcom feedback user say user choos never click autolink button web page view never modifi addit user choos disabl autolink featur entir time new tool compar smart tag featur microsoft user wide criticis net user later drop microsoft concern trademark use rais smart tag allow microsoft link word web page anoth site chosen compani googl say none compani receiv autolink paid servic user say autolink would fair websit sign allow featur work page receiv revenu click commerci site cori doctorow european outreach coordin digit civil liberti group electron fronter foundat say googl penalis market domin cours googl allow direct peopl whatev proxi choos end user would want know choos use servic much googl paid substitut compani one chosen googl mr doctorow say object would user forc use autolink trick use servic

30,210,aragones angered by racism fine spain coach luis aragones is furious after being fined by the spanish football federation for his comments about thierry henry.  the 66-year-old criticised his 3000 euros (£2 060) punishment even though it was far below the maximum penalty.  i am not guilty  nor do i accept being judged for actions against the image of the sport   he said.  i m not a racist and i ve never lacked sporting decorum. i ve never done that and i have medals for sporting merit.  aragones was handed the fine on tuesday after making racist remarks about henry to arsenal team-mate and spanish international jose reyes last october.  the spanish football federation at first declined to take action against aragones  but was then requested to do so by spain s anti-violence commission. the fine was far less than the expected amount of about £22 000 or even the suspension of his coaching licence. arsenal boss arsene wenger  who was fined £15 000 in december for accusing manchester united striker ruud van nistelrooy of cheating  believes that aragones  punishment was too lenient.  you compare his fine and my fine  and if you consider his was for racist abuse  then you seem to get away with it more in spain than you should   wenger said.  he shouldn t have said what he said  and how much money is enough  i don t know but it doesn t look a big punishment.  however  aragones insists the fine is unjustified and unfair.  i have been treated like islero (the bull that killed famous bullfighter manolete)   said aragones on hearing he had been fined for his actions.  i have not liked one thing about this whole affair and i do not agree with the sanction. they have looked for a scapegoat.  spain s anti-violence commission must now ratify the spanish fa s decision and has until next week to announce its verdict. aragones has 10 days to appeal  and the commission can also appeal. alberto flores  president of the spanish fa s disciplinary committee  said no-one in the committee felt aragones was a racist nor had  acted in a racist way.   a fine  the highest we could apply  is sufficient punishment. suspension would have been a bit exaggerated   flores told sports daily marca.,aragon anger racism fine spain coach lui aragon furiou fine spanish footbal feder comment thierri henri yearold criticis euro £ punish even though far maximum penalti guilti accept judg action imag sport say racist never lack sport decorum never do medal sport merit aragon hand fine tuesday make racist remark henri arsen teammat spanish intern jose rey last octob spanish footbal feder first declin take action aragon request spain antiviol commiss fine far less expect amount £ even suspens coach licenc arsen bos arsen wenger fine £ decemb accus manchest unit striker ruud van nistelrooy cheat believ aragon punish lenient compar fine fine consid racist abus seem get away spain wenger say say say much money enough know look big punish howev aragon insist fine unjustifi unfair treat like islero bull kill famou bullfight manolet say aragon hear fine action like one thing whole affair agre sanction look scapegoat spain antiviol commiss must ratifi spanish fa decis next week announc verdict aragon day appeal commiss also appeal alberto flore presid spanish fa disciplinari committe say noon committe felt aragon racist act racist way fine high could appli suffici punish suspens would bit exagger flore told sport daili marca
31,1283,uk firm faces venezuelan land row venezuelan authorities have said they will seize land owned by a british company as part of president chavez s agrarian reform programme.  officials in cojedes state said on friday that farmland owned by a subsidiary of the vestey group would be taken and used to settle poor farmers. the government is cracking down on so-called latifundios  or large rural estates  which it says are lying idle. the vestey group said it had not been informed of any planned seizure.  the firm  whose agroflora subsidiary operates 13 farms in venezuela  insisted that it had complied fully with venezuelan law. prosecutors in the south of the country have targeted hato el charcote  a beef cattle ranch owned by agroflora. according to reuters  they plan to seize 12 900 acres (5 200 hectares) from the 32 000 acre (13 000 hectare) farm.  officials claim that agroflora does not possess valid documents proving its ownership of the land in question. they also allege that areas of the ranch are not being used for any form of active production.  the legal boundaries did not match up with the actual boundaries and there is surplus   state prosecutor alexis ortiz told reuters.  as a consequence the government has taken action.   controversial reforms passed in 2001 give the government the right to take control of private property if it is declared idle or ownership cannot be traced back to the 19th century.  critics say the powers - which president chavez argues are needed to help the country s poorest citizens and develop the venezuelan economy - trample all over private property rights. the vestey group said it had owned the land since 1920 and would co-operate fully with the authorities. but a spokesman added:  agroflora is absolutely confident that what it has submitted will demonstrate the legality of its title to the land.  the company pointed out that the farm  which employs 300 workers  provides meat solely for the venezuelan market.  last month  the government said it had identified more than 500 idle farms and had yet to consider the status of a further 40 000. the authorities said landowners whose titles were in order and whose farms were productive had  nothing to fear . under president chavez  the venezuelan government has steadily expanded the state s involvement in the country s economy. it recently said all mining contracts involving foreign firms would be examined to ensure they provided sufficient economic benefits to the state.,uk firm face venezuelan land row venezuelan author say seiz land own british compani part presid chavez agrarian reform programm offici cojed state say friday farmland own subsidiari vestey group would take use settl poor farmer govern crack socal latifundio larg rural estat say lie idl vestey group say inform plan seizur firm whose agroflora subsidiari oper farm venezuela insist compli fulli venezuelan law prosecutor south countri target hato el charcot beef cattl ranch own agroflora accord reuter plan seiz acr hectar acr hectar farm offici claim agroflora posse valid document prove ownership land question also alleg area ranch use form activ product legal boundari match actual boundari surplu state prosecutor alexi ortiz told reuter consequ govern take action controversi reform pas give govern right take control privat properti declar idl ownership trace back th centuri critic say power presid chavez argu need help countri poorest citizen develop venezuelan economi trampl privat properti right vestey group say own land sinc would cooper fulli author spokesman ad agroflora absolut confid submit demonstr legal titl land compani point farm employ worker provid meat sole venezuelan market last month govern say identifi idl farm yet consid statu author say landown whose titl order whose farm product noth fear presid chavez venezuelan govern steadili expand state involv countri economi recent say mine contract involv foreign firm would examin ensur provid suffici econom benefit state
32,1650,us trade gap ballooned in october the us trade deficit widened by more than expected in october  hitting record levels after higher oil prices raised import costs  figures have shown  the trade shortfall was $55.5bn (£29bn)  up 9% from september  the commerce department said. that pushed the 10 month deficit to $500.5bn. imports rose by 3.4%  while exports increased by only 0.6%. a weaker dollar also increased the cost of imports  though this should help drive export demand in coming months.  things are getting worse  but that s to be expected   said david wyss of standard & poor s in new york.  the first thing is that when the dollar goes down  it increases the price of imports.  we are seeing improved export orders. things seem to be going in the right direction.   despite this optimism  significant concerns remain as to how the us will fund its trade and budget deficits should they continue to widen. another problem highlighted by analysts was the growing trade gap with china  which has been accused of keeping its currency artificially weak in order to boost exports. the us imported almost $20bn worth of goods from china during october  exporting a little under $3bn.  it seems the key worry that has existed in the currency market still remains   said anthony crescenzi  a bond strategist at miller tabak in new york. the trade deficit and the shortfall with china  are big issues going forward . the commerce department figures caused the dollar to weaken further despite widespread expectations that the federal reserve will raise interest rates for a fifth time this year. borrowing costs are tipped to rise by a quarter of a percentage point to 2.25% at a fed meeting later on tuesday.,u trade gap balloon octob u trade deficit widen expect octob hit record level high oil price rais import cost figur show trade shortfal bn £bn septemb commerc depart say push month deficit bn import rise export increas weaker dollar also increas cost import though help drive export demand come month thing get wors expect say david wy standard poor new york first thing dollar goe increas price import see improv export order thing seem go right direct despit optim signific concern remain u fund trade budget deficit continu widen anoth problem highlight analyst grow trade gap china accus keep currenc artifici weak order boost export u import almost bn worth good china octob export littl bn seem key worri exist currenc market still remain say anthoni crescenzi bond strategist miller tabak new york trade deficit shortfal china big issu go forward commerc depart figur caus dollar weaken despit widespread expect feder reserv rais interest rate fifth time year borrow cost tip rise quarter percentag point fed meet later tuesday
33,1102,talks aim to avert pension strike talks aimed at averting a series of national strikes over pensions reforms will take place this weekend.  five public sector unions will hold private talks with deputy prime minister john prescott at labour s spring conference in gateshead. they want the government to withdraw regulations - due to be introduced in weeks - which would raise the pension age for council workers from 60 to 65. up to 1.4m workers could take part in a strike already earmarked for 23 march. however  all sides are anxious to avoid a major confrontation in the run up to the general election  said bbc labour affairs correspondent stephen cape. in four days  britain s biggest union unison will start balloting 800 000 local government workers on strikes. other public sector unions have pledged to follow. it is just weeks before new regulations are introduced to raise the pension age of local government workers.  the five unions meeting mr prescott want the government to withdraw these regulations. this would allow months of tough negotiations to follow  said our correspondent. but a spokesman for mr prescott warned that the changes to the local government pension scheme would have to go ahead in april. privately ministers believe this will be the  less painful  option  our correspondent added. the public and commercial services union (pcs) will co-ordinate any industrial action with up to six other public sector unions. pcs leader mark serwotka warned last week that there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink.  for a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service  choice on this and choice on that - isn t it ironic that they re saying to public sector workers there is no choice   he said.  if you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years - that is working until people drop.  in the 20th century  it s completely unacceptable.   unison s 800 000 workers  the transport and general workers  union s 70 000 and amicus  20 000 are among those being balloted about a 23 march walkout. mr prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures last week. it is understood no deal was offered in that meeting but there was room for further negotiations.,talk aim avert pension strike talk aim avert seri nation strike pension reform take place weekend five public sector union hold privat talk deputi prime minist john prescott labour spring confer gateshead want govern withdraw regul due introduc week would rais pension age council worker m worker could take part strike alreadi earmark march howev side anxiou avoid major confront run gener elect say bbc labour affair correspond stephen cape four day britain big union unison start ballot local govern worker strike public sector union pledg follow week new regul introduc rais pension age local govern worker five union meet mr prescott want govern withdraw regul would allow month tough negoti follow say correspond spokesman mr prescott warn chang local govern pension scheme would go ahead april privat minist believ less pain option correspond ad public commerci servic union pc coordin industri action six public sector union pc leader mark serwotka warn last week could walkout unless govern rethink govern lectur everyon choic choic public servic choic choic iron say public sector worker choic say want pension promis start must work extra five year work peopl drop th centuri complet unaccept unison worker transport gener worker union amicu among ballot march walkout mr prescott held privat meet senior union figur last week understood deal offer meet room negoti

35,973,seamen sail into biometric future the luxury cruise liner crystal harmony  currently in the gulf of mexico  is the unlikely setting for tests of biometric technology.  as holidaymakers enjoy balmy breezes  their ship s crew is testing prototype versions of the world s first internationally issued biometric id cards  the seafarer s equivalent of a passport. along with the owner s picture  name and personal details  the new seafarers  identity document incorporates a barcode representing unique features of its holder s fingerprints. the cards are due to be issued in february next year  in line with the revised un convention on seafarers  identity documents of june 2003. tests currently under way in the caribbean are designed to ensure that new cards and their machine readers  produced by different companies in different countries  are working to interoperable standards. results of the current tests  which involve seafarers from a wide range of occupations and nationalities  will be published by the international labour organisation (ilo) by the end of november. crystal cruises  which operates the crystal harmony  is exploring the use of biometrics but has not yet committed to the technology.  authenti-corp  the us technology consultancy  has been working with the ilo on its technical specifications for the cards.   if you re issued a seafarer s id in your country  you want to be sure that when the ship lands in a port in  say  my country you can validate yourself using whatever equipment we have installed   authenti-corp s ceo  cynthia musselman  told the bbc s go digital programme. she said french  jordanian and nigerian nationals would be the first seafarers to get the new id cards since their countries have already ratified the convention. it aims to combat international terrorism whilst guaranteeing the welfare the one million seafarers estimated to be at sea. the convention highlights the importance of access to shore facilities and shore leave as vital elements to a sailor s wellbeing and  therefore  it says  to safer shipping and cleaner oceans.  by increasing security on the seas as well as border control and protection  the cards will hopefully reduce the number of piracy problems around the world   said ms musselman.  it should be a safer environment for seafarers to work in  and will allow people protecting their borders to have confidence that the people getting off the ship are  in fact  seafarers.,seaman sail biometr futur luxuri cruis liner crystal harmoni current gulf mexico unlik set test biometr technolog holidaymak enjoy balmi breez ship crew test prototyp version world first intern issu biometr id card seafar equival passport along owner pictur name person detail new seafar ident document incorpor barcod repres uniqu featur holder fingerprint card due issu februari next year line revis un convent seafar ident document june test current way caribbean design ensur new card machin reader produc differ compani differ countri work interoper standard result current test involv seafar wide rang occup nation publish intern labour organis ilo end novemb crystal cruis oper crystal harmoni explor use biometr yet commit technolog authenticorp u technolog consult work ilo technic specif card issu seafar id countri want sure ship land port say countri valid use whatev equip instal authenticorp ceo cynthia musselman told bbc go digit programm say french jordanian nigerian nation would first seafar get new id card sinc countri alreadi ratifi convent aim combat intern terror whilst guarante welfar one million seafar estim sea convent highlight import access shore facil shore leav vital element sailor wellb therefor say safer ship cleaner ocean increas secur sea well border control protect card hope reduc number piraci problem around world say m musselman safer environ seafar work allow peopl protect border confid peopl get ship fact seafar

39,1969,brussels raps mobile call charges the european commission has written to the mobile phone operators vodafone and t-mobile to challenge  the high rates  they charge for international roaming.  in letters sent to the two companies  the commission alleged the firms were abusing their dominant market position in the german mobile phone market. it is the second time vodafone has come under the commission s scrutiny. the uk operator is already appealing against allegations that its uk roaming rates are  unfair and excessive . vodafone s response to the commission s letter was defiant.  we believe the roaming market is competitive and we expect to resist the charges   said a vodafone spokesman.  however we will need time to examine the statement of objections in detail before we formally respond.   the commission s investigation into vodafone and deutsche telekom s t-mobile centres on the tariffs the two companies charge foreign mobile operators to access their networks when subscribers of those foreign operators use their mobile phones in germany.  the commission believes these wholesale prices are too high and that the excess is passed on to consumers.  the commission aims to ensure that european consumers are not overcharged when they use their mobile phones on their travels around the european union   the commission said in a statement. vodafone and o2  britain s other big mobile phone operator  were sent similar statements of objections by the commission in july last year. vodafone sent the commission a response to those allegations in december last year and is now waiting for a reply. the vodafone spokesman said a similar process would be set in motion with these latest statement of objections about its operations in germany.  the companies will have three months to respond to the commission s allegations and the process  may go on for some time yet   the spokesman said. the commission could charge the companies up to 10% of their annual turnover  though in practice that sort of figure is rarely demanded. the commission s latest move comes just a few months after national telecoms regulators across europe launched a joint investigation which could lead to people being charged less for using their mobile phone when travelling abroad. the investigation involves regulators assessing whether there is effective competition in the roaming market.,brussel rap mobil call charg european commiss write mobil phone oper vodafon tmobil challeng high rate charg intern roam letter sent two compani commiss alleg firm abus domin market posit german mobil phone market second time vodafon come commiss scrutini uk oper alreadi appeal alleg uk roam rate unfair excess vodafon respons commiss letter defiant believ roam market competit expect resist charg say vodafon spokesman howev need time examin statement object detail formal respond commiss investig vodafon deutsch telekom tmobil centr tariff two compani charg foreign mobil oper access network subscrib foreign oper use mobil phone germani commiss believ wholesal price high excess pas consum commiss aim ensur european consum overcharg use mobil phone travel around european union commiss say statement vodafon o britain big mobil phone oper sent similar statement object commiss juli last year vodafon sent commiss respons alleg decemb last year wait repli vodafon spokesman say similar process would set motion late statement object oper germani compani three month respond commiss alleg process may go time yet spokesman say commiss could charg compani annual turnov though practic sort figur rare demand commiss late move come month nation telecom regul across europ launch joint investig could lead peopl charg less use mobil phone travel abroad investig involv regul ass whether effect competit roam market

41,627,businesses fail to plan for hiv companies fail to draw up plans to cope with hiv/aids until it affects 20% of people in a country  new research says.  the finding comes in a report published on thursday by the world economic forum  harvard and the un aids agency.  too few companies are responding proactively to the social and business threats   said dr kate taylor  head of the wef s global health initiative. nearly 9 000 business leaders in 104 countries were surveyed for business and hiv/aids: commitment and action   dr taylor described the level of action taken by businesses as revealed by the report as  too little  too late . the issue will be highlighted to business and world leaders at the world economic forum  which meets in davos  switzerland  next week. the wef report shows that despite the fact that 14 000 people contract hiv/aids every day  concern among businesses has dropped by 23% in the last 12 months. most (71%) have no policies in place to address the disease. nor could over 65% of the business leaders surveyed say or estimate the prevalence of hiv among their staff. the un programme tackling aids  unaids  pointed out that having a clear strategy for dealing with hiv/aids was a good investment as well as being socially responsible.  one company that does have a plan is anglo-american  the international mining company  which estimates an hiv prevalence of 24% among its 130 000-strong southern african workforce.  over the last two years the company has implemented extensive voluntary counselling and testing for hiv infection  coupled with anti-retroviral therapy for employees progressing to aids. over 90% of the 2 200 employees who have accessed and remained on treatment are well and have returned to normal work.  effective action on hiv/aids is synonymous with good business management and leads to more profitable and sustainable operations   said brian brink  senior vice-president  health  at anglo-american.   companies should encourage all workers to know their hiv status  making it as routine as monitoring blood pressure or cholesterol   he said.  providing access to treatment is a critical part of this.  across sub-saharan africa  even in countries with an hiv prevalence of 10-19%  only around 7% of companies have formal hiv/aids policies in place  according to the report. the gap is even wider in china  ethiopia  india  nigeria and russia  the so-called  next wave  countries  which are predicted to experience the highest numbers of new hiv/aids cases worldwide by 2010. the report adds  an important building block to our understanding of how the business community is experiencing the hiv/aids epidemic and to whether and how it is reacting   said david bloom  professor of economics and demography at the harvard school of public health.  the wef report concludes that businesses need to understand their exposure to hiv/aids risks and come up with good local practices to manage them. a key priority  in both high and low-prevalence settings  said the wef is to establish a policy based on non-discrimination and confidentiality.,busi fail plan hiv compani fail draw plan cope hivaid affect peopl countri new research say find come report publish thursday world econom forum harvard un aid agenc compani respond proactiv social busi threat say dr kate taylor head wef global health initi nearli busi leader countri survey busi hivaid commit action dr taylor describ level action take busi reveal report littl late issu highlight busi world leader world econom forum meet davo switzerland next week wef report show despit fact peopl contract hivaid everi day concern among busi drop last month polici place address diseas could busi leader survey say estim preval hiv among staff un programm tackl aid unaid point clear strategi deal hivaid good invest well social respons one compani plan angloamerican intern mine compani estim hiv preval among strong southern african workforc last two year compani implement extens voluntari counsel test hiv infect coupl antiretrovir therapi employe progress aid employe access remain treatment well return normal work effect action hivaid synonym good busi manag lead profit sustain oper say brian brink senior vicepresid health angloamerican compani encourag worker know hiv statu make routin monitor blood pressur cholesterol say provid access treatment critic part across subsaharan africa even countri hiv preval around compani formal hivaid polici place accord report gap even wider china ethiopia india nigeria russia socal next wave countri predict experi high number new hivaid case worldwid report add import build block understand busi commun experienc hivaid epidem whether react say david bloom professor econom demographi harvard school public health wef report conclud busi need understand exposur hivaid risk come good local practic manag key prioriti high lowpreval set say wef establish polici base nondiscrimin confidenti
42,947,tories outlining policing plans local communities would be asked to go to the polls to elect their own area police commissioner  under plans unveiled by the conservatives.  party leader michael howard said the new role would replace  inconspicuous  police authorities. he said the new office would not supersede the job of a chief constable. the lib dems said the plan could let extreme groups run policing  while labour criticised  extravagant  tory promises on policing.  responding to the plans  the chairman of the police federation of england and wales  which represents rank and file officers  said it was essential operational independence was retained.  jan berry said:  it is a service  not a political football to be kicked around every time an election approaches.  these plans could result in those with extreme political views dictating what actually happens on the ground   she warned. outlining his crime manifesto  mr howard said elected police commissioners would be more accountable than police authorities which are made up of local councillors and magistrates.  the commissioner will have the powers which existing police authorities have   he told bbc radio 4 s today programme.  the trouble is  and it s no reflection on the people who are on the police authority - they are good people - but hardly anyone knows who they are.  mr howard said the authorities were not  providing the local accountability that we want to see  and that elected police commissioners would be more visible.  critics fear the move could hand control of the police to single-issue campaigners who would ignore the needs of the wider community. lord harris  who sits on the executive of association of police authorities  said the plans seemed to suggest chief constables should be told what to do by a single politician.  that is overturning nearly 200 years of the way in which we have organised policing in this country to avoid the politicisation of policing decisions   he said.  liberal democrat home affairs spokesman mark oaten said the plan was dangerous and  could create conflict between chief constables and elected officials . mr oaten said local people had too little control over policing but a far better solution would be for elected councillors to draw up a  minimum policing guarantee  with their chief constables. a labour party spokesman criticised michael howard s record  saying police numbers had fallen by 1 132 when he was home secretary. he said:  today the tories are making more extravagant promises on the police without making clear how they would pay for them  other than through fantasy savings to the asylum system.  the tories insists the commissioner role would not be like that of an american sheriff. other tory law and order plans include building more prisons and making criminals serve full jail sentences.,torus outlin polic plan local commun would ask go poll elect area polic commission plan unveil conserv parti leader michael howard say new role would replac inconspicu polic author say new offic would supersed job chief constabl lib dem say plan could let extrem group run polic labour criticis extravag torus promis polic respond plan chairman polic feder england wale repres rank file offic say essenti oper independ retain jan berri say servic polit footbal kick around everi time elect approach plan could result extrem polit view dictat actual happen ground warn outlin crime manifesto mr howard say elect polic commission would account polic author make local councillor magistr commission power exist polic author told bbc radio today programm troubl reflect peopl polic author good peopl hardli anyon know mr howard say author provid local account want see elect polic commission would visibl critic fear move could hand control polic singleissu campaign would ignor need wider commun lord harri sit execut associ polic author say plan seem suggest chief constabl told singl politician overturn nearli year way organis polic countri avoid politicis polic decis say liber democrat home affair spokesman mark oaten say plan danger could creat conflict chief constabl elect offici mr oaten say local peopl littl control polic far well solut would elect councillor draw minimum polic guarante chief constabl labour parti spokesman criticis michael howard record say polic number fall home secretari say today torus make extravag promis polic without make clear would pay fantasi save asylum system torus insist commission role would like american sheriff torus law order plan includ build prison make crimin serv full jail sentenc
43,1537,further rise in uk jobless total the uk s jobless total rose for the second month in a row in december  official figures show.  the number of people out of work rose 32 000 to 1.41 million in the last three months of 2004  even as 90 000 more people were in employment. average earnings rose by 4.3% in the year to december up from november s 4.2%  the office for national statistics (ons) added. meanwhile  the benefit claimant total fell 11 000 to 813 200 last month. throughout 2004  the number of people in work increased by 296 000 to 28.52 million - the highest figure since records began in 1971.  the apparent discrepancy between rising unemployment and record numbers in work can be explained by an increase in the working population and a fall in those who are economically inactive. while the uk s jobless rate rose to 4.7% from 4.6% in the previous quarter  the rate still remains one of the lowest in the world  compared with 12.1% in germany  10.4% in spain and 9.7% in france. but  despite more people being in work  the manufacturing sector continued to suffer  with 104 000 workers axed during the last quarter of 2004 - pushing employment in the sector to a record low of 3.24 million by the end of last year. the figures prompted some analysts to forecast that the bank of england will almost certainly raise rates this year. marc ostwald  a strategist at monument securities told reuters that while no immediate market impact could be expected   it is enough to underline that they (the boe) will be more hawkish on rates .,rise uk jobless total uk jobless total rise second month row decemb offici figur show number peopl work rise million last three month even peopl employ averag earn rise year decemb novemb offic nation statist on ad meanwhil benefit claimant total fell last month throughout number peopl work increas million high figur sinc record begin appar discrep rise unemploy record number work explain increas work popul fall econom inact uk jobless rate rise previou quarter rate still remain one low world compar germani spain franc despit peopl work manufactur sector continu suffer worker axe last quarter push employ sector record low million end last year figur prompt analyst forecast bank england almost certainli rais rate year marc ostwald strategist monument secur told reuter immedi market impact could expect enough underlin boe hawkish rate
44,482,thomas out of six nations wales captain gareth thomas has been ruled out of the rest of the six nations with a broken thumb.  the full-back will have surgery on monday after fracturing his thumb in the 24-18 win over france on saturday. but welsh legend phil bennett insisted wales can cope without thomas as they chase a first grand slam in 27 years. bennett told bbc sport:  such is the spirit in the camp  they ll put kevin morgan at 15  rhys williams at wing and just carry on.  thomas will miss the match against scotland on 13 march  and what promises to be a huge encounter against the irish six days later. bennett added:  it s a setback. he s a great captain  he leads from the front and the boys love him.  thomas was replaced at half-time by williams as his side turned around a 15-6 deficit in paris.   with gareth missing i would think michael owen will be our captain   said wales coach mike ruddock.  he did a great job in the second half in france. he has been vice-captain all along throughout the championship.  wales travel to edinburgh to take on scotland in a fortnight and then host ireland in cardiff in the final round of matches in what could be the grand slam and championship decider. bennett  an inspirational fly-half for llanelli and wales in the 1970s  insisted the national team were entering a new golden period.  it was a great game and a magnificent result for wales   bennett told bbc radio five live s sportsweek programme.   the way this young team are blending  the glory days are on their way back.  we couldn t get possession early on and france dominated and scored two tries.  had they been ruthless  wales could have gone into the interval 30 points down. but they didn t take their chances.  wales defended fairly well but you cannot give that sort of quality ball to good sides.  the all blacks would have been ruthless and buried us in the first half. but the character we showed in the second half was quite outstanding.,thoma six nation wale captain gareth thoma rule rest six nation broken thumb fullback surgeri monday fractur thumb win franc saturday welsh legend phil bennett insist wale cope without thoma chase first grand slam year bennett told bbc sport spirit camp put kevin morgan rhi william wing carri thoma miss match scotland march promis huge encount irish six day later bennett ad setback great captain lead front boy love thoma replac halftim william side turn around deficit pari gareth miss would think michael owen captain say wale coach mike ruddock great job second half franc vicecaptain along throughout championship wale travel edinburgh take scotland fortnight host ireland cardiff final round match could grand slam championship decid bennett inspir flyhalf llanelli wale s insist nation team enter new golden period great game magnific result wale bennett told bbc radio five live sportsweek programm way young team blend glori day way back get posse earli franc domin score two tri ruthless wale could go interv point take chanc wale defend fairli well give sort qualiti ball good side black would ruthless buri u first half charact show second half quit outstand
45,1574,karachi stocks hit historic high the karachi stock exchange (kse) has recorded its largest single day gain  surging 3.5% to a new high.  the index rose 225.79 points in four hours of furious trading  with many investors optimistic that political stability could bring an economic boom. the kse index closed at 6709.93 - an overall gain of nearly 400 points in the first two trading days of the week. energy and telecommunication stocks performed particularly well  recording an 8%-10% rise since monday morning.  in 2002  the kse was the world s best performing stock market  with the index rising 112%.  pakistani investors are expecting the kse to repeat  if not improve on  its 2002 performance. jubilant investors danced on the streets as the market closed for the day on tuesday  confident that the boom will continue at least until the public holiday on 22 january. others  however  who had stayed out fearing an imminent collapse because of prices overheating  continued to warn that the  bubble may burst any time .  that s rubbish   kse chairman yaseen lakhani told the bbc news website.  whenever the market reflects pakistan s true economic reality  it is described as a bubble.  mr lakhani feels that the market has risen on the basis of solid economic growth and its current level rests on sound foundations.  market analysts are inclined to agree with mr lakhani  arguing that there are a number of major factors behind the kse s performance. analysts argue that a steady improvement in pakistan s credit ratings by international credit rating agencies has finally begun to register in the market. standard & poor s upgraded pakistan a few weeks ago. there are indications of yet another upgrade by the end of february.  then  say analysts  there is corporate profitability in the current fiscal year  which has gone up by 27% from last year.  coupled with the 7% gdp growth expected by june this year  i am least surprised at the market s performance   says mr lakhani. one leading karachi broker said the real reasons may be political.  if you file a $1.3 trillion case against saudi money after 9/11  arab money will not go to the us any more.  a lot of arab money  he says  has already gone to malaysia and indonesia. pakistanis are now hoping that energy and telecoms  two of the strongest sectors in pakistan  draw some of the arab money to the kse.  locally  too  say analysts  recent political developments have worked to the market s advantage.  an anti-musharraf campaign threatened by the mma  a countrywide alliance of religious parties  has fizzled out. the release of asif zardari  former prime minister benazir bhutto s husband  has eased political tensions between the military-backed government and the opposition pakistan people s party. most importantly  say analysts  the failure of talks between india and pakistan on the baglihar dam in indian-administered kashmir has not automatically led to heightened tensions. this  they say  indicates that neither country is interested in raising the temperature at this stage  irrespective of the state of their disagreements. the market is abuzz with speculation that substantial investment may now start to flow in from the us  a country seen locally as deeply interested in defusing tensions between the south asian neighbours.  you can call it a peace dividend   smiles one

46,413,blair labour s longest-serving pm tony blair has become the labour party s longest-serving prime minister.  the 51-year-old premier has marked his 2 838th day in the post  overtaking the combined length of harold wilson s two terms during the 1960s and 1970s. if mr blair wins the next election and fulfils his promise to serve a full third term  he will surpass margaret thatcher s 11 years by the end of 2008. in 1997  mr blair became the youngest premier of the 20th century  when he came to power at the age of 43. the last prime minister to be installed at a younger age was lord liverpool  who was a year his junior in 1812.  mr blair s other political firsts include becoming the first labour leader to win two successive full terms in power after the 2001 labour landslide. and the birth of the blairs  fourth child  leo  on 20 may  2000  was the first child born to a serving prime minister in more than 150 years. the last  downing street dad  was lord john russell in 1848. labour won a huge majority of 167 over the conservatives in 2001  but mr blair has since been criticised by many in his own party. the war in iraq and reforms of the health service and education system have provoked dissent from backbenchers.  gordon brown  chancellor of the exchequer under mr blair  became britain s longest-serving chancellor of modern times in 2004. former labour leader lord kinnock said the chancellor would be best placed to take over from mr blair. when asked about the future leadership of the party  he told itv wales  waterfront programme:  that contest is a long way away and it will occur only when the prime minister  tony blair  decides he s subscribed all he can and then wants to go.  i think that the main contender will be gordon brown  who is a man of virtually unmatched capability and now great experience.  both mr brown and mr blair rose to prominence when lord kinnock led labour between 1983 and 1992.,blair labour longestserv pm toni blair becom labour parti longestserv prime minist yearold premier mark th day post overtak combin length harold wilson two term s s mr blair win next elect fulfil promis serv full third term surpass margaret thatcher year end mr blair becam young premier th centuri come power age last prime minist instal young age lord liverpool year junior mr blair polit first includ becom first labour leader win two success full term power labour landslid birth blair fourth child leo may first child born serv prime minist year last down street dad lord john russel labour huge major conserv mr blair sinc criticis mani parti war iraq reform health servic educ system provok dissent backbench gordon brown chancellor exchequ mr blair becam britain longestserv chancellor modern time former labour leader lord kinnock say chancellor would best place take mr blair ask futur leadership parti told itv wale waterfront programm contest long way away occur prime minist toni blair decid subscrib want go think main contend gordon brown man virtual unmatch capabl great experi mr brown mr blair rise promin lord kinnock lead labour
47,1091,smart search lets art fans browse if you don t know art but know what you like  new search technology could prove a useful gateway to painting.  artgarden  developed by bt s research unit  is being tested by the tate as a new way of browsing its online collection of paintings. rather than search by the name of an artist or painting  users are shown a selection of pictures. clicking on their favourite will change the gallery in front of them to a selection of similar works.  the technology uses a system dubbed smart serendipity  which is a combination of artificial intelligence and random selection. it  chooses  a selection of pictures  by scoring paintings based on a selection of keywords associated with them. so  for instance a whistler painting of a bridge may have the obvious keywords such as bridge and whistler associated to it but will also widen the search net with terms such as aesthetic movement  19th century and water. a variety of paintings will then be shown to the user  based partly on the keywords and partly on luck.  it is much more akin to wandering through the gallery   said jemima rellie  head of the tate s digital programme. for richard tateson  who worked on the artgarden project  the need for a new way to search grew out of personal frustration.  i went to an online clothes store to find something to buy my wife for christmas but i didn t have a clue what i wanted   he said. the text-based search was restricted to looking either by type of garment or designer  neither of which he found helpful. he ended up doing his present shopping on the high street instead.  he thinks the dominance of text-based searching is not necessarily appealing to the majority of online shoppers. similarly  with art  browsing is often more important than finding a particular object.  you don t arrive at tate britain and tell people what you want to see. one of the skills of showing off the collection is to introduce people to things they wouldn t have asked for   he said. the tate is committed to making its art more accessible and technology such as artgarden can help with that  said ms rellie. she hopes the technology can be incorporated on to the website in the near future. bt research is looking at extending the technology to other searching  such as for music and films.,smart search let art fan brow know art know like new search technolog could prove use gateway paint artgarden develop bt research unit test tate new way brow onlin collect paint rather search name artist paint user show select pictur click favourit chang galleri front select similar work technolog use system dub smart serendip combin artifici intellig random select choos select pictur score paint base select keyword associ instanc whistler paint bridg may obviou keyword bridg whistler associ also widen search net term aesthet movement th centuri water varieti paint show user base partli keyword partli luck much akin wander galleri say jemima relli head tate digit programm richard tateson work artgarden project need new way search grow person frustrat go onlin cloth store find someth buy wife christma clue want say textbas search restrict look either type garment design neither found help end present shop high street instead think domin textbas search necessarili appeal major onlin shopper similarli art brow often import find particular object arriv tate britain tell peopl want see one skill show collect introduc peopl thing ask say tate commit make art access technolog artgarden help say m relli hope technolog incorpor websit near futur bt research look extend technolog search music film
48,1818,baron kinnock makes lords debut former labour leader neil kinnock has officially been made a life peer during a ceremony in the house of lords.  he will be known baron kinnock of bedwellty - after his former constituency. lord kinnock - who led labour from 1983 until 1992 - was until recently one of britain s eu commissioners. a former critic of the house of lords  he has said he will use the upper house to advocate its reform and to talk on issues like higher education.  i accepted the kind invitation to enter the house of lords as a working peer for practical political reasons   he said when his peerage was first announced.  it is a good base for campaigning on national issues like education  sustainable transport  industrial change and the ageing society and global concerns  particularly poverty and oppression.  during his induction into the upper house  lord kinnock was accompanied by lords leader baroness amos and baroness royall of blaisdon  a former aide to the ex-labour leader. it has been a long journey for the new lord kinnock from his earliest days as a rebellious youngster in the south wales valleys. born in 1942 in tredegar to a miner father and nurse mother  he attended lewis boys  school in nearby pengam  known then as the  eton of the valleys . from there he went to cardiff university  where he met his future wife glenys  now a labour mep.  after a brief career as a tutor for the workers  educational association  he became an mp at the age of just 28 for his home seat of bedwellty (later islwyn). he gained a reputation as a left-wing firebrand  voting against his own labour government s spending cuts proposals in 1975  and later rejecting a junior post in james callaghan s administration. but he joined the shadow cabinet in 1980  and after labour s heavy defeat in the 1983 he was elected leader. he took on the far-left militant tendency and began the long process of returning his party to the centre ground. he was not expected to win the 1987 election  when margaret thatcher was still riding high  but was bitterly disappointed to lose the next one in 1992 to john major  and stepped down. he remained an mp until 1995  when he resigned to become european commission for transport. four years later he became vice-president of the european commission  with responsibility for internal reform. as he assumes the title of lord kinnock  he has also become chairman of the british council  which promotes the uk s reputation for arts  science and education.,baron kinnock make lord debut former labour leader neil kinnock offici make life peer ceremoni hous lord know baron kinnock bedwellti former constitu lord kinnock lead labour recent one britain eu commission former critic hous lord say use upper hous advoc reform talk issu like high educ accept kind invit enter hous lord work peer practic polit reason say peerag first announc good base campaign nation issu like educ sustain transport industri chang age societi global concern particularli poverti oppress induct upper hous lord kinnock accompani lord leader baro amo baro royal blaisdon former aid exlabour leader long journey new lord kinnock early day rebelli youngster south wale valley born tredegar miner father nurs mother attend lewi boy school nearbi pengam know eton valley go cardiff univers met futur wife gleni labour mep brief career tutor worker educ associ becam mp age home seat bedwellti later islwyn gain reput leftw firebrand vote labour govern spend cut propos later reject junior post jame callaghan administr join shadow cabinet labour heavi defeat elect leader take farleft milit tendenc begin long process return parti centr ground expect win elect margaret thatcher still ride high bitterli disappoint lose next one john major step remain mp resign becom european commiss transport four year later becam vicepresid european commiss respons intern reform assum titl lord kinnock also becom chairman british council promot uk reput art scienc educ
49,1117,stormy year for property insurers a string of storms  typhoons and earthquakes has made 2004 the most expensive year on record for property insurers  according to swiss re.  the world s second biggest insurer said disasters around the globe have seen property claims reach $42bn (£21.5bn).  2004 reinforces the trend towards higher losses   said swiss re. tightly packed populations in the areas involved in natural and man-made disasters were to partly to blame for the rise in claims  it said. some 95% of insurance claims were for natural catastrophes  with the rest attributed to made-made events.  the largest claims came from the us  which was struck by four hurricanes  and japan  which suffered the highest concentration of typhoons for decades plus a major earthquake.  europe suffered fewer natural disasters  but 191 people were killed and more than 2 000 injured in march after the terrorist attack on train stations in madrid. the damages claimed in 2004 eclipsed previous years  including 2001 when the 11 september attacks pushed claims up to $37bn. swiss re said it had registered about 300 natural and man-made disasters around the world in 2004. twenty-one thousand people lost their lives in the catastrophes with a cost to the global economy of around $105bn (£54bn).,stormi year properti insur string storm typhoon earthquak make expens year record properti insur accord swiss world second big insur say disast around globe see properti claim reach bn £bn reinforc trend toward high loss say swiss tightli pack popul area involv natur manmad disast partli blame rise claim say insur claim natur catastroph rest attribut mademad event large claim come u struck four hurrican japan suffer high concentr typhoon decad plu major earthquak europ suffer few natur disast peopl kill injur march terrorist attack train station madrid damag claim eclips previou year includ septemb attack push claim bn swiss say regist natur manmad disast around world twentyon thousand peopl lose live catastroph cost global economi around bn £bn

51,1499,man city 0-2 man utd manchester united reduced chelsea s premiership lead to nine points after a scrappy victory over manchester city.  wayne rooney met gary neville s cross to the near post with a low shot  which went in via a deflection off richard dunne  to put united ahead. seven minutes later  the unfortunate dunne hooked a volley over david james  head and into his own net. steve mcmanaman wasted city s best chance when he shot wide from three yards in the first half. in the opening 45 minutes united had looked unlikely to earn the win they needed to maintain any chance of catching chelsea in the title race. their approach play was more laboured than patient and they managed to fashion just one chance - a paul scholes header over the bar. and city seemed to be content to sit back and try and hit their rivals on the break as the game settled into a tepid pattern. only shaun wright-phillips appeared capable of interrupting the monotony  looking lively down the right and causing gabriel heinze problems.  wes brown also found wright-phillips to be a difficult opponent when the tricky winger embarrassed him near the touchline. wright-phillips  sublime skill and pace took him past brown and he delivered a pin-point centre to the feet of mcmanaman. but the former liverpool player demonstrated why he has never scored against united by side-footing the easy chance wide. john o shea was forced off after an earlier clash with sylvain distin and cristiano ronaldo came on to replace him. he immediately caused ben thatcher some discomfort and looked set to inject some much-needed pace into the united attack. rooney was being well marshalled by dunne - but that was all about to change. after the break  united poured forward and there was a renewed urgency about their play. and when neville delivered a cross in a carbon copy of city s best first-half chance  rooney showed mcmanaman how to do it - even if he needed the help of dunne s leg. worse was to come for dunne  who had been having a fine match. on 75 minutes  he scored a horrible own goal when attempting to volley clear rooney s cross and united seemed home and dry. however  city did fight back and fowler missed another great chance from close range. and united keeper roy carroll saved well from kiki musampa. but united could have a had a third late on when substitute ryan giggs hit the post.  - manchester city boss kevin keegan:  we had a great chance to take the lead and the first goal was always going to be crucial.  we started off with a good tempo but then we allowed them to dictate the pace a bit too much.  but we still had four good chances  two after we d gone 2-0 down  the one mcmanaman missed was very similar to the one wayne rooney scored from.    - manchester united boss sir alex ferguson:  it wasn t our best performance of the last three months but i think we re deserved winners.  at times  especially in the first half  we didn t play with enough speed. but with (cristiano) ronaldo and (ryan) giggs on  the speed improved.  derby games can be like that  they can be scrappy  dull  horrible and it was maybe like that.  man city: james  mills (bradley wright-phillips 83)  dunne  distin  thatcher  shaun wright-phillips  barton (macken 68)  sibierski  mcmanaman  musampa  fowler. subs not used: weaver  onuoha  flood. booked: fowler  sibierski. man utd: carroll  gary neville  ferdinand  brown  heinze  o shea (ronaldo 33)  keane  fortune  fletcher (giggs 64)  rooney  scholes (phil neville 84). subs not used: howard  bellion. booked: rooney  scholes  keane. goals: rooney 68  dunne 75 og. att: 47 111 ref: s bennett (kent).,man citi man utd manchest unit reduc chelsea premiership lead nine point scrappi victori manchest citi wayn rooney met gari nevil cross near post low shot go via deflect richard dunn put unit ahead seven minut later unfortun dunn hook volley david jame head net steve mcmanaman wast citi best chanc shot wide three yard first half open minut unit look unlik earn win need maintain chanc catch chelsea titl race approach play labour patient manag fashion one chanc paul schole header bar citi seem content sit back tri hit rival break game settl tepid pattern shaun wrightphillip appear capabl interrupt monotoni look live right caus gabriel heinz problem we brown also found wrightphillip difficult oppon tricki winger embarrass near touchlin wrightphillip sublim skill pace take past brown deliv pinpoint centr foot mcmanaman former liverpool player demonstr never score unit sidefoot easi chanc wide john shea forc earlier clash sylvain distin cristiano ronaldo come replac immedi caus ben thatcher discomfort look set inject muchneed pace unit attack rooney well marshal dunn chang break unit pour forward renew urgenc play nevil deliv cross carbon copi citi best firsthalf chanc rooney show mcmanaman even need help dunn leg wors come dunn fine match minut score horribl goal attempt volley clear rooney cross unit seem home dri howev citi fight back fowler miss anoth great chanc close rang unit keeper roy carrol save well kiki musampa unit could third late substitut ryan gigg hit post manchest citi bos kevin keegan great chanc take lead first goal alway go crucial start good tempo allow dictat pace bit much still four good chanc two go one mcmanaman miss similar one wayn rooney score manchest unit bos sir alex ferguson best perform last three month think deserv winner time especi first half play enough speed cristiano ronaldo ryan gigg speed improv derbi game like scrappi dull horribl mayb like man citi jame mill bradley wrightphillip dunn distin thatcher shaun wrightphillip barton macken sibierski mcmanaman musampa fowler sub use weaver onuoha flood book fowler sibierski man utd carrol gari nevil ferdinand brown heinz shea ronaldo kean fortun fletcher gigg rooney schole phil nevil sub use howard bellion book rooney schole kean goal rooney dunn og att ref bennett kent

54,2081,howard unveils tory asylum plans tory plans to cut immigration to the uk are not racist and will make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees  michael howard has said.  as his party set out detailed asylum reform plans  mr howard said they would help smash people smuggling gangs. there would be an annual limit on asylum and all claims would be processed overseas. some charities say the plans would put refugees  lives at risk if they were turned away once quotas were filled.  tony blair said labour would set out workable plans for tackling immigration abuse in the next few weeks and attacked the tory plans.  by cutting the number of front-line immigration staff at our borders  they will actually make the problem worse   said mr blair. liberal democrat chairman matthew taylor said there needed to be a quick  fair and firm asylum system. but he said it was  absolutely disgusting  to propose a system which could turn away genuine refugees. the conservatives say there is little risk of this happening as demand for asylum will be considered when quotas are set.  in a speech in london on monday  mr howard said:  it s not racist  as some people to claim  to talk about controlling immigration far from it.  he said that coming from an immigrant family himself he recognised that  firm but fair  immigration controls were essential for good community relations.    - withdrawing from the 1951 united nations convention on refugees  which obliges countries to accept people being persecuted on the basis of need  not numbers   - introduce laws to allow the immediate removal of asylum seekers whose claims were clearly unfounded because they came from safe countries or had destroyed documents   - detain asylum seekers without documents so people whose identity was not known were not able to move freely around the uk - a worry for  national security    - stop considering asylum applications inside the uk and instead take people from united nations refugee agency camps. anyone applying for asylum would be taken to new centres close to their countries of origin.     the tories also want quotas for those seeking work permits through an australian-style points system and those wanting to join families in the uk.  mr howard said nearly 160 000 people were settling in the uk every year - the size of a city like peterborough. the plans would help achieve a  substantial reduction  in immigration  he said  although he could not predict a figure. he said that only two out of 10 asylum seekers had their claims accepted under the current  unfair and inhumane  system.   we need to break the link between arriving in britain and claiming asylum   mr howard said.  by breaking that link we can smash the criminal gangs at the heart of the trade in people smuggling.   but the un refugees agency is worried the policy sends the wrong message to poorer countries which receive the bulk of refugees. and a spokesman for european justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini said the plans would contravene eu asylum policy  which meant the uk could not simply refuse to hear an asylum case. refugee council chief executive maeve sherlock called the plans  dangerous  ill thought-out and hugely irresponsible . lives could be put at risk if refugees were turned away once the quotas were filled  she warned. commission for racial equality chairman trevor phillips said asylum applications were down 40% and economic migration down about 10%.  he did not think mr howard intended to centre the debate about race. but he warned that some campaigners could use his words to hint the policy was about keeping out people of a different colour or culture. mr howard called that suggestion  disgraceful .,howard unveil torus asylum plan torus plan cut immigr uk racist make asylum system fairer genuin refuge michael howard say parti set detail asylum reform plan mr howard say would help smash peopl smuggl gang would annual limit asylum claim would process oversea chariti say plan would put refuge live risk turn away quota fill toni blair say labour would set workabl plan tackl immigr abus next week attack torus plan cut number frontlin immigr staff border actual make problem wors say mr blair liber democrat chairman matthew taylor say need quick fair firm asylum system say absolut disgust propos system could turn away genuin refuge conserv say littl risk happen demand asylum consid quota set speech london monday mr howard say racist peopl claim talk control immigr far say come immigr famili recognis firm fair immigr control essenti good commun relat withdraw unit nation convent refuge oblig countri accept peopl persecut basi need number introduc law allow immedi remov asylum seeker whose claim clearli unfound come safe countri destroy document detain asylum seeker without document peopl whose ident know abl move freeli around uk worri nation secur stop consid asylum applic insid uk instead take peopl unit nation refuge agenc camp anyon appli asylum would take new centr close countri origin torus also want quota seek work permit australianstyl point system want join famili uk mr howard say nearli peopl settl uk everi year size citi like peterborough plan would help achiev substanti reduct immigr say although could predict figur say two asylum seeker claim accept current unfair inhuman system need break link arriv britain claim asylum mr howard say break link smash crimin gang heart trade peopl smuggl un refuge agenc worri polici send wrong messag poorer countri receiv bulk refuge spokesman european justic home affair commission franco frattini say plan would contraven eu asylum polici meant uk could simpli refus hear asylum case refuge council chief execut maev sherlock call plan danger ill thoughtout huge irrespons live could put risk refuge turn away quota fill warn commiss racial equal chairman trevor phillip say asylum applic econom migrat think mr howard intend centr debat race warn campaign could use word hint polici keep peopl differ colour cultur mr howard call suggest disgrac
55,264,ten-year tragedy of missing manic richey edwards  guitarist and lyricist for the manic street preachers  vanished 10 years ago  on 1 february 1995. his disappearance remains one of the most tragic mysteries in rock music.  for his devoted fans  richey edwards was an inspired and inspiring poet  a man who articulated their desperation and despair  who shouted the things most kept hidden. the manic street preachers may only have become stadium-conquering rock giants since his disappearance - but edwards was the figurehead for their first  dangerous and dazzling incarnation. edwards did not feature in the original line-up of the band  though. singer/guitarist james dean bradfield  bassist nicky wire and drummer sean moore were originally accompanied by a rhythm guitarist called flicker. but edwards replaced flicker in time for the band s self-financed debut  suicide alley  after designing the record s artwork.  after becoming a full-time member  edwards became a critical part of the band  writing lyrics and playing guitar - though in many concerts  he was not actually plugged in. but the fiercely intelligent edwards - who name-checked writers such as sylvia plath  george orwell and philip larkin - battled depression  alcohol problems  eating disorders  and self-harm. by the time the band released their third album  the holy bible  in october 1994  edwards had been admitted to hospital with depression. but in his last interview a few months later  seemed to be making plans for the future.  edwards walks out of the embassy hotel in london in the early morning  ahead of the band s us tour to promote the holy bible. in the following days  police issue a missing person alert and his parents  graham and sherry  plead for their son to let them know he is safe and well.  police discover edwards  car in a car park near the severn bridge near bristol -

57,1104,poll idols  face first hurdles vote for me - itv1 s pop idol style talent contest for would-be politicians - finally hits our screens this week.  over the next four days  hundreds of potential candidates will be whittled down by a panel of experts and public vote. the winner will then be encouraged to stand as an independent at the next general election  which is expected in the spring. but opinion is divided on whether any of the potential candidates unearthed so far have got what it takes to make it in politics.  any of them would make competent mps   former independent mp martin bell insisted on bbc radio 4 s today programme.  mr bell  who will be offering his advice to the contestants on wednesday  argues that westminster has its share of  odd balls  and the show will engage ordinary voters.  if it gets more people voting and more people interested in politics there is no harm in that   he said. but sir bernard ingham  margaret thatcher s former press secretary  took a less charitable view  accusing the programme of  corrupting politics .  he said the producers would not achieve their aim of re-engaging voters  with that bunch of nutters . to give sir bernard his dues  monday evening s opening episode did attract more than a smattering of eccentrics and self-publicists. among those chancing their arm were a druid priest and a former porn star  who insisted on removing her top to make her point about the legalisation of brothels. among the more eccentric policy proposals was a public holiday on bruce forsyth s birthday and bill oddie for prime minister. the show follows the time-honoured pop idol format  with queues of nervous hopefuls and a panel of three experts judging their performance.  the contestants were given 60 seconds to present their manifestos. then the final 25 were tested on their lobbying ability. they were then cross-examined by the panel  which was chaired by ex-itn political editor john sergeant  with television host lorraine kelly taking the nicki chapman role. but the real star of the show is kelvin mackenzie  in the simon cowell  mr nasty seat.  the former sun editor dispensed a stream of well-crafted insults and one-liners. his advice for one young contestant was to  get a haircut and a brain transplant . wheelchair user kevin donnellon was asked:  why on earth do you want our elected representatives to be disabled    don t you care about the inuit    implored guitar-toting environmental campaigner barry lim.  i don t care about them. i care about myself and when the sun s shining i think - fantastic   replied mr mackenzie.  mr lim later reduced the panel to fits of giggles as he outlined his plan to make people do community service instead of paying taxes.  when the prime minister turns to the chancellor and says how much have we got in the coffers mr brown  he says well  prime minister  bad news  all the houses in britain have been painted but actually nobody has paid any tax   observed mr mackenzie.  that was an total disaster. i just couldn t seem to think of things to say   a crestfallen mr lim confided in the show s presenter  jonathan maitland. irfan hanif  a 25-year-old doctor from bolton  made a good impression  even if he was a little thrown by mr mackenzie s suggestion that instead of being treated by the nhs  young drunks should  given a good beating  and left to die. dominic carman - son of late libel lawyer george carman - was voted through to the final 25  on a platform of cutting defence spending to boost education. opinion was more divided over rodney hylton-potts  a 59-year-old convicted fraudster. mr mackenzie thought the smooth-talking former solicitor - with a hardline on crime and immigration - deserved a chance to progress.  he could join the rest of the crooks in the houses of parliament.  but ms kelly said she  would not trust him as far as she could throw him . the series continues throughout the week  with the public given the chance to evict one prospective mp every night. itv will not fund the election campaign for the eventual winner  but the publicity could give the winner a flying start over other candidates.,poll idol face first hurdl vote itv pop idol style talent contest wouldb politician final hit screen week next four day hundr potenti candid whittl panel expert public vote winner encourag stand independ next gener elect expect spring opinion divid whether potenti candid unearth far get take make polit would make compet mp former independ mp martin bell insist bbc radio today programm mr bell offer advic contest wednesday argu westminst share odd ball show engag ordinari voter get peopl vote peopl interest polit harm say sir bernard ingham margaret thatcher former press secretari take less charit view accus programm corrupt polit say produc would achiev aim reengag voter bunch nutter give sir bernard due monday even open episod attract smatter eccentr selfpublicist among chanc arm druid priest former porn star insist remov top make point legalis brothel among eccentr polici propos public holiday bruce forsyth birthday bill oddi prime minist show follow timehonour pop idol format queue nervou hope panel three expert judg perform contest give second present manifesto final test lobbi abil crossexamin panel chair exitn polit editor john sergeant televis host lorrain kelli take nicki chapman role real star show kelvin mackenzi simon cowel mr nasti seat former sun editor dispens stream wellcraft insult onelin advic one young contest get haircut brain transplant wheelchair user kevin donnellon ask earth want elect repres disabl care inuit implor guitartot environment campaign barri lim care care sun shine think fantast repli mr mackenzi mr lim later reduc panel fit giggl outlin plan make peopl commun servic instead pay tax prime minist turn chancellor say much get coffer mr brown say well prime minist bad news hous britain paint actual nobodi paid tax observ mr mackenzi total disast seem think thing say crestfallen mr lim confid show present jonathan maitland irfan hanif yearold doctor bolton make good impress even littl thrown mr mackenzi suggest instead treat nh young drunk give good beat left die domin carman son late libel lawyer georg carman vote final platform cut defenc spend boost educ opinion divid rodney hyltonpott yearold convict fraudster mr mackenzi thought smoothtalk former solicitor hardlin crime immigr deserv chanc progress could join rest crook hous parliament m kelli say would trust far could throw seri continu throughout week public give chanc evict one prospect mp everi night itv fund elect campaign eventu winner public could give winner fli start candid

67,1454,broadband set to revolutionise tv bt is starting its push into television with plans to offer tv over broadband.  as a telecoms company  bt is moving to a content distribution strategy  andrew burke  chief of bt s new entertainment unit told the iptv world forum.  we want to be an entertainment facilitator   he said on the opening day of the london conference. the bbc is also trialling a service to play programmes over the net and has not ruled out offering it to non-licence fee payers overseas. the corporation s interactive media player (imp) is its first foray into broadband tv - known as iptv (internet protocol tv).   we see several opportunities for delivering the type of content that normally broadcasters find it difficult to get to viewers   said bt s andrew burke.  with more people on broadband  and connection speeds increasing  telcos around the world are looking for new ways to make money from it. increased competition between net service providers  encouraged by ofcom  has eroded bt s position in the market. it is looking for a good return on its investment in the technology which has made broadband over adsl a reality. it also sees delivering tv over broadband as a way of getting high-definition (hd) content to people sooner than they will be able to get it through conventional  regular broadcasts. the bbc s imp has just finished successful technical trials and is set for much larger consumer trials later in 2005. before it officially launches  the bbc must show the government how it offers value for money. delivering programmes over broadband offers clear public value  says the bbc  because it gives people more control  and more choice.  iptv is a similar idea to voip services  like skype. both use broadband net connections to carry information  like video and voice  in packets of data instead of conventional means. since it uses internet technology  iptv could mean more choice of programmes  more  more interactivity  tailored programming  and more localised content outside of conventional satellite  digital cable  and terrestrial broadcasts.  it is all part of the larger changing tv technology landscape and  like personal digital video recorders (pvrs)  gives people much more control over tv. broadcasters see iptv and pvrs as both as a threat and an opportunity. the bbc recognises that tv over broadband is a reality and aims to innovate with it  said rahul chakkara  controller of bbci s 24/7 interactive tv services. the imp is based on peer-to-peer technology  and lets people download programmes the bbc owns the rights to for up to seven days after broadcast.  iptv enables us to take back that programme to our audience at different times   said mr chakkara.   so we can tell our audience that that programme they paid for [via the licence fee]  they can access it any time they want.  it helps  said mr burke  that people are more au fait with terms like  digital    interactive   now that digital tv reaches more than 56% of uk homes. according to benoit joly from broadband telecoms firm thales  30% of europe cannot get satellite tv or digital tv. they could get iptv though. analysts say that iptv will account for 10% of the digital tv market in europe alone by the end of the decade. what needs to happen now  agree analysts  is for connection speeds to be bumped up to handle the service; 20mbps connections would be ideal. bt does not see itself as a broadcaster of iptv services  rather as an  enabler   said mr burke. its strategy is a  hybrid  approach  he explained  where over-the-air conventional broadcasts are supplemented with content over broadband.  initially appealing to niche markets  like sports fans  it will widen out. but iptv could be used for home-monitoring   pet cams   localised news services  and local authority tv  too says bt. it even suggests that it could target those households in the uk that do not own a computer  40% of the country.  broadband to them would not be about data and the net - that could come later for them - but about cheap phone calls and more choice of tv programmes. home choice already offers 10 000 hours of shows and channels  delivered over broadband to homes in london. with a broadband net subscription  you can also get your tv and phone service. through content deals and partnerships  it offers satellite as well as terrestrial channels  and bespoke channels based on what viewers pick and choose from its catalogues. it aims to expand nationally  but is seeing a lot of success with what it offers its 15 000 subscribers now  and aims to double uptake as well as reach by the summer. although still at a very early stage  iptv is another application for broadband that underlines its growing prominence as a backbone network - another utility like electricity.,broadband set revolutionis tv bt start push televis plan offer tv broadband telecom compani bt move content distribut strategi andrew burk chief bt new entertain unit told iptv world forum want entertain facilit say open day london confer bbc also triall servic play programm net rule offer nonlic fee payer oversea corpor interact medium player imp first foray broadband tv know iptv internet protocol tv see sever opportun deliv type content normal broadcast find difficult get viewer say bt andrew burk peopl broadband connect speed increas telco around world look new way make money increas competit net servic provid encourag ofcom erod bt posit market look good return invest technolog make broadband adsl realiti also see deliv tv broadband way get highdefinit hd content peopl sooner abl get convent regular broadcast bbc imp finish success technic trial set much large consum trial later offici launch bbc must show govern offer valu money deliv programm broadband offer clear public valu say bbc give peopl control choic iptv similar idea voip servic like skype use broadband net connect carri inform like video voic packet data instead convent mean sinc use internet technolog iptv could mean choic programm interact tailor program localis content outsid convent satellit digit cabl terrestri broadcast part large chang tv technolog landscap like person digit video record pvr give peopl much control tv broadcast see iptv pvr threat opportun bbc recognis tv broadband realiti aim innov say rahul chakkara control bbci interact tv servic imp base peertop technolog let peopl download programm bbc own right seven day broadcast iptv enabl u take back programm audienc differ time say mr chakkara tell audienc programm paid via licenc fee access time want help say mr burk peopl au fait term like digit interact digit tv reach uk home accord benoit joli broadband telecom firm thale europ get satellit tv digit tv could get iptv though analyst say iptv account digit tv market europ alon end decad need happen agre analyst connect speed bump handl servic mbp connect would ideal bt see broadcast iptv servic rather enabl say mr burk strategi hybrid approach explain overtheair convent broadcast supplement content broadband initi appeal nich market like sport fan widen iptv could use homemonitor pet cam localis news servic local author tv say bt even suggest could target household uk comput countri broadband would data net could come later cheap phone call choic tv programm home choic alreadi offer hour show channel deliv broadband home london broadband net subscript also get tv phone servic content deal partnership offer satellit well terrestri channel bespok channel base viewer pick choos catalogu aim expand nation see lot success offer subscrib aim doubl uptak well reach summer although still earli stage iptv anoth applic broadband underlin grow promin backbon network anoth util like electr
68,1155,chancellor rallies labour voters gordon brown has issued a rallying cry to supporters  warning the  stakes are too high  to stay at home or protest vote in the next general election.  the chancellor said the poll - expected to fall on 5 may - would give a  clear and fundamental  choice between labour investment and tory cuts. he told his party s spring conference the tories must not be allowed to win. the conservatives and lib dems insisted that voters faced higher taxes and means-testing under labour.  to a packed audience at gateshead s sage centre  mr brown accused shadow chancellor oliver letwin of plotting cuts that were the equivalent of sacking every teacher  gp and nurse in the country. laying into the conservative s record in government he said:  i give you this promise - with labour  britain will never return to the mistakes of erm and 10% inflation  15% interest rates  £3bn in lost reserves  250 000 repossessed  one million in negative equity and three million unemployed.  never again tory boom and bust.   this will be the central dividing line at the election  between a conservative party taking britain back and planning deep cuts of £35bn in our services  and a labour government taking britain forward  which on a platform of stability will reform and renew our hospitals  schools and public services and  i am proud to say  spend by 2008 £60bn more.  turning to the economy  the chancellor promised to continue economic stability and growth in a third term in power.  he also pledged to continue the fight against child and pensioner poverty. and he promised help to get young people on the property ladder.  my message to the thousands of young couples waiting to obtain their first home is that housing is rightly now at the centre of our coming manifesto   he said.  and the next labour government will match our low mortgage rates with a new first-time buyers  initiative.  in the speech  which prompted a standing ovation  he also promised to end teenage unemployment within the next five years.  he also highlighted plans for 100% debt relief for the world s poorest countries  a national minimum wage for 16 and 17-year-olds  the creation of a network of children s centres and flexibility in maternity leave. responding to the speech  shadow chief secretary to the treasury  george osborne  said:  this was more talk from gordon brown.  we ve heard it all before. instead of talking about the future he kept on talking about the past.  he completely failed to say which taxes he would put up to fill the black hole in his spending plans.  there will be a simple choice at the election - value for money and lower taxes with the conservatives  or more waste and higher taxes under tony blair and gordon brown.   liberal democrat shadow chancellor vince cable warned the picture was not as rosy as mr brown would like to portray it.  for all his trumpeting of labour s management of the economy  gordon brown s record is very mixed   he said.  gordon brown has created a system of massive centralisation and bureaucracy  a system which subjects millions of people to means testing  and a system of taxation which is extremely complex.  for all his positive words  gordon brown is faced with economic problems looming on the horizon  not least the unprecedented levels of personal debt facing the nation.  also in gateshead  the prime minister took questions sent in by e-mail  text message and telephone as part of labour s attempt to engage the public in their campaign. mr blair told the audience he believed the iraq war would have made britain a safer place if its emerging democracy succeeded and that he wanted to bring troops home as soon as possible  but not before the job was done. he also said he wanted to carry on as pm  because i still think that there are big changes our country needs .,chancellor ralli labour voter gordon brown issu ralli cri support warn stake high stay home protest vote next gener elect chancellor say poll expect fall may would give clear fundament choic labour invest torus cut told parti spring confer torus must allow win conserv lib dem insist voter face high tax meanstest labour pack audienc gateshead sage centr mr brown accus shadow chancellor oliv letwin plot cut equival sack everi teacher gp nurs countri lay conserv record govern say give promis labour britain never return mistak erm inflat interest rate £bn lose reserv repossess one million neg equiti three million unemploy never torus boom bust central divid line elect conserv parti take britain back plan deep cut £bn servic labour govern take britain forward platform stabil reform renew hospit school public servic proud say spend £bn turn economi chancellor promis continu econom stabil growth third term power also pledg continu fight child pension poverti promis help get young peopl properti ladder messag thousand young coupl wait obtain first home hous rightli centr come manifesto say next labour govern match low mortgag rate new firsttim buyer initi speech prompt stand ovat also promis end teenag unemploy within next five year also highlight plan debt relief world poorest countri nation minimum wage yearold creation network child centr flexibl matern leav respond speech shadow chief secretari treasuri georg osborn say talk gordon brown heard instead talk futur kept talk past complet fail say tax would put fill black hole spend plan simpl choic elect valu money low tax conserv wast high tax toni blair gordon brown liber democrat shadow chancellor vinc cabl warn pictur rosi mr brown would like portray trumpet labour manag economi gordon brown record mix say gordon brown creat system massiv centralis bureaucraci system subject million peopl mean test system taxat extrem complex posit word gordon brown face econom problem loom horizon least unpreced level person debt face nation also gateshead prime minist take question sent email text messag telephon part labour attempt engag public campaign mr blair told audienc believ iraq war would make britain safer place emerg democraci succeed want bring troop home soon possibl job do also say want carri pm still think big chang countri need
69,1041,cabinet anger at brown cash raid ministers are unhappy about plans to use whitehall cash to keep council tax bills down  local government minister nick raynsford has acknowledged.  gordon brown reallocated £512m from central to local government budgets in his pre-budget report on thursday. mr raynsford said he had held some  pretty frank discussions  with fellow ministers over the plans. but he said local governments had to deliver good services without big council tax rises.  the central government cash is part of a £1bn package to help local authorities in england keep next year s council tax rises below 5%  in what is likely to be a general election year.  mr raynsford said nearly all central government departments had an interest in well run local authorities. and he confirmed rows over the issue with ministerial colleagues.  obviously we had some pretty frank discussions about this   he told bbc radio 4 s the world at one. but he said there was a recognition that  a good settlement for local government  was important to health  education and  other government departments . ministers had to be sure local government could deliver without  unreasonable council tax increases   he added. mr raynsford dismissed a suggestion the move was designed to keep council taxes down ahead of an expected general election.   this is a response to the concerns that have been voiced by local government about the pressures they face.  mr raynsford also plans to make savings of £100m by making changes to local government pensions schemes. these would raise the age from which retiring workers could claim their pensions and limit how much they received if they retired early. he insisted the changes were  very modest  and designed to tackle the problem of workers retiring  very early . but general secretary of the public services union unison dave prentis criticised the plans.  if you want world class public services you don t get that by hitting people as they approach retirement.,cabinet anger brown cash raid minist unhappi plan use whitehal cash keep council tax bill local govern minist nick raynsford acknowledg gordon brown realloc £m central local govern budget prebudget report thursday mr raynsford say held pretti frank discus fellow minist plan say local govern deliv good servic without big council tax rise central govern cash part £bn packag help local author england keep next year council tax rise like gener elect year mr raynsford say nearli central govern depart interest well run local author confirm row issu ministeri colleagu obvious pretti frank discus told bbc radio world one say recognit good settlement local govern import health educ govern depart minist sure local govern could deliv without unreason council tax increas ad mr raynsford dismiss suggest move design keep council tax ahead expect gener elect respons concern voic local govern pressur face mr raynsford also plan make save £m make chang local govern pension scheme would rais age retir worker could claim pension limit much receiv retir earli insist chang modest design tackl problem worker retir earli gener secretari public servic union unison dave prenti criticis plan want world class public servic get hit peopl approach retir
70,39,debate needed  on donations cap a cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet  the elections watchdog has said.  fears that big donors can buy political favours have sparked calls for a limit. in a new report  the electoral commission says it is worth debating a £10 000 cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it. it also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning.  there were almost £68m in reported donations to political parties in 2001  2002 and 2003  with nearly £12m of them from individual gifts worth more than £1m. the rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions. the commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash - something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work.  while we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap  we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible   says its report. if there was to be a cap  it should be £10 000 - a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned £56m in donations between 2001 and 2003.  even without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small-scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under £200. it also suggests increasing state funding for parties to £3m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the house of commons  european parliament  scottish parliament  welsh assembly or northern ireland assembly. and it suggests new ways of boosting election campaigning  seen as a way of improving voter turnout. all local election candidates should be entitled to a free mailshot for campaign leaflets  says the watchdog. and there should be a shift in the amount of money allowed to be spent at elections from a national level to a local level to help politicians engage better with voters.  the report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates  while cutting national spending limits from £20m to £15m. the commission also says the spending limits for general elections should cover the four months before the poll - as happens with other elections. electoral commission chairman sam younger said:  there is no doubt that political parties have a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy and for this they need to be adequately resourced.  our research has shown that people want to be more informed about party politics and that they want politicians to be more visible and accessible.  the public are reluctant for the state to fund parties but at the same time are unhappy with large private donations.  he called for a wider public debate on party funding to find the consensus needed for radical changes to the current system.,debat need donat cap cap donat polit parti introduc yet elect watchdog say fear big donor buy polit favour spark call limit new report elector commiss say worth debat £ cap futur right time introduc also say state fund polit parti candid abl spend elect campaign almost £m report donat polit parti nearli £m individu gift worth £m rule alreadi chang public see give much parti report say still public suspicion commiss say cap donat would mean taxpay give parti cash someth would first accept public show work principl oppos introduct donat cap believ major departur exist system would sensibl say report cap £ small enough amount make differ would ban £m donat even without chang commiss urg polit parti seek smallscal donat suggest incom tax relief gift £ also suggest increas state fund parti £m help extend parti least two member hous common european parliament scottish parliament welsh assembl northern ireland assembl suggest new way boost elect campaign see way improv voter turnout local elect candid entitl free mailshot campaign leaflet say watchdog shift amount money allow spent elect nation level local level help politician engag well voter report suggest doubl money spent candid cut nation spend limit £m £m commiss also say spend limit gener elect cover four month poll happen elect elector commiss chairman sam young say doubt polit parti vital role play maintain health democraci need adequ resourc research show peopl want inform parti polit want politician visibl access public reluct state fund parti time unhappi larg privat donat call wider public debat parti fund find consensu need radic chang current system

75,11,berlin cheers for anti-nazi film a german movie about an anti-nazi resistance heroine has drawn loud applause at berlin film festival.  sophie scholl - the final days portrays the final days of the member of the white rose movement. scholl  21  was arrested and beheaded with her brother  hans  in 1943 for distributing leaflets condemning the  abhorrent tyranny  of adolf hitler. director marc rothemund said:  i have a feeling of responsibility to keep the legacy of the scholls going.   we must somehow keep their ideas alive   he added.  the film drew on transcripts of gestapo interrogations and scholl s trial preserved in the archive of communist east germany s secret police. their discovery was the inspiration behind the film for rothemund  who worked closely with surviving relatives  including one of scholl s sisters  to ensure historical accuracy on the film. scholl and other members of the white rose resistance group first started distributing anti-nazi leaflets in the summer of 1942. they were arrested as they dropped leaflets at munich university calling for a  day of reckoning  with adolf hitler s regime. the film focuses on the six days from scholl s arrest to the intense trial which saw scholl initially deny the charges and ended with a defiant appearance. it is one of three german films vying for a top prize at the festival.  a south african film version of bizet s tragic opera carmen shot in cape town in the xhosa language has also premiered at the berlin festival. the film is entitled u-carmen ekhayelitsha or carmen in khayelitsha after the township in which the story is set. it is performed by a 40-strong music and theatre troupe in their debut film performance. the film is the first south african feature in 25 years and only the second to be nominated for a golden bear award.,berlin cheer antinazi film german movi antinazi resist heroin drawn loud applaus berlin film festiv sophi scholl final day portray final day member white rise movement scholl arrest behead brother han distribut leaflet condemn abhorr tyranni adolf hitler director marc rothemund say feel respons keep legaci scholl go must somehow keep idea aliv ad film drew transcript gestapo interrog scholl trial preserv archiv communist east germani secret polic discoveri inspir behind film rothemund work close surviv rel includ one scholl sister ensur histor accuraci film scholl member white rise resist group first start distribut antinazi leaflet summer arrest drop leaflet munich univers call day reckon adolf hitler regim film focus six day scholl arrest intens trial saw scholl initi deni charg end defiant appear one three german film vy top prize festiv south african film version bizet tragic opera carmen shot cape town xhosa languag also premier berlin festiv film entitl ucarmen ekhayelitsha carmen khayelitsha township stori set perform strong music theatr troup debut film perform film first south african featur year second nomin golden bear award
76,705,newest eu members underpin growth the european union s newest members will bolster europe s economic growth in 2005  according to a new report.  the eight central european states which joined the eu last year will see 4.6% growth  the united nations economic commission for europe (unece) said. in contrast  the 12 euro zone countries will put in a  lacklustre  performance  generating growth of only 1.8%. the global economy will slow in 2005  the unece forecasts  due to widespread weakness in consumer demand.  it warned that growth could also be threatened by attempts to reduce the united states  huge current account deficit which  in turn  might lead to significant volatility in exchange rates.  unece is forecasting average economic growth of 2.2% across the european union in 2005. however  total output across the euro zone is forecast to fall in 2004 from 1.9% to 1.8%. this is due largely to the faltering german economy  which shrank 0.2% in the last quarter of 2004. on monday  germany s bdb private banks association said the german economy would struggle to meet its 1.4% growth target in 2005.  separately  the bundesbank warned that germany s efforts to reduce its budget deficit below 3% of gdp presented  huge risks  given that headline economic growth was set to fall below 1% this year. publishing its 2005 economic survey  the unece said central european countries such as the czech republic and slovenia would provide the backbone of the continent s growth. smaller nations such as cyprus  ireland and malta would also be among the continent s best performing economies this year  it said. the uk economy  on the other hand  is expected to slow in 2005  with growth falling from 3.2% last year to 2.5%.  consumer demand will remain fragile in many of europe s largest countries and economies will be mostly driven by growth in exports.  in view of the fragility of factors of domestic growth and the dampening effects of the stronger euro on domestic economic activity and inflation  monetary policy in the euro area is likely to continue to  wait and see   the organisation said in its report. global economic growth is expected to fall from 5% in 2004 to 4.25% despite the continued strength of the chinese and us economies. the unece warned that attempts to bring about a controlled reduction in the us current account deficit could cause difficulties.  the orderly reversal of the deficit is a major challenge for policy makers in both the united states and other economies   it noted.,new eu member underpin growth european union new member bolster europ econom growth accord new report eight central european state join eu last year see growth unit nation econom commiss europ unec say contrast euro zone countri put lacklustr perform gener growth global economi slow unec forecast due widespread weak consum demand warn growth could also threaten attempt reduc unit state huge current account deficit turn might lead signific volatil exchang rate unec forecast averag econom growth across european union howev total output across euro zone forecast fall due larg falter german economi shrank last quarter monday germani bdb privat bank associ say german economi would struggl meet growth target separ bundesbank warn germani effort reduc budget deficit gdp present huge risk give headlin econom growth set fall year publish econom survey unec say central european countri czech republ slovenia would provid backbon contin growth small nation cypru ireland malta would also among contin best perform economi year say uk economi hand expect slow growth fall last year consum demand remain fragil mani europ large countri economi mostli driven growth export view fragil factor domest growth dampen effect strong euro domest econom activ inflat monetari polici euro area like continu wait see organis say report global econom growth expect fall despit continu strength chine u economi unec warn attempt bring control reduct u current account deficit could caus difficulti orderli revers deficit major challeng polici maker unit state economi note

78,1235,verizon  seals takeover of mci  verizon has won a takeover battle for us phone firm mci with a bid worth $6.8bn (£3.6bn)  reports say.  the two firms are expected to seal the deal on monday morning  according to news agency reports  despite what was thought to be a higher bid from qwest. the us telecoms market is consolidating fast  with former long-distance giant at&t being bought by former subsidiary sbc earlier this year for $16bn. mci exited bankruptcy in april  having gone bust under previous name worldcom. the bankruptcy followed its admission in 2002 that it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits.  shareholders lost about $180bn when the company collapsed  while 20 000 workers lost their jobs. former worldcom boss bernie ebbers is currently on trial  accused of overseeing an $11bn fraud. qwest has itself come under suspicion of sub-standard behaviour  paying the securities and exchange commission $250m in october to settle charges that it manipulated its results to keep wall street happy.  mci is the us s second-biggest long distance firm after at&t. consolidation in the us telecommunications industry has picked up in the past few months as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases. a merger between mci and verizon would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since october. last week  sbc communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone trailblazer at&t for about $16bn. buying mci would give either qwest or verizon access to mci s global network and business-based subscribers. the rationale is similar to the one underpinning sbc s at&t deal. verizon is by far the bigger company and has its own successful mobile arm - factors which may have swung the board in its favour since both suitors are offering a mixture of cash and shares.,verizon seal takeov mci verizon takeov battl u phone firm mci bid worth bn £bn report say two firm expect seal deal monday morn accord news agenc report despit thought high bid qwest u telecom market consolid fast former longdist giant att bought former subsidiari sbc earlier year bn mci exit bankruptci april go bust previou name worldcom bankruptci follow admiss illeg book expens inflat profit sharehold lose bn compani collaps worker lose job former worldcom bos berni ebber current trial accus overse bn fraud qwest come suspicion substandard behaviour pay secur exchang commiss m octob settl charg manipul result keep wall street happi mci u secondbiggest long distanc firm att consolid u telecommun industri pick past month compani look cut cost boost client base merger mci verizon would fifth billiondollar telecom deal sinc octob last week sbc commun agre buy former parent phone trailblaz att bn buy mci would give either qwest verizon access mci global network businessbas subscrib rational similar one underpin sbc att deal verizon far big compani success mobil arm factor may swung board favour sinc suitor offer mixtur cash share
79,1503,iran budget seeks state sell-offs iran s president  mohammad khatami  has unveiled a budget designed to expand public spending by 30% but loosen the islamic republic s dependence on oil.  the budget for the fiscal year starting on 21 march calls for the sell-off of 20% of the state s corporate holdings. mr khatami s second term as president ends on 1 august  making this his last budget. but opposition from members of parliament who have attacked previous privatisations could block his plans. elections in may 2004 ousted many of mr khatami s supporters in parliament in favour of more hard-line religious conservatives. late last year  they backed a law which would give parliament a veto over foreign investment. the ruling was a response to the involvement in telecoms and airport projects by turkish companies  which hardliners accused of doing business with israel. it came not long after the expediency council - iran s ultimate decision-maker - blessed mr khatami s policy of selling stakes in sectors protected by the constitution such as energy  transport  telecoms and banking. continued obstruction of foreign investment could get in the way not only of privatisation plans  but also of mr khatami s hope of modestly reducing the government s reliance on oil revenues.  in an address to the majlis  mr khatami predicted economic growth of 7.1% in 2005-6  up from 6.7% in the current year. he said he wanted to increase the 2005-6 budget to 1 546 trillion rials ($175.6bn; £93.6bn) from the previous year s 1 070 trillion. within that figure  taxation would rise to $14.3bn  a rise of over 40% from what is expected from the current year. in contrast  oil revenues were expected to fall to $14.1bn from $16bn in the year to march 2005.  current government expenditure should come from tax revenues   mr khatami said.  oil revenues should be used for productive investment.  mr khatami has already been blocked by parliament from reducing the subsidies on many products including bread and petrol  reducing his room to manoeuvre.,iran budget seek state selloff iran presid mohammad khatami unveil budget design expand public spend loosen islam republ depend oil budget fiscal year start march call selloff state corpor hold mr khatami second term presid end august make last budget opposit member parliament attack previou privatis could block plan elect may oust mani mr khatami support parliament favour hardlin religi conserv late last year back law would give parliament veto foreign invest rule respons involv telecom airport project turkish compani hardlin accus busi israel come long expedi council iran ultim decisionmak bless mr khatami polici sell stake sector protect constitut energi transport telecom bank continu obstruct foreign invest could get way privatis plan also mr khatami hope modestli reduc govern relianc oil revenu address majli mr khatami predict econom growth current year say want increas budget trillion rial bn £bn previou year trillion within figur taxat would rise bn rise expect current year contrast oil revenu expect fall bn bn year march current govern expenditur come tax revenu mr khatami say oil revenu use product invest mr khatami alreadi block parliament reduc subsidi mani product includ bread petrol reduc room manoeuvr

84,788,lse  sets date for takeover deal  the london stock exchange (lse) is planning to announce a preferred takeover by the end of the month  newspaper reports claim.  the sunday telegraph said the lse s plan was further evidence it wants to retain tight control over its destiny. both deutsche boerse and rival euronext held talks with the london market last week over a possible offer. a £1.3bn offer from deutsche boerse has already been rejected  while euronext has said it will make an all cash bid. speculation suggests that paris-based euronext has the facilities in place to make a bid of £1.4bn  while its german rival may up its bid to the £1.5bn mark. neither has yet tabled a formal bid  but the lse is expected to hold further talks with the two parties later this week. however  the sunday telegraph report added that there are signs that deutsche boerse chief executive werner seifert is becoming increasingly impatient with the lse s managed bid process.  despite insisting he wants to agree a recommended deal with the lse s board  the newspaper suggested he may pull out of the process and put an offer directly to shareholders instead. the newspaper also claimed mr seifert was becoming  increasingly frustrated  with the pace of negotiations since deutsche boerse s £1.3bn offer was rejected in mid-december  in particular the lse s decision to suspend talks over the christmas period. meanwhile  the german exchange s offer has come under fire recently. unions for deutsche boerse staff in frankfurt have reportedly expressed fears that up to 300 jobs would be moved to london if the takeover is successful. others claim it will weaken the city s status as europe s financial centre  while german politicians are also said to be angry over the market operator s promise to move its headquarters to london if a bid is successful. a further stumbling block is deutsche boerse s control over its clearstream unit  the clearing house that processes securities transactions. lse shareholders fear it would create a monopoly situation  weakening the position of shareholders when negotiating lower transaction fees for share dealings. lse and euronext do not have control over their clearing and settlement operations  a situation which critics say is more transparent and competitive.,lse set date takeov deal london stock exchang lse plan announc prefer takeov end month newspap report claim sunday telegraph say lse plan evid want retain tight control destini deutsch boer rival euronext held talk london market last week possibl offer £bn offer deutsch boer alreadi reject euronext say make cash bid specul suggest parisbas euronext facil place make bid £bn german rival may bid £bn mark neither yet tabl formal bid lse expect hold talk two parti later week howev sunday telegraph report ad sign deutsch boer chief execut werner seifert becom increasingli impati lse manag bid process despit insist want agre recommend deal lse board newspap suggest may pull process put offer directli sharehold instead newspap also claim mr seifert becom increasingli frustrat pace negoti sinc deutsch boer £bn offer reject middecemb particular lse decis suspend talk christma period meanwhil german exchang offer come fire recent union deutsch boer staff frankfurt reportedli express fear job would move london takeov success other claim weaken citi statu europ financi centr german politician also say angri market oper promis move headquart london bid success stumbl block deutsch boer control clearstream unit clear hous process secur transact lse sharehold fear would creat monopoli situat weaken posit sharehold negoti low transact fee share deal lse euronext control clear settlement oper situat critic say transpar competit

86,1649,prutton poised for lengthy fa ban southampton s david prutton faces a possible seven-match ban when he goes before the football association.  the 23-year-old has admitted two charges of improper conduct following his dismissal against arsenal. the first charge relates to his failure to leave the field promptly  pushing referee alan wiley and remonstrating with assistant referee paul norman. and the second charge is for using threatening words and/or behaviour to a match official during the 1-1 draw.  paolo di canio was given a seven-match suspension when he pushed referee paul alcock over in a premiership game between sheffield wednesday and arsenal in 1998. prutton will be joined at wednesday s hearing by saints boss harry redknapp  who believes that the fa will throw the book at his player. redknapp himself sprinted along the touchline to help physio jim joyce and coach denis rofe shepherd the enraged prutton away from referee s assistant norman.  david has made a big mistake and he knows it. i can t condone what he s done. he was out of order but he knows that   said redknapp.  he s a decent lad. he over-reacted badly for some reason - he had a rush of blood from somewhere. off the pitch you couldn t meet a nicer lad.  prutton has apologised publicly for his actions and to arsenal s robert pires  who was injured in a wild tackle by the saints  midfield man.  he said:  it s an horrendous situation. i apologise to the ref and linesman  who were only doing their job.  i ve also seen what happened to pires  leg and i m sorry for that as well.   i apologise for the people who saw it. i know you get lots of kids going to the match now and they don t pay money to see that sort of thing.  it s not a cop-out  but it was all a bit of a blur. sometimes you react and it s beyond your control    added prutton.,prutton poi lengthi fa ban southampton david prutton face possibl sevenmatch ban goe footbal associ yearold admit two charg improp conduct follow dismiss arsen first charg relat failur leav field promptli push refere alan wiley remonstr assist refere paul norman second charg use threaten word andor behaviour match offici draw paolo di canio give sevenmatch suspens push refere paul alcock premiership game sheffield wednesday arsen prutton join wednesday hear saint bos harri redknapp believ fa throw book player redknapp sprint along touchlin help physio jim joyc coach deni rofe shepherd enrag prutton away refere assist norman david make big mistak know condon do order know say redknapp decent lad overreact badli reason rush blood somewher pitch meet nicer lad prutton apologis publicli action arsen robert pire injur wild tackl saint midfield man say horrend situat apologis ref linesman job also see happen pire leg sorri well apologis peopl saw know get lot kid go match pay money see sort thing copout bit blur sometim react beyond control ad prutton
87,1110,quake s economic costs emerging asian governments and international agencies are reeling at the potential economic devastation left by the asian tsunami and floods.  world bank president james wolfensohn has said his agency is  only beginning to grasp the magnitude of the disaster  and its economic impact. the tragedy has left at least 25 000 people dead  with sri lanka  thailand  india and indonesia worst hit. some early estimates of reconstruction costs are starting to emerge. millions have been left homeless  while businesses and infrastructure have been washed away.  economists believe several of the 10 countries hit by the giant waves could see a slowdown in growth.  in sri lanka  some observers have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost. for thailand  that figure is much lower at 0.1%. governments are expected to take steps  such as cutting taxes and increasing spending  to facilitate a recovery.   with the enormous displacement of people...there will be a serious relaxation of fiscal policy   glenn maguire  chief economist for the region at societe generale  told agence france presse.  the economic impact of it will certainly be large  but it should not be enough to derail the momentum of the region in 2005   he said.  first and foremost this is a human tragedy.  india s economy  however  is less likely to slow because the areas hit are some of the least developed. the regional giant has enjoyed strong growth in 2004. but india now faces other problems  with aid workers under pressure to ensure a clean supply of water and sanitation to prevent an outbreak of disease.  thailand s prime minister thaksin shinawatra has estimated the destruction at 20bn baht ($510m). analysts said that figure is likely to rise and the country s tourist industry is likely to be hardest hit. thailand s fishing and real estate sectors also will be affected by sunday s 9.0 magnitude earthquake  which sent huge waves from malaysia to africa. malaysia said as many as 1 000 fishermen will be affected and that damage to the industry will be  significant   agence france presse reported. rapid rebuilding will be key to limiting the impact of the tragedy.  in three months  we should rebuild 70% of the damage in the three worst hit provinces   said juthamas siriwan  governor of the tourism authority of thailand. the outlook for sri lanka is less optimistic  with analysts predicting that the country s tourist industry will struggle to recovery quickly. tourism is a vital to many developing countries  providing jobs for 19 million people in the south east asian region  according to the world travel and tourism council (wttc).,quak econom cost emerg asian govern intern agenc reel potenti econom devast left asian tsunami flood world bank presid jame wolfensohn say agenc begin grasp magnitud disast econom impact tragedi left least peopl dead sri lanka thailand india indonesia bad hit earli estim reconstruct cost start emerg million left homeless busi infrastructur wash away economist believ sever countri hit giant wave could see slowdown growth sri lanka observ say much annual growth may lose thailand figur much low govern expect take step cut tax increas spend facilit recoveri enorm displac peoplether seriou relax fiscal polici glenn maguir chief economist region societ general told agenc franc press econom impact certainli larg enough derail momentum region say first foremost human tragedi india economi howev less like slow area hit least develop region giant enjoy strong growth india face problem aid worker pressur ensur clean suppli water sanit prevent outbreak diseas thailand prime minist thaksin shinawatra estim destruct bn baht m analyst say figur like rise countri tourist industri like hardest hit thailand fish real estat sector also affect sunday magnitud earthquak sent huge wave malaysia africa malaysia say mani fisherman affect damag industri signific agenc franc press report rapid rebuild key limit impact tragedi three month rebuild damag three bad hit provinc say juthama siriwan governor tourism author thailand outlook sri lanka less optimist analyst predict countri tourist industri struggl recoveri quickli tourism vital mani develop countri provid job million peopl south east asian region accord world travel tourism council wttc
88,2107,us trade deficit widens sharply the gap between us exports and imports has widened to more than $60bn (£31.7bn)  an all-time record.  figures from the commerce department for november showed exports down 2.3% to $95.6bn  while imports grew 1.3% to $155.8bn on rising consumer demand. part of the expanding deficit came from high prices for oil imports. but the numbers suggested the sliding dollar - which makes exports less expensive - has had little impact  and could indicate slowing economic growth.  the trade deficit - far bigger than the $54bn widely expected on wall street - prompted a rapid response from the currency markets.  by 1650 gmt  the dollar was trading against the euro at $1.3280  almost a cent and a half weaker than before the announcement. against the pound  the dollar was down about 0.7% at $1 8923.  the dollar s fall has been sudden  violent and appropriate given this number   said brian taylor of wells fargo in minneapolis.  recent exchange rate movements certainly haven t had any impact yet.  treasury secretary john snow put a brave face on the news  saying it was a sign of strong economic expansion.  the economy is growing at such a fast rate that it is generating lots of disposable income... some of which is used to buy goods from our trading partners.   although the white house officially still backs the us s traditional  strong dollar  policy  it has tacitly indicated that it would be happy if the slide continued. the dollar has fallen by 50% against the euro - as well as by 30% against the yen - in the past three years. the main catalyst  most economists accept  is the large budget deficit on the one hand  and the current account deficit - the difference between the flow of money in and out of the us - on the other. the trade deficit is a large part of the latter. in november  the fall in exports was largely due to a decline in sales of industrial supplies and materials such as chemicals  as well as of cars  consumer goods and food. one small bright spot for us policy-makers was a slight decline in the deficit with china  often blamed for job losses and other economic woes. although china s overall trade surplus is expanding  according to chinese government figures  the commerce department revealed the us s deficit with china was $19.6bn in november  down from $19.7bn the month before. but the deficit with japan was at its worst in more than four years.,u trade deficit widen sharpli gap u export import widen bn £bn alltim record figur commerc depart novemb show export bn import grow bn rise consum demand part expand deficit come high price oil import number suggest slide dollar make export less expens littl impact could indic slow econom growth trade deficit far big bn wide expect wall street prompt rapid respons currenc market gmt dollar trade euro almost cent half weaker announc pound dollar dollar fall sudden violent appropri give number say brian taylor well fargo minneapoli recent exchang rate movement certainli impact yet treasuri secretari john snow put brave face news say sign strong econom expans economi grow fast rate gener lot dispos incom use buy good trade partner although white hous offici still back u tradit strong dollar polici tacitli indic would happi slide continu dollar fall euro well yen past three year main catalyst economist accept larg budget deficit one hand current account deficit differ flow money u trade deficit larg part latter novemb fall export larg due declin sale industri suppli materi chemic well car consum good food one small bright spot u policymak slight declin deficit china often blame job loss econom woe although china overal trade surplu expand accord chine govern figur commerc depart reveal u deficit china bn novemb bn month deficit japan bad four year
89,804,software watching while you work software that can not only monitor every keystroke and action performed at a pc but also be used as legally binding evidence of wrong-doing has been unveiled.  worries about cyber-crime and sabotage have prompted many employers to consider monitoring employees. the developers behind the system claim it is a break-through in the way data is monitored and stored. but privacy advocates are concerned by the invasive nature of such software.  the system is a joint venture between security firm 3ami and storage specialists bridgehead software. they have joined forces to create a system which can monitor computer activity  store it and retrieve disputed files within minutes. more and more firms are finding themselves in deep water as a result of data misuse. sabotage and data theft are most commonly committed from within an organisation according to the national hi-tech crime unit (nhtcu) a survey conducted on its behalf by nop found evidence that more than 80% of medium and large companies have been victims of some form of cyber-crime. bridgehead software has come up with techniques to prove  to a legal standard  that any stored file on a pc has not been tampered with. ironically the impetus for developing the system came as a result of the freedom of information act  which requires companies to store all data for a certain amount of time.  the storage system has been incorporated into an application developed by security firm 3ami which allows every action on a computer to be logged. potentially it could help employers to follow the trail of stolen files and pinpoint whether they had been emailed to a third party  copied  printed  deleted or saved to cd  floppy disk  memory stick or flash card. other activities the system can monitor include the downloading of pornography  the use of racist or bullying language or the copying of applications for personal use. increasingly organisations that handle sensitive data  such as governments  are using biometric log-ins such as fingerprinting to provide conclusive proof of who was using a particular machine at any given time. privacy advocates are concerned that monitoring at work is not only damaging to employee s privacy but also to the relationship between employers and their staff.  that is not the case   said tim ellsmore  managing director of 3ami.  it is not about replacing dialogue but there are issues that you can talk through but you still need proof   he said.  people need to recognise that you are using a pc as a representative of a company and that employers have a legal requirement to store data   he added.,softwar watch work softwar monitor everi keystrok action perform pc also use legal bind evid wrongdo unveil worri cybercrim sabotag prompt mani employ consid monitor employe develop behind system claim breakthrough way data monitor store privaci advoc concern invas natur softwar system joint ventur secur firm ami storag specialist bridgehead softwar join forc creat system monitor comput activ store retriev disput file within minut firm find deep water result data misus sabotag data theft commonli commit within organis accord nation hitech crime unit nhtcu survey conduct behalf nop found evid medium larg compani victim form cybercrim bridgehead softwar come techniqu prove legal standard store file pc tamper iron impetu develop system come result freedom inform act requir compani store data certain amount time storag system incorpor applic develop secur firm ami allow everi action comput log potenti could help employ follow trail steal file pinpoint whether email third parti copi print delet save cd floppi disk memori stick flash card activ system monitor includ download pornographi use racist bulli languag copi applic person use increasingli organis handl sensit data govern use biometr login fingerprint provid conclus proof use particular machin give time privaci advoc concern monitor work damag employe privaci also relationship employ staff case say tim ellsmor manag director ami replac dialogu issu talk still need proof say peopl need recognis use pc repres compani employ legal requir store data ad

94,1126,parmalat founder offers apology the founder and former boss of parmalat has apologised to investors who lost money as a result of the italian dairy firm s collapse.  calisto tanzi said he would co-operate fully with prosecutors investigating the background to one of europe s largest financial scandals. parmalat was placed into bankruptcy protection in 2003 after a 14bn euro black hole was found in its accounts. more than 130 000 people lost money following the firm s collapse. mr tanzi  66  issued a statement through his lawyer after five hours of questioning by prosecutors in parma on 15 january.  prosecutors are seeking indictments against mr tanzi and 28 others - including several members of his family and former parmalat chief financial officer fausto tonna - for alleged manipulation of stock market prices and making misleading statements to accountants and italy s financial watchdog. two former parmalat auditors will stand trial later this month for their role in the firm s collapse.   i apologise to all who have suffered so much damage as a result of my schemes to make my dream of an industrial project come true   mr tanzi s statement said.  it is my duty to collaborate fully with prosecutors to reconstruct the causes of parmalat s sudden default and who is responsible.  mr tanzi spent several months in jail in the wake of parmalat s collapse and was kept under house arrest until last september. parmalat is now being run by a state appointed administrator  enrico bondi  who has launched lawsuits against 80 banks in an effort to recover money for the bankrupt company and its shareholders. he has alleged that these companies were aware of the true state of parmalat s finances but continued to lend money to the company. the companies insist they were the victims of fraudulent book-keeping. parmalat was declared insolvent after it emerged that 4 billion euros (£2.8bn; $4.8bn) it supposedly held in an offshore account did not in fact exist. the firm s demise sent shock waves through italy  where its portfolio of top-selling food brands and its position as the owner of leading football club parma had turned it into a household name.,parmalat founder offer apolog founder former bos parmalat apologis investor lose money result italian dairi firm collaps calisto tanzi say would cooper fulli prosecutor investig background one europ large financi scandal parmalat place bankruptci protect bn euro black hole found account peopl lose money follow firm collaps mr tanzi issu statement lawyer five hour question prosecutor parma januari prosecutor seek indict mr tanzi other includ sever member famili former parmalat chief financi offic fausto tonna alleg manipul stock market price make mislead statement account itali financi watchdog two former parmalat auditor stand trial later month role firm collaps apologis suffer much damag result scheme make dream industri project come true mr tanzi statement say duti collabor fulli prosecutor reconstruct caus parmalat sudden default respons mr tanzi spent sever month jail wake parmalat collaps kept hous arrest last septemb parmalat run state appoint administr enrico bondi launch lawsuit bank effort recov money bankrupt compani sharehold alleg compani awar true state parmalat financ continu lend money compani compani insist victim fraudul bookkeep parmalat declar insolv emerg billion euro £bn bn supposedli held offshor account fact exist firm demis sent shock wave itali portfolio topsel food brand posit owner lead footbal club parma turn household name
95,1605,kilroy launches  veritas  party ex-bbc chat show host and east midlands mep robert kilroy-silk said he wanted to  change the face of british politics  as he launched his new party. mr kilroy-silk  who recently quit the uk independence party  said  our country  was being  stolen from us  by mass immigration. he told a london news conference that veritas - latin for  truth  - would avoid the old parties   lies and spin . ukip leader roger knapman says he is glad to see the back of mr kilroy-silk.  mr kilroy-silk promised a  firm but fair  policy on immigration and said they hoped to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election. he said veritas would also announce detailed policies on crime  tax  pensions  health and defence over the next few weeks. labour campaign spokesman fraser kemp said veritas was joining  an already crowded field on the right of british politics . on thursday mr kilroy-silk is due to announce which constituency he will run in at the next general election - that will come amid speculation he has his sights set on defence secretary geoff hoon s ashfield seat. he was joined in the new venture by one of ukip s two london assembly members  damien hockney who is now veritas  deputy leader. ukip s chairman petrina holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left.  mr kilroy-silk quit ukip last week after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party. he said he was ashamed to be a member of a ukip whose leadership had  gone awol  after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last june s european elections.  while ukip has turned its back on the british people  i shall not   he said.  i will be standing at the next general election. i shall be leading a vigorous campaign for the causes i believe in.  and  unlike the old parties  we shall be honest  open and straight.   mr hockney also left ukip saying mr kilroy-silk would  deliver better  as the leader of a eurosceptic party. a spokesman for ukip called on mr hockney to quit the london assembly. the party asserts that mr hockney  has a moral obligation  if not a legal one  to stand down. its leader  roger knapman  has said he is glad to see the back of mr kilroy-silk.  he has remarkable ability to influence people but  sadly  after the [european] election it became clear that he was more interested in the robert kilroy-silk party than the uk independence party so it was nice knowing him  now  goodbye    he said. ukip officials also argue mr kilroy-silk has not been  straightforward  in attacking the party he once wanted to lead.  veritas  it s the bnp in an expensive suit!  it s all well and good robert kilroy-silk claiming  that  veritas  is a party that doesn t believe in  lies and spin   but the truth of the matter is  its completely useless  due to proportional representation  there is no chance that  veritas  will have any chance in claiming power  and change the two-horse race trend. in my opinion this is just a publicity stunt which has just been used as a smoke-screen for his anti-islamism slurs which got him sacked from the television.  i think that his views regarding immigration are shared by many. it really is time that the uk government ceased to be a paper tiger on this issue. in addition as an ashfield constituent i would be more than interested in kilroy -silk opposing geoff hoon!!  good to see the parties of the right splintering in the way the parties of the left have always done. let s hope kilroy-silk  ukip and the euro-sceptic wing of the tory party all fade further into obscurity so we can have some truth in the debate about europe. we benefit enormously from our membership of the eu  we need to be at the heart of europe  leading it and driving it to where we as a country want to go  not running away from it.  all mouth and trousers. a clown. trouble is  any votes he collects may just end up helping new labour into a third term.  whatever kilroy-silk and ukip do  none of their anti-european policies have any relevance outside middle england. this new party might gain support from right-wing england  but will have little impact in wales or scotland.  hopefully this all this fighting within euro-sceptic parties will allow them to slip out of the way and get people voting for real political parties which address more than one issue. england needs europe to survive and as soon as people realise this the better  we can t rely on the usa forever!  at last an impetus for increasing the likely 40% turn out for the election. the electorate is disillusioned with british politics. kilroy has one agenda - the uk - and i ll be voting for him.  both ukip and rk-s are representatives of small-mindedness and a lack of vision for the whole of humankind. the interests of humanity and the world lie so much beyond the scope of these people s bickering that who  in the overall scheme of things  really cares about their petty tiff   many people believe you kilroy. you may even believe yourself but switching horses midstream and then bad mouthing the steed that got you halfway seriously diminishes your credibility.  the very idea of political parties born out of such negative feelings as euroscepticism or british supremacy is nauseating. one can only hope the public recognise these extremists for what they are and shun them at the polls.  i ve always thought that kilroy-silk was a self-publicising  egotist and this news does absolutely nothing to alter my opinion.  brilliant  about time this country had a plausible party!  having seen the recent bbc 3 documentary and witnessed the thoroughly disgraceful chauvinistic behaviour of a number of senior ukip figures i can well understand why kilroy-silk feels embarrassed to be associated with such people. hopefully the ukip members who are interested in the political debate will support his action.  fantastic news. pro-europeans now have far less to worry about from the right. the conservatives are as confused as they have been since the mid-1990s  and the extreme anti-europeans are fracturing themselves into splinter groups that split any votes they might get in local  european and general elections. robert kilroy-silk s ego and vanity are his own (and his supporters ) worst enemy.  as a euro-enthusiast i could not be more delighted by kilroy-silk s behaviour. he took a party that was just building up a head of steam  and having exposed it to ridicule by attempting a coup-d etat  he is now setting about the serious business of dividing it in two. the closer to straight-down-the-middle the better  as far as i am concerned  but in any eventuality  the two sceptic parties will exhaust their energies fighting each other.  if every politician with ambitions to lead their party resorted to forming their own for that purpose  we d have ballot papers a mile long! you ve got to hand it to kilroy-silk for his sheer arrogance and supreme self-belief.  whilst not being a great fan of kilroy i do agree with his comments about the ukip leadership  and like him i am also leaving ukip. i believe countless opportunities have been lost to discredit the eu and to show our people what belonging to the eu really means. the eu s comments last week about michael howard s plans to reform immigration show how little we govern our own country when they can turn round and say immigration is a matter for the eu and not individual member states. the sooner we leave this corrupt super-state the better  does anyone else think that it is ironic that euro-sceptic kilroy-silk has used a latin name for his new party  rather than a  good old british  name  is this indicative of the man - contradictory  vain and pompous   i think mr kilroy-silk has got a very good point. british politics has become too pc and as a result has no straight talking honest strong politicians. they are all interested in their own careers and not the people who put them in power. as a result i feel our democracy is being abused and i want it stopped. if mr kilroy-silk lives up to half his promises he will get my vote.  honestly  who really cares  man with tan leaves party with no plan  to set up party with no idea.  as one of kilroy-silk s east midlands constituents i hope those who voted for him are proud to have been taken in by such charming vacuity. i feel insulted by having him represent me in the european parliament.  ukip tried hard to accommodate robert kilroy silk  but he made it clear that only control of it would satisfy him. someone so keen on complete control was bound to fall foul of ukip s democratic nature.  kilroy is an able communicator and a capable politician  in exactly the way those who lead ukip are not. he tried to make it work  but they didn t seem to want to grow up. he was left in the position of having to defend their gaffes to the media. this new party seems a logical next step for kilroy. good luck to the man  i say.  oh please! this is an amusing irrelevance. there is absolutely no chance of either of these parties communicating a sensible and constructive  eurosceptic  argument. they will play a key part in winning the country round to the idea of a reformed  more democratic  more dynamic europe union. future generations will thank him for his ridiculousness.  the refreshing thing about robert is that he is open  honest and straight. what other politician can claim this. i have a suspicion that he talks for a larger part of the electorate that his critics would like. i shall be voting for him.  the electorate of the east midlands voted not for kilroy-silk but for the ukip. kilroy-silk was made an mep because of his position on the ukip s party list. he has no mandate to represent the area and should resign from the european parliament.  i wouldn t write off kilroy-silk. while he s a clown and a one man band at the moment  he s a populist and that s always dangerous.the man clearly has an enormous ego and looking at our current political masters  that seems to be one of the factors in success.  good luck to kilroy though i think he is doing more harm than good for both his new party and ukip because their vote base is not strong enough for both parties to be successful and at the moment ukip have the upper hand while veritas are starting from square one and fighting a somewhat uphill battle.  the man i once found cringe worthy on day time tv  could well turn out to be my country s knight in shining armour. he expresses views which are now more than common amongst society today - but people are almost too scared to express them. kilroy silk has secured my vote  and many more like me. what s more  i look forward to the day when he claims victory  wrecks the eu  and rescues my great nation... without a hair out of place and his tan as perfect as ever!  great stuff. the longer the uk dithers over europe  the richer we in ireland become  as the only english-speaking country fully committed to europe. oh and send us over those hard-working immigrants - our economy needs them.  this is just what the europhiles pray for. as the main eurosceptic party  ukip should try to resolve its differences with kilroy to show a united front and give the uk public a serious political voice against europe. having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote further.  thank goodness that kilroy-silk has gone - now ukip at least has a chance in the election!  it is very sad to see the cause of britain regaining its proper relationship with europe damaged by this split within ukip. robert kilroy-silk could have a lot to offer. instead we have a split party and a damaged cause. under the present electoral system  people must work together  and small parties have no hope of representation. last summer  ukip achieved a major advance  partly and only partly due to kilroy-silk. it is a great shame this has been dissipated in in-fighting.  ukip has a wide platform of policies  not just withdrawal from the eu. this kilroy-silk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party. neither the english democrats nor the new party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volumes. veritas is the beginning of the end for kilroy-silk.  if he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a by-elections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another.  so ukip was good enough for him to lead  not good enough for him to follow!  interesting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a latin name!  every opinion poll points to an overwhelming anti-europe feeling in this country. kilroy-silk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue. he is an extremely able communicator with years of political experience. we wants quality schools  top hospitals  clean and efficient public transport  punishments that fit the crime  limited asylum  a purge on bureaucracy and less taxes. it needs courage and honesty  two qualities sadly lacking in our politicians. kilroy-silk may just have those very qualities. recruit the right colleagues  robert  and your time may have come!  well if you cannot get enough limelight being an ordinary mp then go out and start up your own party. it s all flash and no real policy here  let s hope this is the start of both ukip and kilroy-silk slipping into obscurity.  veritas  the name will doom it. but perhaps i am wrong for surely all modern schoolchildren will understand it since they do still learn latin in the classroom do they not  the whole essence of what rks represents is euroscepticism  so explain to me how the too-twee label of veritas symbolises that,kilroy launch verita

96,1215,toxic web links help virus spread virus writers have begun using the power of the web to spread their malicious wares.  a windows virus called bofra is turning infected machines into distributors of its malicious code. those clicking on the poisoned links in e-mail messages sent out by infected machines may fall victim to the virus. the trick is being used to prevent the progam being caught by anti-virus software that combs through code contained in e-mail attachments.  the virus that uses this trick is called bofra and the first member of the family of worms appeared on 10 november. they exploit a windows vulnerability that was discovered only a few days earlier.  like many other recent viruses  bofra plunders the address book in microsoft outlook for e-mail addresses and scours other files on an infected machine for fresh target addresses. the virus uses its own mail sending software to despatch e-mail messages to potential victims but  unlike many other recent viruses  does not itself travel via mail. instead the body of the mail messages sent out contain fake weblinks that  when clicked on  connect back to the machine that distributed that e-mail. essentially  bofra turns infected machines into small web servers that happily dole out copies of the virus. the messages try to trick people into clicking on the links by promising pornographic videos and images or by posing as payment confirmation for a paypal transaction.  copies of the messages seen by the bbc news website had bright yellow and green backgrounds. those clicking on the links will inadvertently download the bofra virus which will then start searching for new addresses to send itself to. filtering firm clearswift said this tactic of creating thousands of mini web servers was designed to help the virus spread quickly and avoid attempts to shut it down. in the past other malicious programs have relied on a single web server that downloads viral code to target machines. shutting down this central server usually stops the virus spreading.  clearswift said that fact that no viral code travels in the e-mail messages sent out by machines infected by bofra could hamper effects to limit its spread. finnish anti-virus firm f-secure said that  so far  it had not seen many copies of the bofra virus and its variants in circulation.  tim warner  spokesman for anti-virus firm finjan  said:  you have people getting very creative now to deliver the virus and get it propagating.  mr warner said organisations needed to prepare deep defences to keep out the modern form of malicious mobile code.  most firms have secured their e-mail gateway   said mr warner   but the irony is that most of them let malicious content through the web gateways.  he said behavioural systems that monitor what users do can help to spot when viruses have penetrated organisations and have started hunting for other victims. the bofra family of viruses  which were originally thought to be offshoots of the mydoom bug  can infect machines running windows 2000  95  98  me  nt  xp and server 2003. users running windows xp that have applied the sp2 update are not vulnerable to the loophole that bofra exploits.,toxic web link help viru spread viru writer begin use power web spread malici ware window viru call bofra turn infect machin distributor malici code

99,929,mallon wades into ne vote battle middlesbrough mayor ray mallon has been drafted in to boost the yes campaign as the north east assembly referendum enters its final week.  the former police chief  dubbed robocop for his zero tolerance style  clashed on thursday with sunderland no campaigner neil herron. mr mallon said an assembly would give local people more of a say over key issues such as transport and crime. but mr herron said north east people did not want or need an assembly.  the pair met on the platform at sunderland station as mr mallon toured the region highlighting claimed improvements to transport if the area gets an assembly. but mr herron - who gained fame as one of sunderland s  metric martyrs  and is running his own no campaign alongside the official north east says no campaign - said he was not convinced by mr mallon s arguments.  the reality is that it is not going to deliver   he said.  labour has had two-and-a-half years to convince people of this. if you can t sell a deal in that time  it is a bad deal.  on wednesday  mr mallon provoked fury by branding the official no campaign  two-bit tories  in a confrontation outside its durham headquarters.  the campaign is being run by two-bit conservatives who are not interested in what happens in the north east; they are interested in hitting the labour party over the head   he said. mr mallon is a late recruit to the yes campaign after rejecting overtures from no campaigners including  he claims  tory leader michael howard.  most local observers believe the contest is too close to call  although little recent polling has been carried out. yes campaign chairman john tomaney said he hoped for a late flurry of votes to boost turnout - something he says will boost their cause. he added:  the government exerts a lot of political power in the north east. the accountability should be in the north east as well.  he also defended the decision to attack the official no campaign s alleged political allegiances.  we felt we had to show what people were behind the no campaign - london tory spin doctors.  graham robb  spokesman for north east says no  said the yes campaign s decision to get personal dragged the campaign  into the gutter  and showed they were  rattled . and he hit back at mr mallon s claim that an assembly would improve transport links in the region.  it can push paper around but it can not get people moving   he said. some 487 939 people had returned their ballot papers by wednesday - a turnout of 25.7%. the deadline for voting is next thursday  4 november.,mallon wade ne vote battl middlesbrough mayor ray mallon draft boost ye campaign north east assembl referendum enter final week former polic chief dub robocop zero toler style clash thursday sunderland campaign neil herron mr mallon say assembl would give local peopl say key issu transport crime mr herron say north east peopl want need assembl pair met platform sunderland station mr mallon tour region highlight claim improv transport area get assembl mr herron gain fame one sunderland metric martyr run campaign alongsid offici north east say campaign say convinc mr mallon argument realiti go deliv say labour twoandahalf year convinc peopl sell deal time bad deal wednesday mr mallon provok furi brand offici campaign twobit torus confront outsid durham headquart campaign run twobit conserv interest happen north east interest hit labour parti head say mr mallon late recruit ye campaign reject overtur campaign includ claim torus leader michael howard local observ believ contest close call although littl recent poll carri ye campaign chairman john tomaney say hope late flurri vote boost turnout someth say boost caus ad govern exert lot polit power north east account north east well also defend decis attack offici campaign alleg polit allegi felt show peopl behind campaign london torus spin doctor graham robb spokesman north east say say ye campaign decis get person drag campaign gutter show rattl hit back mr mallon claim assembl would improv transport link region push paper around get peopl move say peopl return ballot paper wednesday turnout deadlin vote next thursday novemb

101,641,conservative backing for id cards the tories are to back controversial government plans to introduce id cards.  the shadow cabinet revealed its support ahead of next week s commons vote on a bill to introduce compulsory id. the decision follows a  tough meeting  where some senior tories argued vociferously against the move  party sources told the bbc. the bill  which ministers claim will tackle crime  terrorism and illegal immigration  is expected to be opposed by the liberal democrats.  they have said the scheme is  deeply flawed  and a waste of money. sources within the conservative party told the bbc michael howard has always been in favour of id cards  and tried to introduce them when he was home secretary. the party has been  agnostic  on the issue until now but had now decided to come off the fence  the tory source said. despite giving their backing to id cards  the conservatives insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme.  they said they would also press labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the home office would deliver them. and they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of id cards and whether people s privacy would be properly protected.  it is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect   a spokesman said.  it will do nothing to solve the immediate problems of rising crime and uncontrolled immigration.   lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten said:  this has all the signs of michael howard overruling colleagues  concerns over id cards.  the tories should have the courage to try and change public opinion not follow it.  the new chairman of the bar council  guy mansfield qc warned there was a real risk that people on the  margins of society  would be driven into the hands of extremists.  what is going to happen to young asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere  they are going to be stopped. if they haven t [id cards] they are going to be detained.,conserv back id card torus back controversi govern plan introduc id card shadow cabinet reveal support ahead next week common vote bill introduc compulsori id decis follow tough meet senior torus argu vocifer move parti sourc told bbc bill minist claim tackl crime terror illeg immigr expect oppos liber democrat say scheme deepli flaw wast money sourc within conserv parti told bbc michael howard alway favour id card tri introduc home secretari parti agnost issu decid come fenc torus sourc say despit give back id card conserv insist would hold minist account precis purpos scheme say would also press labour whether object could met whether home offic would deliv pledg ass cost effect id card whether peopl privaci would properli protect import rememb bill take decad come full effect spokesman say noth solv immedi problem rise crime uncontrol immigr lib dem home affair spokesman mark oaten say sign michael howard overrul colleagu concern id card torus courag tri chang public opinion follow new chairman bar council guy mansfield qc warn real risk peopl margin societi would driven hand extremist go happen young asian men bomb go somewher go stop id card go detain

103,2046,benitez delight after crucial win liverpool manager rafael benitez admitted victory against deportivo la coruna was vital in their tight champions league group.  jorge andrade s early own goal gave liverpool a 1-0 win. and benitez said:  we started at a very high tempo and had many chances. it is a very important win for us and we could have scored more goals.  we were very good defensively and also good on the counter attack. we are pleased but move on to the next game.  igor biscan was outstanding in midfield after replacing injured xabi alonso  and benitez said:  he played very well.  it is important to have all the players ready and a good squad so you can play more games at a high level.  benitez added:  it is all back in our own hands now  it was a great win for us and i was delighted with what i feel was the best liverpool i have seen.  as far as my feelings about winning in spain  that is really not important.  i want to see us win away matches in the champions league  that it was in spain was not my first consideration.  as far as i am concerned it is important for liverpool to win  it is not important in what country it is in.  benitez added: benitez said:  we had a problem before the start  it was decided that xabi could not play more than 45 minutes.  but in the end because of the way that (dietmar) hamann and (igor) biscan performed  we did not need to change things until right at the end of the match.  depor are a good team and if you allow them to keep possession they can be very dangerous indeed.  but we knew that if we hit them on the counter-attack it would make them nervous  and that is how it worked out.  deportivo coach javier irureta said:  liverpool played very well and we just could not break them down.  i know we have now gone six games at home in europe without scoring  but that does not reflect our overall performances.  but this time we did not play well and we lacked imagination.  the goal was a bad mistake and a big blow to our confidence. players who usually want the ball at that stage did not want it.  i know we are bottom of the group  but as long as there is hope of qualifying  we will hang on to that.,benitez delight crucial win liverpool manag rafael benitez admit victori deportivo la coruna vital tight champion leagu group jorg andrad earli goal give liverpool win benitez say start high tempo mani chanc import win u could score goal good defens also good counter attack plea move next game igor biscan outstand midfield replac injur xabi alonso benitez say play well import player readi good squad play game high level benitez ad back hand great win u delight feel best liverpool see far feel win spain realli import want see u win away match champion leagu spain first consider far concern import liverpool win import countri benitez ad benitez say problem start decid xabi could play minut end way dietmar hamann igor biscan perform need chang thing right end match depor good team allow keep posse danger inde knew hit counterattack would make nervou work deportivo coach javier irureta say liverpool play well could break know go six game home europ without score reflect overal perform time play well lack imagin goal bad mistak big blow confid player usual want ball stage want know bottom group long hope qualifi hang
104,1326,ask jeeves joins web log market ask jeeves has bought the bloglines website to improve the way it handles content from web journals or blogs.  the bloglines site has become hugely popular as it gives users one place in which to read  search and share all the blogs they are interested in. ask jeeves said it was not planning to change bloglines but would use the 300 million articles it has archived to round out its index of the web. how much ask jeeves paid for bloglines was not revealed.  bloglines has become popular because it lets users build a list of the blogs they want to follow without having to visit each journal site individually. to do this it makes use of a technology known as really simple syndication (rss) that many blogs have adopted to let other sites know when new entries are made on their journals. the acquisition follows similar moves by other search sites. google acquired pyra labs  makers of the blogger software  in 2003. in 2004 msn introduced its own blog system and yahoo has tweaked its technology to do a better job of handling blog entries. jim lanzone  vice president of search properties at ask jeeves in the us  said it did not acquire bloglines just to get a foothold in the blog publishing world. he said ask jeeves was much more interested in helping people find information they were looking for rather than helping them write it.   the universe of readers is vastly larger than the universe of writers   he said. mr lanzone said the acquisition would sit well with ask s my jeeves service which lets people customise their own web experience and build up a personal collection of useful links.  search engines are about discovering information for the first time and rss is the ideal way to keep track of and monitor those sites   he said. it would also help drive information and entries from blogs to the portals that ask jeeves operates. there would be no instant sweeping changes to bloglines  said mr lanzone.  our intent is to take our time to figure out the right business model not to try to monetise it right away   he said. though mr lanzone added that ask jeeves would be helping organise the database of 300m blog entries bloglines holds with its own net indexing technology.  being able to search the blogosphere as one corpus of information will be very useful in its own right   said mr lanzone. rumours about the acquisition were broken by the napsterization weblog which said it got the hint from ask jeeves insiders.,ask jeev join web log market ask jeev bought bloglin websit improv way handl content web journal blog bloglin site becom huge popular give user one place read search share blog interest ask jeev say plan chang bloglin would use million articl archiv round index web much ask jeev paid bloglin reveal bloglin becom popular let user build list blog want follow without visit journal site individu make use technolog know realli simpl syndic r mani blog adopt let site know new entri make journal acquisit follow similar move search site googl acquir pyra lab maker blogger softwar msn introduc blog system yahoo tweak technolog well job handl blog entri jim lanzon vice presid search properti ask jeev u say acquir bloglin get foothold blog publish world say ask jeev much interest help peopl find inform look rather help write univers reader vastli large univers writer say mr lanzon say acquisit would sit well ask jeev servic let peopl customis web experi build person collect use link search engin discov inform first time r ideal way keep track monitor site say would also help drive inform entri blog portal ask jeev oper would instant sweep chang bloglin say mr lanzon intent take time figur right busi model tri monetis right away say though mr lanzon ad ask jeev would help organis databas m blog entri bloglin hold net index technolog abl search blogospher one corpu inform use right say mr lanzon rumour acquisit broken napster weblog say get hint ask jeev insid
105,1617,ferguson urges henry punishment sir alex ferguson has called on the football association to punish arsenal s thierry henry for an incident involving gabriel heinze.  ferguson believes henry deliberately caught heinze on the head with his knee during united s controversial win. the united boss said it was worse than ruud van nistelrooy s foul on ashley cole for which he got a three-game ban.  we shall present it to the fa and see what they do. the tackle on heinze was terrible   he said. clubs are permitted to ask the fa to examine specific incidents but information is expected to be provided within 48 hours of the game. the clash occurred moments before half-time when a freddie ljungberg challenge left heinze on the ground on the left touchline. henry  following the ball  attempted to hurdle the argentine but his knee collided with the back of heinze s head.  the striker protested his innocence - and referee mike riley deemed the collision accidental. ferguson was also upset by arsenal s overall discipline during the heated encounter between the two arch-rivals and praised his own side s behaviour.  edu produced a terrible tackle on scholes that was a potential leg-breaker   he said.  there were 24 fouls in the game by arsenal  seven on heinze  five on ronaldo  six by vieira - and it was only his sixth foul that got him booked. phil neville got booked for his first challenge.  i am proud of my players for the way they handled that pressure.  we have always been good at being gracious in defeat. what happened on sunday overshadowed our achievement  but then they do it all the time  don t they,ferguson urg henri punish sir alex ferguson call footbal associ punish arsen thierri henri incid involv gabriel heinz ferguson believ henri deliber caught heinz head knee unit controversi win unit bos say wors ruud van nistelrooy foul ashley cole get threegam ban shall present fa see tackl heinz terribl say club permit ask fa examin specif incid inform expect provid within hour game clash occur moment halftim freddi ljungberg challeng left heinz ground left touchlin henri follow ball attempt hurdl argentin knee collid back heinz head striker protest innoc refere mike riley deem collis accident ferguson also upset arsen overal disciplin heat encount two archriv prais side behaviour edu produc terribl tackl schole potenti legbreak say foul game arsen seven heinz five ronaldo six vieira sixth foul get book phil nevil get book first challeng proud player way handl pressur alway good graciou defeat happen sunday overshadow achiev time

107,98,ireland win eclipses refereeing  errors  the international rugby board may have to step in to stop frustrated coaches and players from publicly haranguing referees when things go belly-up.  it may have to go the whole way and have nfl-style video cameras all over the field  or slap the vociferous perpetrators over the knuckles. what the irb does not want is a football scenario where the verbal slanging matches often overshadow the game itself. sunday s explosive six nations clash at lansdowne road was a good example as ireland took another step towards their first grand slam since 1948. the game was as exciting as it comes  with a much-improved england side enraged at a few decisions that did not go their way. one can understand that frustration. there was no doubt that ireland had the rub of the green in their 19-13 victory  but the reaction from the england camp may not have endeared them to the sport s  blazers . referee jonathan kaplan was not perfect by any means and two decisions in particular made him the villain of the piece. i doubt whether kaplan would have been too pleased at the comments made. after all  he has no public recourse to criticism.  it was the same for simon mcdowell  the touch judge who was heavily criticised by scotland coach matt williams after their defeat against france. as far as england were concerned  there were queries over mark cueto s first half-effort when he went over in the corner from a charlie hodgson kick.  england coach andy robinson referred to a similar case at ravenhill in january when ulster were playing gloucester in the heineken cup. on that occasion  david humphreys kicked to tommy bowe  who touched down in the corner only for the try to be wiped out. but you cannot have cameras at every conceivable angle to pick up such anomalies. perhaps robinson was right to say the referee should have gone upstairs when josh lewsey was driven over the irish line near the end.  lewsey claims he touched it down and was in full control. however  one has to credit ireland flanker johnny o connor for cleverly scooping the ball away and blocking any evidence of a touchdown. but in rugby  everything tends to even out over the 80 minutes. the referee also missed england s danny grewcock taking out ronan o gara off the ball to allow martin corry a sunday stroll to the line. those were the stand-out moments in a classic game between the two old foes.  but there were many more  and one should not take away from those. brian o driscoll s winning try was as well-conceived as they come  while charlie hodgson s brilliant kicking display was another highlight. and ronan o gara s tremendous ability to control the game was also a crucial component. but the defining moments came with ireland under the cosh in the final 15 minutes. two outstanding pieces of defensive play denied england and allowed ireland to hold on. the first was denis hickie s brilliant double tackle in the right-hand corner. he gobbled up cueto from another hodgson cross-field kick  then regained his feet to stop lewsey from scoring a certain try. ireland s second-row colossus paul o connell was equally superb. england had turned ireland one way then the other  and the defence cordon was slowly disintegrating. england prop matt stevens ran in at full steam to suck in a few more tacklers. unfortunately he ran into o connell who hit him hard - very hard - and then wrestled the ball away for a crucial turnover. that spoke volumes about ireland s back-foot display  with defensive coach mike ford taking a bow at the end. to win a game like that showed that ireland have moved forward. it may be tries that win games  but it is defence that wins championships.,ireland win eclips refere error intern rugbi board may step stop frustrat coach player publicli harangu refere thing go bellyup may go whole way nflstyle video camera field slap vocifer perpetr knuckl irb want footbal scenario verbal slang match often overshadow game sunday explos six nation clash lansdown road good exampl ireland take anoth step toward first grand slam sinc game excit come muchimprov england side enrag decis go way one understand frustrat doubt ireland rub green victori reaction england camp may endear sport blazer refere jonathan kaplan perfect mean two decis particular make villain piec doubt whether kaplan would plea comment make public recours critic simon mcdowel touch judg heavili criticis scotland coach matt william defeat franc far england concern queri mark cueto first halfeffort go corner charli hodgson kick england coach andi robinson refer similar case ravenhil januari ulster play gloucest heineken cup occas david humphrey kick tommi bow touch corner tri wipe camera everi conceiv angl pick anomali perhap robinson right say refere go upstair josh lewsey driven irish line near end lewsey claim touch full control howev one credit ireland flanker johnni connor cleverli scoop ball away block evid touchdown rugbi everyth tend even minut refere also miss england danni grewcock take ronan gara ball allow martin corri sunday stroll line standout moment classic game two old foe mani one take away brian driscol win tri wellconceiv come charli hodgson brilliant kick display anoth highlight ronan gara tremend abil control game also crucial compon defin moment come ireland cosh final minut two outstand piec defens play deni england allow ireland hold first deni hicki brilliant doubl tackl righthand corner gobbl cueto anoth hodgson crossfield kick regain foot stop lewsey score certain tri ireland secondrow colossu paul connel equal superb england turn ireland one way defenc cordon slowli disintegr england prop matt steven ran full steam suck tackler unfortun ran connel hit hard hard wrestl ball away crucial turnov spoke volum ireland backfoot display defens coach mike ford take bow end win game like show ireland move forward may tri win game defenc win championship
108,1245,uk house prices dip in november uk house prices dipped slightly in november  the office of the deputy prime minister (odpm) has said.  the average house price fell marginally to £180 226  from £180 444 in october. recent evidence has suggested that the uk housing market is slowing after interest rate increases  and economists forecast a drop in prices during 2005. but while the monthly figures may hint at a cooling of the market  annual house price inflation is still strong  up 13.8% in the year to november. economists  however  forecast that odpm figures are likely to show a weakening in annual house price growth in coming months.  overall  the housing market activity is slowing down and that is backed up by the mortgage lending and the mortgage approvals data   said mark miller  at hbos treasury services.  the odpm data is a fairly lagging indicator.   the figures come after the bank of england said the number of mortgages approved in the uk has fallen to the lowest level for nearly a decade. the halifax  meanwhile  said last week that house prices increased by 1.1% in december - the first monthly rise since september.  the uk s biggest mortgage lender said prices rose 15.1% over the whole of 2004  but by only 2.8% in the second half of the year. it is predicting a 2% fall in overall prices in 2005 as the market stabilises after large gains in recent years. the odpm attributed the monthly fall of prices in november to a drop in the value of detached houses and flats. it said annual inflation rose between october and november because prices had fallen by 1.1% in the same period in 2003.  the odpm data showed the average house price was £192 713 in england; £139 544 in wales; £116 542 in scotland  and £111 314 in northern ireland.  all areas saw a rise in annual house price inflation in november except for northern ireland and the west midlands  where the rate was unchanged  the odpm said. the north east showed the highest rate of inflation at 26.2%  followed by yorkshire and the humber on 21.7%  and the north west on 21.1%. the east midlands  the west midlands and the south west all had an annual inflation rate of more than 15%. in london  the area with the highest average house price at £262 825  annual inflation rose only slightly in november to 7.1% from 7% the previous month.,uk hous price dip novemb uk hous price dip slightli novemb offic deputi prime minist odpm say averag hous price fell margin £ £ octob recent evid suggest uk hous market slow interest rate increas economist forecast drop price monthli figur may hint cool market annual hous price inflat still strong year novemb economist howev forecast odpm figur like show weaken annual hous price growth come month overal hous market activ slow back mortgag lend mortgag approv data say mark miller hbo treasuri servic odpm data fairli lag indic figur come bank england say number mortgag approv uk fall low level nearli decad halifax meanwhil say last week hous price increas decemb first monthli rise sinc septemb uk big mortgag lender say price rise whole second half year predict fall overal price market stabilis larg gain recent year odpm attribut monthli fall price novemb drop valu detach hous flat say annual inflat rise octob novemb price fall period odpm data show averag hous price £ england £ wale £ scotland £ northern ireland area saw rise annual hous price inflat novemb except northern ireland west midland rate unchang odpm say north east show high rate inflat follow yorkshir humber north west east midland west midland south west annual inflat rate london area high averag hous price £ annual inflat rise slightli novemb previou month
109,1860,camera phones are  must-haves  four times more mobiles with cameras in them will be sold in europe by the end of 2004 than last year  says a report from analysts gartner.  globally  the number sold will reach 159 million  an increase of 104%. the report predicts that nearly 70% of all mobile phones sold will have a built-in camera by 2008. improving imaging technology in mobiles is making them an increasingly  must-have  buy. in europe  cameras on mobiles can take 1.3 megapixel images. but in japan and asia pacific  where camera phone technology is much more advanced  mobiles have already been released which can take 3.2 megapixel images. japan still dominates mobile phone technology  and the uptake there is huge. by 2008  according to gartner  95% of all mobiles sold there will have cameras on them.  camera phones had some teething problems when they were first launched as people struggled with poor quality images and uses for them  as well as the complexity and expense of sending them via mms (multimedia messaging services). this has changed in the last 18 months. handset makers have concentrated on trying to make phones easier to use. realising that people like to use their camera phones in different ways  they have introduced more design features  like rotating screens and viewfinders  removable memory cards and easier controls to send picture messages.  mobile companies have introduced more ways for people to share photos with other people. these have included giving people easier ways to publish them on websites  or mobile blogs - moblogs. but the report suggests that until image quality increases more  people will not be interested in printing out pictures at kiosks. image sensor technology inside cameras phones is improving. the gartner report suggests that by mid-2005  it is likely that the image resolution of most camera phones will be more than two megapixels. consumer digital cameras images range from two to four megapixels in quality  and up to six megapixels on a high-end camera. but a lot of work is being done to make camera phones more like digital cameras. some handsets already feature limited zoom capability  and manufacturers are looking into technological improvements that will let people take more photos in poorly-lit conditions  like nightclubs. other developments include wide-angle modes  basic editing features  and better sensors and processors for recording film clips.  images from camera phones have even made it into the art world. an exhibition next month in aid of the charity mencap  will feature snaps taken from the camera phones of top artists.  the exhibition  fonetography  will feature images taken by photographers david bailey  rankin and nan goldin  and artists sir peter blake  tracey emin and jack vettriano. but some uses for them have worried many organisations. intel  samsung  the uk s foreign office and lawrence livermore national laboratories in the us  have decided to ban camera phones from their buildings for fear of sensitive information being snapped and leaked. many schools  fitness centres and local councils have also banned them over fears about privacy and misuse. italy s information commissioner has also voiced concern and has issued guidelines on where and how the phones can be used. but camera phone fears have not dampened the manufacturers  profits. according to recent figures  sony ericsson s profits tripled in the third-quarter because of new camera phones. over 60% of mobiles sold during the three months through to september featured integrated cameras  it said.,camera phone musthav four time mobil camera sell europ end last year say report analyst gartner global number sell reach million increas report predict nearli mobil phone sell builtin camera improv imag technolog mobil make increasingli musthav buy europ camera mobil take megapixel imag japan asia pacif camera phone technolog much advanc mobil alreadi releas take megapixel imag japan still domin mobil phone technolog uptak huge accord gartner mobil sell camera camera phone teeth problem first launch peopl struggl poor qualiti imag use well complex expens send via mm multimedia messag servic chang last month handset maker concentr tri make phone easy use realis peopl like use camera phone differ way introduc design featur like rotat screen viewfind remov memori card easy control send pictur messag mobil compani introduc way peopl share photo peopl includ give peopl easy way publish websit mobil blog moblog report suggest imag qualiti increas peopl interest print pictur kiosk imag sensor technolog insid camera phone improv gartner report suggest mid like imag resolut camera phone two megapixel consum digit camera imag rang two four megapixel qualiti six megapixel highend camera lot work do make camera phone like digit camera handset alreadi featur limit zoom capabl manufactur look technolog improv let peopl take photo poorlylit condit like nightclub develop includ wideangl mode basic edit featur well sensor processor record film clip imag camera phone even make art world exhibit next month aid chariti mencap featur snap take camera phone top artist exhibit fonetographi featur imag take photograph david bailey rankin nan goldin artist sir peter blake tracey emin jack vettriano use worri mani organis intel samsung uk foreign offic lawrenc livermor nation laboratori u decid ban camera phone build fear sensit inform snap leak mani school fit centr local council also ban fear privaci misus itali inform commission also voic concern issu guidelin phone use camera phone fear dampen manufactur profit accord recent figur soni ericsson profit tripl thirdquart new camera phone mobil sell three month septemb featur integr camera say
110,182,blogger grounded by her airline a us airline attendant is fighting for her job after she was suspended over postings on her blog  or online diary.  queen of the sky  otherwise known as ellen simonetti  evolved into an anonymous semi-fictional account of life in the sky. but after she posted pictures of herself in uniform  delta airlines suspended her indefinitely without pay. ms simonetti was told her suspension was a result of  inappropriate  images. delta airlines declined to comment.   i was really shocked  i had no warning   ms simonetti told bbc news online.  i never thought i would get in trouble because of the blog. i thought if they had a problem  someone would have said something before taking action.  the issue has highlighted concerns amongst the growing blogging community about conflicts of interest  employment law and free speech on personal websites. ms simonetti was suspended on 25 september pending an investigation and has since lodged a complaint with the us equal employment opportunity commission (eeoc). a spokesperson for delta airlines told bbc news online:  all i can tell you is we do not discuss internal employee issues with the media.  she added she could not say whether a similar situation over personal websites had occurred in the past.  ms simonetti started her personal blog in january to help her get over her mother s death. she had ensured she made no mention of which airline she worked for  and created fictional names for cities and companies. the airline s name was changed to anonymous airline and the city in which she was based was called quirksville. a large part of the blog contained fictional stories because queen of the sky developed over the months as a character in her own right  according to ms simonetti.  the images were taken from a digital camera she had inherited from her mother.  we often take pictures on flight or on layovers. i just though why not include them on my blog for fun.  i never meant it as something to harm my company and don t understand how they think it did harm them   ms simonetti said. she has also claimed that pictures of male delta airline employees in uniform are freely available on the web. of the 10 or so images on the site  only one showed ms simonetti s flight  wings .  they did not tell me which pictures they had a problem with. i am just assuming it was the one of me posing on seats where my skirt rode up   she said. the images were removed as soon as she learned she had been suspended. as far as ms simonetti knows  there is no company anti-blogging policy. there is guidance which suggests the company uniform cannot be used without approval from management  but use in personal pictures on websites is unclear.  jeffrey matsuura  director of the law and technology programme at the university of dayton  said personal websites can be hazardous for both employers and their employees.  there are many examples of employees who have presented some kind of material online that have gotten them in trouble with employers   he said. it was crucial that any policy about what was and what was not acceptable was expressed clearly  was reasonable  and enforced fairly in company policy.  you have to remember that as an employee  you don t have total free speech anymore   he said. mr matsuura added that some companies actively encouraged employees to blog.  one of the areas where it does become a problem is that they encourage this when it suits them  but they may not be particularly clear when they [employees] do cross the line.  he speculated that delta might be concerned that the fictional content on the blog may be linked back to the airline after the images of ms simonetti in uniform were posted.  whether or not that is successful will depend on what exactly is prohibited  and whether you can reasonably say this content now crosses that line   he said. ms simonetti said her suspension has caused two of her friends to discontinue their blogs. one of them was asked to stop blogging by his company before any action was taken.  if they had asked me just take down the blog  i would have done it  but that was not been given to me as an option   she said.  this blogging thing is obviously a new problem for employers and they need to get a policy about it. if i had known it would cost me my job  i would not have done that.,blogger ground airlin u airlin attend fight job suspend post blog onlin diari queen sky otherwis know ellen simonetti evolv anonym semifict account life sky post pictur uniform delta airlin

111,1243,mystery surrounds new yukos owner the fate of russia s yuganskneftegas - the oil firm sold to a little-known buyer on sunday - is the subject of frantic speculation in moscow.  baikal finance group emerged as the auction winner  agreeing to pay 260.75bn roubles (£4.8bn; $9.4bn). russia s newspapers claimed that baikal was a front for gas monopoly gazprom  which had been expected to win. the sale has destroyed yukos  once the owner of yuganskneftegas  said founder mikhail khodorkovsky.  yuganskneftegas has been sold in the best traditions of the 90s. the authorities have made themselves a wonderful christmas present - russia s most efficient oil company has been destroyed   the interfax news agency quoted mr khodorkovsky as saying via his lawyers.  gazprom had been expected to win the auction but is thought to have failed to get finance for the deal after a us court injunction barred it from taking part. last week  yukos filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the us in a last-ditch attempt to hang on to yuganskneftegas  which accounts for 60% of its output. a us judge banned gazprom from taking part in the auction and barred international banks from providing the firm with cash.  they screwed up the financing   said ronald smith  an analyst at renaissance capital in moscow.  and gazprom doesn t have this sort of money lying around.   gazprom has denied that it is behind the purchase.  it is a front for somebody but not necessarily for gazprom   said oleg maximov  an analyst at troika dialog in moscow.  we don t know if this company is linked 100% to gazprom.   we tried to find it  but we couldn t and as far as i know  the papers had the same result.  the sale has however bought time for gazprom to raise the money needed for the purchase  analysts said. one scenario is that baikal will not pay when it is supposed to in two weeks time  putting yuganskneftegas back in the hands of bailiffs and back within the reach of gazprom. yukos is not planning on letting go of its unit without a fight and has threatened legal action against any buyer. menatep  yukos main shareholders  group  has also threatened legal action. yukos claims that it is being punished for the political ambitions of its founder  mikhail khodorkovsky  who is now in jail facing separate fraud charges. it has been hit with more than $27bn in taxes and fines and many observers now say that the break up of the firm that accounts for 20% of russia s oil output is inevitable.,mysteri surround new yuko owner fate russia yuganskneftega oil firm sell littleknown buyer sunday subject frantic specul moscow baikal financ group emerg auction winner agre pay bn roubl £bn bn russia newspap claim baikal front ga monopoli gazprom expect win sale destroy yuko owner yuganskneftega say founder mikhail khodorkovski yuganskneftega sell best tradit s author make wonder christma present russia effici oil compani destroy interfax news agenc quot mr khodorkovski say via lawyer gazprom expect win auction thought fail get financ deal u court injunct bar take part last week yuko file chapter bankruptci protect u lastditch attempt hang yuganskneftega account output u judg ban gazprom take part auction bar intern bank provid firm cash screw financ say ronald smith analyst renaiss capit moscow gazprom sort money lie around gazprom deni behind purchas front somebodi necessarili gazprom say oleg maximov analyst troika dialog moscow know compani link gazprom tri find far know paper result sale howev bought time gazprom rais money need purchas analyst say one scenario baikal pay suppos two week time put yuganskneftega back hand bailiff back within reach gazprom yuko plan let go unit without fight threaten legal action buyer menatep yuko main sharehold group also threaten legal action yuko claim punish polit ambit founder mikhail khodorkovski jail face separ fraud charg hit bn tax fine mani observ say break firm account russia oil output inevit
112,2112,warning over windows word files writing a microsoft word document can be a dangerous business  according to document security firm workshare.  up to 75% of all business documents contained sensitive information most firms would not want exposed  a survey by the firm revealed. to make matters worse 90% of those companies questioned had no idea that confidential information was leaking. the report warns firms to do a better job of policing documents as corporate compliance becomes more binding.  sensitive information inadvertently leaked in documents includes confidential contractual terms  competitive information that rivals would be keen to see and special deals for key customers  said andrew pearson  european boss of workshare which commissioned the research.  the efficiencies the internet has brought in such as instant access to information have also created security and control issues too   he said. the problem is particularly acute with documents prepared using microsoft word because of the way it maintains hidden records about editing changes. as documents get passed around  worked on and amended by different staff members the sensitive information finds its way into documents. poor control over the editing and amending process can mean that information that should be expunged survives final edits. microsoft  however  does provide an add-on tool for windows pcs that fixes the problem.  the remove hidden data add-in is a tool that you can use to remove personal or hidden data that might not be immediately apparent when you view the document in your microsoft office application   says the instructions on microsoft s website. microsoft recommends that the tool is used before people publish any word document. a tool for apple machines running word is not available. workshare surveyed firms around the world and found that  on average  31% of documents contained legally sensitive information but in many firms up to three-quarters fell in to the high risk category. often  said mr pearson  this sensitive information was invisible because it got deleted and changed as different drafts were prepared.  however  the way that windows works means that earlier versions can be recalled and reconstructed by those keen to see how a document has evolved. few firms have any knowledge of the existence of this so-called metadata about the changes that a document has gone through or that it can be reconstructed. the discovery of this hidden information could prove embarrassing for companies if  for instance  those tendering for contracts found out about the changes to terms of a deal being negotiated. the research revealed that a document s metadata could be substantial as  on average  only 40% of contributors  changes to a document make it to the final draft. problems with documents could mean trouble for firms as regulatory bodies step up scrutiny and compliance laws start to bite  said mr pearson.,warn window word file write microsoft word document danger busi accord document secur firm workshar busi document contain sensit inform firm would want expo survey firm reveal make matter wors compani question idea confidenti inform leak report warn firm well job polic document corpor complianc becom bind sensit inform inadvert leak document includ confidenti contractu term competit inform rival would keen see special deal key custom say andrew pearson european bos workshar commiss research effici internet brought instant access inform also creat secur control issu say problem particularli acut document prepar use microsoft word way maintain hidden record edit chang document get pas around work amend differ staff member sensit inform find way document poor control edit amend process mean inform expung surviv final edit microsoft howev provid addon tool window pc fix problem remov hidden data addin tool use remov person hidden data might immedi appar view document microsoft offic applic say instruct microsoft websit microsoft recommend tool use peopl publish word document tool appl machin run word avail workshar survey firm around world found averag document contain legal sensit inform mani firm threequart fell high risk categori often say mr pearson sensit inform invis get delet chang differ draft prepar howev way window work mean earlier version recal reconstruct keen see document evolv firm knowledg exist socal metadata chang document go reconstruct discoveri hidden inform could prove embarrass compani instanc tender contract found chang term deal negoti research reveal document metadata could substanti averag contributor chang document make final draft problem document could mean troubl firm regulatori bodi step scrutini complianc law start bite say mr pearson

114,1269,remote control rifle range debuts soon you could go hunting via the net.  a texas company is considering letting web users use a remote-controlled rifle to shoot down deer  antelope and wild pigs. for a small fee users will take control of a camera and rifle that they can use to spot and shoot the game animals as they roam around a 133-hectare texas ranch. the live-shot website behind the scheme already lets people practise shooting at targets via the internet.  john underwood  the man behind the live-shot website  said the idea for the remote-control hunting came to him a year ago when he was watching deer via a webcam on another net site.  we were looking at a beautiful white-tail buck and my friend said  if you just had a gun for that . a little light bulb went off in my head   mr underwood told the reuters news agency. a year s work and $10 000 has resulted in a remote-controlled rig on which sits a camera and .22 calibre rifle. mr underwood is planning to put one of these rigs in a concealed location in a small reserve on his texas ranch and let people shoot at a variety of game animals. also needed is a fast net connection so remote hunters can quickly track and aim at passing game animals with the camera and rifle rig. each remote hunting session will cost $150 with additional fees for meat processing and taxidermy work. species that can be shot will include barbary  corsican and mouflon sheep  blackbuck antelope and wild pigs. already the live-shot site lets people shoot 10 rounds at paper and silhouette targets for $5.95 for each 20-minute shooting session. for further fees  users can get the target they shot and a dvd recording of their session. handlers oversee each shooting session and can stop the gun being fired if it is being aimed off-range or at something it should not be. mr underwood said that internet hunting could be popular with disabled hunters unable to get out in the woods or distant hunters who cannot afford a trip to texas. in a statement the rspca said it had  grave concerns  about people being allowed to go online and remotely control a rifle.  we assume it would be extremely difficult to accurately control a gun in this way and therefore it would be difficult to ensure a  clean kill   something the rspca accepts is the intention of those shooting for sport   it said.  animals hit but not killed would without doubt be caused to suffer unnecessarily   said the statement. mike berger  wildlife director of the texas parks and wildlife department  said current hunting statutes did not cover net or remote hunting. he said state laws on hunting only covered  regulated animals  such as native deer and bird species. as such there was nothing to stop mr underwood letting people hunt  unregulated  imported animals and wild pigs. mr underwood also lets people come in person to the ranch to hunt and shoot game animals.,remot control rifl rang debut soon could go hunt via net texa compani consid let web user use remotecontrol rifl shoot deer antelop wild pig small fee user take control camera rifl use spot shoot game anim roam around hectar texa ranch liveshot websit behind scheme alreadi let peopl practis shoot target via internet john underwood man behind liveshot websit say idea remotecontrol hunt come year ago watch deer via webcam anoth net site look beauti whitetail buck friend say gun littl light bulb go head mr underwood told reuter news agenc year work result remotecontrol rig sit camera calibr rifl mr underwood plan put one rig conceal locat small reserv texa ranch let peopl shoot varieti game anim also need fast net connect remot hunter quickli track aim pas game anim camera rifl rig remot hunt session cost addit fee meat process taxidermi work speci shot includ barbari corsican mouflon sheep blackbuck antelop wild pig alreadi liveshot site let peopl shoot round paper silhouett target minut shoot session fee user get target shot dvd record session handler overse shoot session stop gun fire aim offrang someth mr underwood say internet hunt could popular disabl hunter unabl get wood distant hunter afford trip texa statement rspca say grave concern peopl allow go onlin remot control rifl assum would extrem difficult accur control gun way therefor would difficult ensur clean kill someth rspca accept intent shoot sport say anim hit kill would without doubt caus suffer unnecessarili say statement mike berger wildlif director texa park wildlif depart say current hunt statut cover net remot hunt say state law hunt cover regul anim nativ deer bird speci noth stop mr underwood let peopl hunt unregul import anim wild pig mr underwood also let peopl come person ranch hunt shoot game anim

and was likely to worsen the finances of troubled delta  parent of comair. comair  deeply regrets the inconvenience to all of our customers caused by the severe winter storm in the ohio river valley during the busy holiday season  exacerbated by problems with the airline s crew scheduling system  causing additional flight delays and cancellations   the delta subsidiary said in a statement.,u probe airlin travel chao u govern investig two airlin u airway delta air line comair subsidiari travel chao christma weekend staff call sick u airway comput failur comair left passeng strand piec baggag undeliv u airway chapter bankruptci protect second time two year battl cut cost current tri negoti pay cut flight baggag staff transport secretari norman mineta say deepli concern disrupt passeng order thorough investig comair comput breakdown plung flightcrew schedul system disarray altogeth flight cancel holiday long weekend mr mineta say import understand happen happen whether carrier properli plan holiday travel period respond appropri consum need aftermath ad atmospher chao mountain luggag left pile third u airway baggag handl staff call sick also shortag u airway flight attend nearli fifth say sick work lead mani flight cancel howev union offici deni deliber sickout say mani peopl flu time year airlin chronic understaf u airway end cancel flight christma day strand passeng mani airport ground crew u airway seventhlargest u airlin chapter bankruptci protect face courtimpos pay cut next month airlin need negoti paycut find rout bankruptci look paycut total m u airway fullscal employe mutini hand comment michael boyd industri consult disrupt flight schedul could discourag custom fli u airway reduc revenu u airway cancel approxim flight thursday friday saturday sunday monday say industri offici airlin say embarrass situat deepli regret inconveni caus custom probe focu industri complianc agreement aim improv qualiti passeng servic far allow airlin avoid congressionallymand standard analyst say christma chao cast doubt u airway abil emerg bankruptci like worsen financ troubl delta parent comair comair deepli regret inconveni custom caus sever winter storm ohio river valley busi holiday season exacerb problem airlin crew schedul system caus addit flight delay cancel delta subsidiari say statement

120,575,blair says uk tsunami aid to soar tony blair has predicted the british government will eventually give  hundreds of millions  of pounds in aid to countries hit by the tsunami.  the prime minister was speaking publicly for the first time since returning from his holiday in egypt. mr blair insisted he had been  intimately involved  in  all decisions at all times  despite being abroad. he was speaking before the uk joins a three-minute silence at noon across the eu for the estimated 150 000 dead.  the foreign office says 41 britons are now confirmed to have died in the tsunami which struck south asia on boxing day  with 158 others missing. asked about criticism that he did not cut short his holiday  mr blair told bbc radio 4 s today programme:  i don t think this is a situation in which the british people need me to articulate what they feel.   i think they feel - as we all do - shock  horror  and absolute solidarity with those people who have lost their lives.  the important thing was action and not words  he said  adding that of the £50m given by the government so far only  six or seven million  had been spent. it would become easier in the coming weeks to assess just how much money would have to be put in.  my estimate is we will need to spend from government several hundred million pounds. so we will far and away more than match the generosity of the british people   he said. asked whether he had not returned to work immediately because he was under doctors orders to rest  mr blair said there was also a story he had been away for plastic surgery.  as you can see unfortunately i am still looking the same as i always did   he joked.  the prime minister took personal charge of the uk s response on tuesday  chairing a meeting of the emergency committee of ministers that has convened daily since boxing day. he also spoke on the telephone to us president george bush  and the presidents of sri lanka and indonesia. chancellor gordon brown earlier backed a plan to freeze the foreign debts of all the affected nations.  mr brown  who was not at the downing street meeting  says he has been in  intensive talks  with other g8 finance ministers. germany proposed a freeze last week and canada has begun its own moratorium. the chancellor said the plan would initially save the most affected countries about $3bn (£1.58bn) in repayments. tory leader michael howard also backed the proposals but said ministers had been  playing catch-up  with public donations.  foreign secretary jack straw is to visit thailand and indonesia this week. during his trip  mr straw will represent the g8 at the international conference called in jakarta  indonesia on thursday. on friday  he will visit the thai beach resort of phuket  where british families are still searching for relatives.  international development secretary hilary benn will also visit aceh in indonesia  as well as sri lanka. the british public has now pledged £76m in aid with emergency supplies from the british government starting to arrive in the region on three raf flights in a joint operation with scandinavian countries. two ships - the royal fleet auxiliary ship diligence and frigate hms chatham - have arrived in the disaster area. a second royal fleet auxiliary vessel  the bayleaf  is also being sent. uk charities have also begun chartering planes to deliver aid.    -

122,173,australia rates at four year high australia is raising its benchmark interest rate to its highest level in four years despite signs of a slowdown in the country s economy.  the reserve bank of australia lifted interest rates 0.25% to 5.5%  their first upwards move in more than a year. however  shortly after the bank made its decision  new figures showed a fall in economic growth in the last quarter. the bank said it had acted to curb inflation but the move was criticised by some analysts.  the rate hike was the first since december 2003 and had been well-flagged in advance. however  opposition parties and some analysts said the move was ill-timed given data showing the australian economy grew just 0.1% between october and december and 1.5% on an annual basis.  the figures  representing a decline from the 0.2% growth in gdp seen between july and september  were below market expectations. consumer spending remains strong  however  and the bank is concerned about growing inflationary pressures.  over recent months it has become increasingly clear that remaining spare capacity in the labour and goods markets is becoming rather limited   said ian macfarlane  governor of the reserve bank.  at 2.6%  inflation remains within the bank s 2-3% target range. however  exports declined in the second half of 2004  fuelling a rise in the country s current account deficit - the difference in the value of imports compared to exports - to a record australian dollar 29.4bn. the australian government said the economy remained strong with unemployment at a near 30 year low.  the economy has been strong and it is properly moderating but it doesn t look to me like it s slowing in any unreasonable way   said treasurer peter costello. stock markets had factored in the likelihood of a rate rise but analysts still expressed concern about the strength of the economy.  that 1.5% annual growth rate is the lowest we have seen since the post-election slump we saw back in 2000-1   said michael blythe  chief economist at the commonwealth bank of australia.  this suggests the economy really did slow very sharply in the second half of 2004.,australia rate four year high australia rais benchmark interest rate high level four year despit sign slowdown countri economi reserv bank australia lift interest rate first upward move year howev shortli bank make decis new figur show fall econom growth last quarter bank say act curb inflat move criticis analyst rate hike first sinc decemb wellflag advanc howev opposit parti analyst say move illtim give data show australian economi grow octob decemb annual basi figur repres declin growth gdp see juli septemb market expect consum spend remain strong howev bank concern grow inflationari pressur recent month becom increasingli clear remain spare capac labour good market becom rather limit say ian macfarlan governor reserv bank inflat remain within bank target rang howev export declin second half fuell rise countri current account deficit differ valu import compar export record australian dollar bn australian govern say economi remain strong unemploy near year low economi strong properli moder look like slow unreason way say treasur peter costello stock market factor likelihood rate rise analyst still express concern strength economi annual growth rate low see sinc postelect slump saw back say michael blyth chief economist commonwealth bank australia suggest economi realli slow sharpli second half
123,1661,debate needed  on donations cap a cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet  the elections watchdog has said.  fears that big donors can buy political favours have sparked calls for a limit. in a new report  the electoral commission says it is worth debating a £10 000 cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it. it also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning.  there were almost £68m in reported donations to political parties in 2001  2002 and 2003  with nearly £12m of them from individual gifts worth more than £1m. the rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions. the commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash - something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work.  while we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap  we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible   says its report. if there was to be a cap  it should be £10 000 - a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned £56m in donations between 2001 and 2003.  even without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small-scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under £200. it also suggests increasing state funding for parties to £3m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the house of commons  european parliament  scottish parliament  welsh assembly or northern ireland assembly. and it suggests new ways of boosting election campaigning  seen as a way of improving voter turnout. all local election candidates should be entitled to a free mailshot for campaign leaflets  says the watchdog. and there should be a shift in the amount of money allowed to be spent at elections from a national level to a local level to help politicians engage better with voters.  the report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates  while cutting national spending limits from £20m to £15m. the commission also says the spending limits for general elections should cover the four months before the poll - as happens with other elections. electoral commission chairman sam younger said:  there is no doubt that political parties have a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy and for this they need to be adequately resourced.  our research has shown that people want to be more informed about party politics and that they want politicians to be more visible and accessible.  the public are reluctant for the state to fund parties but at the same time are unhappy with large private donations.  he called for a wider public debate on party funding to find the consensus needed for radical changes to the current system.,debat need donat cap cap donat polit parti introduc yet elect watchdog say fear big donor buy polit favour spark call limit new report elector commiss say worth debat £ cap futur right time introduc also say state fund polit parti candid abl spend elect campaign almost £m report donat polit parti nearli £m individu gift worth £m rule alreadi chang public see give much parti report say still public suspicion commiss say cap donat would mean taxpay give parti cash someth would first accept public show work principl oppos introduct donat cap believ major departur exist system would sensibl say report cap £ small enough amount make differ would ban £m donat even without chang commiss urg polit parti seek smallscal donat suggest incom tax relief gift £ also suggest increas state fund parti £m help extend parti least two member hous common european parliament scottish parliament welsh assembl northern ireland assembl suggest new way boost elect campaign see way improv voter turnout local elect candid entitl free mailshot campaign leaflet say watchdog shift amount money allow spent elect nation level local level help politician engag well voter report suggest doubl money spent candid cut nation spend limit £m £m commiss also say spend limit gener elect cover four month poll happen elect elector commiss chairman sam young say doubt polit parti vital role play maintain health democraci need adequ resourc research show peopl want inform parti polit want politician visibl access public reluct state fund parti time unhappi larg privat donat call wider public debat parti fund find consensu need radic chang current system

125,1211,us adds more jobs than expected the us economy added 337 000 jobs in october - a seven-month high and far more than wall street expectations.  in a welcome economic boost for newly re-elected president george w bush  the labor department figures come after a slow summer of weak jobs gains. jobs were created in every sector of the us economy except manufacturing. while the separate unemployment rate went up to 5.5% from 5.4% in september  this was because more people were now actively seeking work.  the 337 000 new jobs added to us payrolls in october was twice the 169 000 figure that wall street economists had forecast. in addition  the labor department revised up the number of jobs created in the two previous months - to 139 000 in september instead of 96 000  and to 198 000 in august instead of 128 000. the better than expected jobs data had an immediate upward effect on stocks in new york  with the main dow jones index gaining 45.4 points to 10 360 by late morning trading.  it looks like the job situation is improving and that this will support consumer spending going into the holidays  and offset some of the drag caused by high oil prices this year   said economist gary thayer of ag edwards & sons.  other analysts said the upbeat jobs data made it more likely that the us federal reserve would increase interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 2% when it meets next week.  it should empower the fed to clearly do something   said robert macintosh  chief economist with eaton vance management in boston. kathleen utgoff  commissioner of the bureau of labor  said many of the 71 000 new construction jobs added in october were involved in rebuilding and clean-up work in florida  and neighbouring deep south states  following four hurricanes in august and september. the dollar rose temporarily on the job creation news before falling back to a new record low against the euro  as investors returned their attention to other economic factors  such as the us s record trade deficit. there is also speculation that president bush will deliberately try to keep the dollar low in order to assist a growth in exports.,u add job expect u economi ad job octob sevenmonth high far wall street expect welcom econom boost newli reelect presid georg w bush labor depart figur come slow summer weak job gain job creat everi sector u economi except manufactur separ unemploy rate go septemb peopl activ seek work new job ad u payrol octob twice figur wall street economist forecast addit labor depart revis number job creat two previou month septemb instead august instead well expect job data immedi upward effect stock new york main dow jone index gain point late morn trade look like job situat improv support consum spend go holiday offset drag caus high oil price year say economist gari thayer ag edward son analyst say upbeat job data make like u feder reserv would increas interest rate quarter percentag point meet next week empow fed clearli someth say robert macintosh chief economist eaton vanc manag boston kathleen utgoff commission bureau labor say mani new construct job ad octob involv rebuild cleanup work florida neighbour deep south state follow four hurrican august septemb dollar rise temporarili job creation news fall back new record low euro investor return attent econom factor u record trade deficit also specul presid bush deliber tri keep dollar low order assist growth export
126,1439,microsoft debuts security tools microsoft is releasing tools that clean up pcs harbouring viruses and spyware.  the virus-fighting program will be updated monthly and is a precursor to microsoft releasing dedicated anti-virus software. also being released is a software utility that will help users find and remove any spyware on their home computer. although initially free it is thought that soon microsoft will be charging users for the anti-spyware tool.  the anti-spyware tool is available now and the anti-virus utility is expected to be available later this month. microsoft s windows operating system has long been a favourite of people who write computer viruses because it is so ubiquitous and has many loopholes that can be exploited. it has proved such a tempting target that there are now thought to be more than 100 000 viruses and other malicious programs in existence. latest research suggests that new variants of viruses are being cranked out at a rate of up to 200 per week. spyware is surreptitious software that sneaks on to home computers  often without users  knowledge. in its most benign form it just bombards users with pop-up adverts or hijacks web browser settings. the most malicious forms steal confidential information or log every keystroke that users make. surveys have shown that most pcs are infested with spyware. research by technology firms earthlink and webroot revealed that 90% of windows machine have the malicious software on board and  on average  each one harbours 28 separate spyware programs. before now microsoft has left the market for pc security software to specialist firms such as symantec  mcafee  trend micro and many others. it said that its virus cleaning program would not stop machines being infected nor remove the need for other anti-virus programs. on spyware freely available programs such as ad-aware and spybot have become widely used by people keen to keep the latest variants at bay. microsoft s two security tools have emerged as a result of acquisitions the company has made over the last two years. in 2003 it bought romanian firm gecad software to get hold of its anti-virus technology. in december 2004 it bought new york-based anti-spyware firm giant company software. last year microsoft also released the sp2 upgrade for windows xp that closed many security loopholes in the software and made it easier for people to manage their anti-virus and firewall programs.,microsoft debut secur tool microsoft releas tool clean pc harbour virus spywar virusfight program updat monthli precursor microsoft releas dedic antiviru softwar also releas softwar util help user find remov spywar home comput although initi free thought soon microsoft charg user antispywar tool antispywar tool avail antiviru util expect avail later month microsoft window oper system long favourit peopl write comput virus ubiquit mani loophol exploit prove tempt target thought virus malici program exist late research suggest new variant virus crank rate per week spywar surreptiti softwar sneak home comput often without user knowledg benign form bombard user popup advert hijack web browser set malici form steal confidenti inform log everi keystrok user make survey show pc infest spywar research technolog firm earthlink webroot reveal window machin malici softwar board averag one harbour separ spywar program microsoft left market pc secur softwar specialist firm symantec mcafe trend micro mani other say viru clean program would stop machin infect remov need antiviru program spywar freeli avail program adawar spybot becom wide use peopl keen keep late variant bay microsoft two secur tool emerg result acquisit compani make last two year bought romanian firm gecad softwar get hold antiviru technolog decemb bought new yorkbas antispywar firm giant compani softwar last year microsoft also releas sp upgrad window xp close mani secur loophol softwar make easy peopl manag antiviru firewal program
127,2150,wi-fi web reaches farmers in peru a network of community computer centres  linked by wireless technology  is providing a helping hand for poor farmers in peru.  the pilot scheme in the huaral valley  80 kilometres north of the capital lima  aims to offer the 6 000-strong community up-to-date information on agricultural market prices and trends. the agricultural information project for farmers of the chancay-huaral valley also provides vital links between local organisations in charge of water irrigation  enabling them to coordinate their actions. more than 13 000 rural inhabitants  as well as 18 000 students in the region  will also benefit from the telecoms infrastructure.  the 14 telecentres uses only free open source software and affordable computer equipment. the network has been three years in the making and was officially inaugurated in september.  the non-government organisation  cepes (peruvian centre for social studies) led the $200 000 project  also backed by local institutions  the education and agriculture ministries  and european development organisations.  the plan includes training on computers and internet skills for both operators and users of the system   said carlos saldarriaga  technical coordinator at cepes. farmers are also taking extra lessons on how to apply the new information to make the most of their plots of land. the board of irrigation users which runs the computer centres  aims to make the network self-sustainable within three years  through the cash generated by using the telecentres as internet cafes.  one of the key elements of the project is the agricultural information system  with its flagship huaral.org website. there  farmers can find the prices for local produce  as well as information on topics ranging from plague prevention to the latest farming techniques. the system also helps the inhabitants of the chancay-huaral valley to organise their vital irrigation systems.  water is the main element that unites them all. it is a precious element in peru s coastal areas  because it is so scarce  and therefore it is necessary to have proper irrigation systems to make the most of it   mr saldarriaga told the bbc news website. the information network also allows farmers to look beyond their own region  and share experiences with other colleagues from the rest of peru and even around the world.  cepes says the involvement of the farmers has been key in the project s success.  throughout the last three years  the people have provided a vital thrust to the project; they feel it belongs to them   said mr saldarriaga. the community training sessions  attended by an equal number of men and women  have been the perfect showcase for their enthusiasm.  we have had an excellent response  mainly from young people. but we have also had a great feedback when we trained 40 or 50-year old women  who were seeing a computer for the first time in their lives.  so far  the huaral programme promoters say the experience has been very positive  and are already planning on spreading the model among other farmers  organisations in peru.  this is a pilot project  and we have been very keen on its cloning potential in other places   underlined mr saldarriaga.  the cepes researcher recalls what happened in cuyo  a 50-family community with no electricity  during the construction of the local telecentre site. there it was necessary to build a mini-hydraulic dam in order to generate 2kw worth of power for the computers  the communications equipment and the cabin lights.  it was already dark when the technicians realised they didn t have any light bulbs to test the generator  so they turned up to the local store to buy light bulbs   recalls carlos saldarriaga.  the logical answer was  we don t sell any   so they had to wait until the next morning to do the testing.  now  with the wireless network  cuyo as well as the other communities is no longer isolated.,wifi web reach farmer peru network commun comput centr link wireless technolog provid help hand poor farmer peru pilot scheme huaral valley kilometr north capit lima aim offer strong commun uptod inform agricultur market price trend agricultur inform project farmer chancayhuar valley also provid vital link local organis charg water irrig enabl coordin action rural inhabit well student region also benefit telecom infrastructur telecentr use free open sourc softwar afford comput equip network three year make offici inaugur septemb nongovern organis cepe peruvian centr social studi lead project also back local institut educ agricultur ministri european develop organis plan includ train comput internet skill oper user system say carlo saldarriaga technic coordin cepe farmer also take extra lesson appli new inform make plot land board irrig user run comput centr aim make network selfsustain within three year cash gener use telecentr internet cafe one key element project agricultur inform system flagship huaralorg websit farmer find price local produc well inform topic rang plagu prevent late farm techniqu system also help inhabit chancayhuar valley organis vital irrig system water main element unit preciou element peru coastal area scarc therefor necessari proper irrig system make mr saldarriaga told bbc news websit inform network also allow farmer look beyond region share experi colleagu rest peru even around world cepe say involv farmer key project success throughout last three year peopl provid vital thrust project feel belong say mr saldarriaga commun train session attend equal number men woman perfect showcas enthusiasm excel respons mainli young peopl also great feedback train year old woman see comput first time live far huaral programm promot say experi posit alreadi plan spread model among farmer organis peru pilot project keen clone potenti place underlin mr saldarriaga cepe research recal happen cuyo famili commun electr construct local telecentr site necessari build minihydraul dam order gener kw worth power comput commun equip cabin light alreadi dark technician realis light bulb test gener turn local store buy light bulb recal carlo saldarriaga logic answer sell wait next morn test wireless network cuyo well commun longer isol
128,284,plan to give elderly care control elderly and disabled people would choose how their own budget for personal care was spent and organised under government plans.  ministers say elderly and disabled people themselves  not social workers  should be able to decide on their care and stay in their own homes. they also plan a supremo for adult services in each english area to get different agencies working together. but the government shunned opponents  calls for free long-term care.  there are 1.7m people needing care in england and ministers suggest the number could quadruple by 2050. monday s consultation paper on social care for adults in england is aimed at ending a system which generates dependency. health minister stephen ladyman said:  this document is the antithesis of the nanny state.   it s about taking power away from the state and giving it to individuals and saying that we will help you make these decisions but we are not going to make them for you any more.  the government has already allowed local councils to give people money so they can pay for their services directly but take-up of the scheme has been  disappointing .  ministers say the new plans would make direct payments simpler and try to counter reluctance in some local councils to use the payments. they also want to set up a new  half-way house  where social workers tell people how much money is available for their care and help them choose how to spend that  individual budget . the scheme will be funded on existing budgets set until 2008. but mr ladyman said the plans could deliver savings in some areas  such as freeing up nhs beds and preventing illnesses. he ruled out free personal care in england - which is on offer in scotland and wales  saying it was  unsustainable .  david rogers  from the local government association  said agencies were working together on the kind of innovation proposed by the government. and tony hunter  president of the association of directors of social services  said the plans could improve dignity and well-being for thousands of people. but age concern argued social care was chronically under-funded and older people were being offered choice in principle  but not in practice. its director general  gordon lishman  said:  direct payments will not work if there are no services for people to choose from locally.   the tories say people who pay for three years  long-term care directly or through insurance should be guaranteed free care for the rest of their lives. tory spokesman simon burns said more than 80 000 long term care places had been lost since 1997.  after eight years of persistent change  dogmatic enforcement of regulation  and overbearing government initiatives - we need action  not a vision   said mr burns. the lib dems say they would fund free personal care by a new 50% tax rate on incomes over £100 000. health spokesman paul burstow said:  promoting independence sounds good and helping people to live in their own homes is a goal we share.  but the risk is that independence can turn into isolation if the right support and care is not available.,plan give elderli care control elderli disabl peopl would choos budget person care spent organis govern plan minist say elderli disabl peopl social worker abl decid care stay home also plan supremo adult servic english area get differ agenc work togeth govern shun oppon call free longterm care m peopl need care england minist suggest number could quadrupl monday consult paper social care adult england aim end system gener depend health minist stephen ladyman say document antithesi nanni state take power away state give individu say help make decis go make govern alreadi allow local council give peopl money pay servic directli takeup scheme disappoint minist say new plan would make direct payment simpler tri counter reluct local council use payment also want set new halfway hous social worker tell peopl much money avail care help choos spend individu budget scheme fund exist budget set mr ladyman say plan could deliv save area free nh bed prevent ill rule free person care england offer scotland wale say unsustain david roger local govern associ say agenc work togeth kind innov propos govern toni hunter presid associ director social servic say plan could improv digniti wellb thousand peopl age concern argu social care chronic underfund old peopl offer choic principl practic director gener gordon lishman say direct payment work servic peopl choos local torus say peopl pay three year longterm care directli insur guarante free care rest live torus spokesman simon burn say long term care place lose sinc eight year persist chang dogmat enforc regul overbear govern initi need action vision say mr burn lib dem say would fund free person care new tax rate incom £ health spokesman paul burstow say promot independ sound good help peopl live home goal share risk independ turn isol right support care avail

135,1125,uk s  useless  quangos under fire the uk has 529 quangos financed with billions of pounds of taxpayers  cash - many of which are useless or duplicate each other s efforts  a report claims.  essential guide to british quangos 2005 author dan lewis said at least 111 of the appointed bodies had been set up since labour won power in 1997. he urged a limit on the number of quangos that could be set up by any individual government department. tories and lib dems welcomed the report and called for a  slimming down .  conservative deregulation spokesman john redwood said:  the research endorses our policy of destroying unwanted and unnecessary quangos  and slimming down the rest.   a conservative government will axe 162 quangos  as part of its drive for more efficient and more accountable government.  lib dem spokesman ed davey meanwhile said instead of the  bonfire of quangos  new labour had promised  there had been an  explosion  of them.  for over two decades  under both tory and labour governments  these unaccountable agencies have mushroomed.  liberal democrats would abolish many  merge others  and make any that remain properly accountable.  labour representatives were unavailable for comment. the quango guide follows last year s government-commissioned gershon report which recommended significant cuts in bureaucracy across the public sector.  mr lewis wants a public inquiry into regional development agencies which cost £1.8bn a year - cash he says which  appears to be almost entirely wasted . as well as a departmental limit on quangos he also wants a statutory five-year limit on any such body with executive powers. he also listed what he dubbed the nine  most useless quangos . they were the british potato council  the milk development council  the energy savings trust  agricultural wages committees  the wine standards board  the westminster foundation for democracy  the football licensing authority  investors in people uk and the economic and social research council. mr lewis branded the existence of the 60-employee potato council  set up in 1997 to research and promote overseas potato markets   surprising . he said the £80m spent annually on the energy savings trust  which promotes renewable energy  would be better spent on eight million boiler jackets for british homes.  and he argued it was  absurd  to charge farmers for agricultural wages committees  which set working and wage standards in the industry  when many were prepared to take advantage of immigrant labour prepared to work for £1 an hour.  if a football team can afford to pay £27m for wayne rooney  why should the taxpayer - not all of whom like football - be forced to fund the football licensing authority to the tune of over £1.1m a year   mr lewis asked. the report is published by the efficiency in government unit - a joint effort by right of centre think tanks the economic research council and the centre for policy studies. it says before a new public body is set up  an assessment should be made whether its proposed role is already carried out by an existing charity or other private organisation.,uk useless quango fire uk quango financ billion pound taxpay cash mani useless duplic effort report claim essenti guid british quango author dan lewi say least appoint bodi set sinc labour power urg limit number quango could set individu govern depart torus lib dem welcom report call slim conserv deregul spokesman john redwood say research endors polici destroy unwant unnecessari quango slim rest conserv govern axe quango part drive effici account govern lib dem spokesman ed davey meanwhil say instead bonfir quango new labour promis explos two decad torus labour govern unaccount agenc mushroom liber democrat would abolish mani merg other make remain properli account labour repres unavail comment quango guid follow last year governmentcommiss gershon report recommend signific cut bureaucraci across public sector mr lewi want public inquiri region develop agenc cost £bn year cash say appear almost entir wast well department limit quango also want statutori fiveyear limit bodi execut power also list dub nine useless quango british potato council milk develop council energi save trust agricultur wage committe wine standard board westminst foundat democraci footbal licens author investor peopl uk econom social research council mr lewi brand exist employe potato council set research promot oversea potato market surpris say £m spent annual energi save trust promot renew energi would well spent eight million boiler jacket british home argu absurd charg farmer agricultur wage committe set work wage standard industri mani prepar take advantag immigr labour prepar work £ hour footbal team afford pay £m wayn rooney taxpay like footbal forc fund footbal licens author tune £m year mr lewi ask report publish effici govern unit joint effort right centr think tank econom research council centr polici studi say new public bodi set ass make whether propos role alreadi carri exist chariti privat organis

138,490,cairn shares slump on oil setback shares in cairn energy  a uk oil firm  have closed down 18% after a disappointing drilling update and a warning over possible tax demands.  the company said tests had shown no significant finds in one of its indian oil fields  but was upbeat about the potential of other areas. it also said the indian government had told it to pay a production tax  for which cairn argues it is not liable. cairn s shares have jumped by almost 400% this year. investors had piled into cairn after the company announced significant oil finds in india this year. chief executive bill gammell said on friday he was  disappointed  with exploration in the so-called n-c extension area in rajasthan. investors had held high hopes of major oil finds in this area. but cairn said estimates had been revised in what was a  significant downgrade of the initial expectation .  cairn also said that the government believed the company was liable to pay taxes under its production-sharing contract. the company said the rate would be about 900 rupees ($20.40; £10.50) per tonne  or seven barrels  of oil. a spokesman for the firm said that the tax would wipe 5% of the field s current value.   cairn refutes the government s position   mr gammell said. he insisted that the contract made it clear that the tax should be shouldered by the licensee - india s state-run oil & natural gas corp (ongc) - and not the contractor.  we have a pretty strong legal case here   he added  saying it would only become an issue once the firm started production. investors took a dim view of the statements though. the shares closed down 247p  or 18%  at 1115 pence.  i think people were slightly over-ambitious for how quickly cairn would be able to develop and potentially offload these reserves   said analyst jason kenney at ing.  the disappointments overshadowed increased production targets for cairn s existing oilfields. the company raised targets for its mangala and aishwariya fields in india from 60 000 barrels a day to between 80 000 and 100 000 barrels a day. its mangala field  thought to contain a billion barrels  is its biggest find to date.  these two fields will provide the core of the future developments in rajasthan   mr gammell said. cairn added that it would be appraising another field early next year. mr gammell set up the company in the 1980s and has successfully switched its focus to south asia from interests in the us and europe. cairn  which also operates in nepal and bangladesh  was catapulted into the ftse 100 index of leading uk shares earlier this year after the sharp rise in its share price.,cairn share slump oil setback share cairn energi uk oil firm close disappoint drill updat warn possibl tax demand compani say test show signific find one indian oil field upbeat potenti area also say indian govern told pay product tax cairn argu liabl cairn share jump almost year investor pile cairn compani announc signific oil find india year chief execut bill gammel say friday disappoint explor socal nc extens area rajasthan investor held high hope major oil find area cairn say estim revis signific downgrad initi expect cairn also say govern believ compani liabl pay tax productionshar contract compani say rate would rupe £ per tonn seven barrel oil spokesman firm say tax would wipe field current valu cairn refut govern posit mr gammel say insist contract make clear tax shoulder license india staterun oil natur ga corp ongc contractor pretti strong legal case ad say would becom issu firm start product investor take dim view statement though share close p penc think peopl slightli overambiti quickli cairn would abl develop potenti offload reserv say analyst jason kenney ing disappoint overshadow increas product target cairn exist oilfield compani rais target mangala aishwariya field india barrel day barrel day mangala field thought contain billion barrel big find date two field provid core futur develop rajasthan mr gammel say cairn ad would apprais anoth field earli next year mr gammel set compani s success switch focu south asia interest u europ cairn also oper nepal bangladesh catapult ftse index lead uk share earlier year sharp rise share price

142,793,fast moving phone viruses appear security firms are warning about several mobile phone viruses that can spread much faster than similar bugs.  the new strains of the cabir mobile phone virus use short-range radio technology to leap to any vulnerable phone as soon as it is in range. the cabir virus only affects high-end handsets running the symbian series 60 phone operating system. despite the warnings  there are so far no reports of any phones being infected by the new variants of cabir.  the original cabir worm came to light in mid-june 2004 when it was sent to anti-virus firms as a proof-of-concept program. a mistake in the way the original cabir was written meant that even if it escaped from the laboratory  the bug would only have been able to infect one phone at a time.  however  the new cabir strains have this mistake corrected and will spread via short range bluetooth technology to any vulnerable phone in range. bluetooth has an effective range of a few tens of metres. the risk of being infected by cabir is low because users must give the malicious program permission to download on to their handset and then must manually install it. users can protect themselves by altering a setting on symbian phones that conceals the handset from other bluetooth using devices. finnish security firm f-secure issued a warning about the new strains of cabir but said that the viruses do not do any damage to a phone. all they do is block normal bluetooth activity and drain the phone s battery. anti-virus firm sophos said the source code for cabir had been posted on the net by a brazilian programmer which might lead to even more variants of the program being created. so far seven versions of cabir are know to exist  one of which was inside the malicious skulls program that was found in late november. symbian s series 60 software is licenced by nokia  lg electronics  lenovo  panasonic  samsung  sendo and siemens.,fast move phone virus appear secur firm warn sever mobil phone virus spread much faster similar bug new strain cabir mobil phone viru use shortrang radio technolog leap vulner phone soon rang cabir viru affect highend handset run symbian seri phone oper system despit warn far report phone infect new variant cabir origin cabir worm come light midjun sent antiviru firm proofofconcept program mistak way origin cabir write meant even escap laboratori bug would abl infect one phone time howev new cabir strain mistak correct spread via short rang bluetooth technolog vulner phone rang bluetooth effect rang ten metr risk infect cabir low user must give malici program permiss download handset must manual instal user protect alter set symbian phone conceal handset bluetooth use devic finnish secur firm fsecur issu warn new strain cabir say virus damag phone block normal bluetooth activ drain phone batteri antiviru firm sopho say sourc code cabir post net brazilian programm might lead even variant program creat far seven version cabir know exist one insid malici skull program found late novemb symbian seri softwar licenc nokia lg electron lenovo panason samsung sendo siemen

145,440,lib dems  to target stamp duty  the liberal democrats are promising to raise the stamp duty threshold if they win the general election  in a bid to court first-time house buyers.  vince cable  the party s treasury spokesman  said raising the threshold to £150 000 would prevent over 400 000 home-buyers from paying the tax. he said first-time buyers were being  squeezed out  of the housing market. the labour party said the liberal democrats needed to explain how they would pay for the plan. the plan forms part of a wider lib dems policy to encourage first time buyers and those on lower incomes into the market.  under the proposals  the average saving for a new buyer would be more than £1 000  according to mr cable.  first time buyers are being squeezed out of the housing market not only by higher house prices but also by being swept into the stamp duty net   he said.  by failing to uprate the stamp duty threshold gordon brown has hit first time buyers and those on low incomes the hardest.  by pledging to increase the threshold to £150 000  the liberal democrats will make it possible for many first time buyers to buy a property without facing this tax.  paul boateng mp  labour s chief secretary to the treasury  said:  the lib dems  sums don t add up.  they can have no credibility until they can say how they would fund their ever growing list of tax and spending commitments.  mr cable will publish his  alternative budget  on monday.,lib dem target stamp duti liber democrat promis rais stamp duti threshold win gener elect bid court firsttim hous buyer vinc cabl parti treasuri spokesman say rais threshold £ would prevent homebuy pay tax say firsttim buyer squeez hous market labour parti say liber democrat need explain would pay plan plan form part wider lib dem polici encourag first time buyer low incom market propos averag save new buyer would £ accord mr cabl first time buyer squeez hous market high hous price also swept stamp duti net say fail uprat stamp duti threshold gordon brown hit first time buyer low incom hardest pledg increas threshold £ liber democrat make possibl mani first time buyer buy properti without face tax paul boateng mp labour chief secretari treasuri say lib dem sum add credibl say would fund ever grow list tax spend commit mr cabl publish altern budget monday
146,2192,iraqi voters turn to economic issues beyond the desperate security situation in iraq lies an economy in tatters.  a vicious cycle of unemployment  poor social services and poverty has been made worse by a lack of investment. so there is much hope that an elected government will break the deadlock.  first rule of law  then the economy   says radwan hadi  deputy managing director of aberdeen-based oil and gas consultancy blackwatch petroleum services  which entered iraq in 2003. mr hadi s view about what the new government s priorities should be is shared by many iraqis. the economy has become the second-most dominant issue for many political parties ahead of sunday s election  according to bristol university political scientist anne alexander  who is working on a project that looks at governance and security in post-war iraq.  job creation ranks high both on election manifestos and on the iraqi people s wish list. nobody knows exactly how many iraqis are out of work  but it is clear that the situation is dire.  estimates of iraq s unemployment rate vary  but we estimate it to be between 30-40%   the washington-based independent think-tank the brookings institution says in its iraq index. but some progress has been made  largely thanks to the country s oil revenues which have exceeded $22bn since june 2003.  iraq s infrastructure is on the mend  with notable improvements having been made in areas such as electricity supply  irrigation  telephone networks and the re-opening of hospitals. but serious problems remain and the growing divide between haves and have-nots is angering voters. one iraqi woman told ms alexander about her frustration as she watched tv adverts for private hospitals soon after having failed to track down basic medicines from baghdad s pharmacies. observes mr hadi:  the economy at present marks a big divide; the rich get richer  the poor get poorer.  an indication of this can be seen in the world of finance where  in contrast with the daily plight of ordinary people  19 private banks operate  only one of which is run in accordance with islamic banking principles. hopes are high for the future of finance  so foreign banks have been buying into the sector. national bank of kuwait has bought a majority stake in credit bank of iraq  the jordanian investment bank export & finance bank has bought 49% of national bank of iraq.  foreign firms also hope to cash in on the reconstruction effort. bechtel s efforts to rebuild schools and restore power have attracted controversy as well as boosting its bottom line while halliburton has enjoyed a wealth of military contracts. but the involvement of foreign firms in the health and banking sectors and beyond sits uneasily with many iraqis who are accustomed to the state taking responsibility for functions that are essential to making society work  observes ms alexander.  it is seen as a selling off of iraq s assets and bringing in multinationals at the expense of iraqi businesses and iraqi workers   she says. consequently  the transitional government has been forced to backtrack in recent months over its proposal to allow 100% foreign ownership of iraqi assets  she explains. in the west  it is easy to forget that the otherwise brutal baathist regime used to look after the majority of iraq s citizens rather well in terms of job creation  social security and healthcare. opinion polls suggest that  people still want the state to take a leading role in providing these things   ms alexander says.  yet in some areas of the economy  investment from abroad is still warmly welcomed  insists mr hadi  an iraqi who left the country three decades ago.  i think the private sector will evolve incredibly fast   mr hadi says.  iraq s vast natural resources can support any magnitude of economic growth.   many foreign companies say they are keen to get in on the act  yet few are actually entering the country in any meaningful way. but there are exceptions. mr hadi s blackwatch is just one of many small operators preparing for a much bigger future. blackwatch s baghdad-based affiliate falcon group has dozens of people working for it across the country in kirkuk and baghdad  and its engineers and geo-scientists work with the iraqi oil ministry to hammer out technology transfer issues  mr hadi points out.  these guys are trying to work. the iraqi business people will do business at all times.  life goes on in iraq  the people take responsibility  they want to live normal lives.,iraqi voter turn econom issu beyond

147,2117,a decade of good website design the web looks very different today than it did 10 years ago.  back in 1994  yahoo had only just launched  most websites were text-based and amazon  google and ebay had yet to appear. but  says usability guru dr jakob nielsen  some things have stayed constant in that decade  namely the principles of what makes a site easy to use. dr nielsen has looked back at a decade of work on usability and considered whether the 34 core guidelines drawn up back then are relevant to the web of today.  roughly 80% of the things we found 10 years ago are still an issue today   he said.  some have gone away because users have changed and 10% have changed because technology has changed.   some design crimes  such as splash screens that get between a user and the site they are trying to visit  and web designers indulging their artistic urges have almost disappeared  said dr nielsen.   but there s great stability on usability concerns   he told the bbc news website. dr nielsen said the basic principles of usability  centring around ease of use and clear thinking about a site s total design  were as important as ever.  it s necessary to be aware of these things as issues because they remain as such   he said. they are still important because the net has not changed as much as people thought it would.  a lot of people thought that design and usability was only a temporary problem because broadband was taking off   he said.  but there are a very small number of cases where usability issues go away because you have broadband.   dr nielsen said the success of sites such as google  amazon  ebay and yahoo showed that close attention to design and user needs was important.  those four sites are extremely profitable and extremely successful   said dr nielsen  adding that they have largely defined commercial success on the net.   all are based on user empowerment and make it easy for people to do things on the internet   he said.  they are making simple but powerful tools available to the user.  none of them have a fancy or glamorous look   he added  declaring himself surprised that these sites have not been more widely copied. in the future  dr nielsen believes that search engines will play an even bigger part in helping people get to grips with the huge amount of information online.  they are becoming like the operating system to the internet   he said. but  he said  the fact that they are useful now does not meant that they could not do better. currently  he said  search sites did not do a very good job of describing the information that they return in response to queries. often people had to look at a website just to judge whether it was useful or not. tools that watch the behaviour of people on websites to see what they actually find useful could also help refine results. research by dr nielsen shows that people are getting more sophisticated in their use of search engines. the latest statistics on how many words people use on search engines shows that  on average  they use 2.2 terms. in 1994 only 1.3 words were used.  i think it s amazing that we have seen a doubling in a 10-year period of those search terms   said dr nielsen.  you can hear more from jakob nielsen and web design on the bbc world service programme  go digital,decad good websit design web look differ today year ago back yahoo launch websit textbas

148,153,lib dems demand new inquiry a judge should look into the david blunkett controversy as key questions remain unanswered  the lib dems say.  sir alan budd s inquiry linked the ex-home secretary to the speeding up of a visa claim by his ex-lover s nanny. but he could not say whether mr blunkett had treated the nanny as a special case or had used her as an example of immigration problems. lib dem spokesman mark oaten said the number of officials who had forgotten what happened was worrying. he told bbc news:  i m extremely concerned that 20 individuals appear to have forgotten what happened or more suspiciously are not prepared to say what happened.  that must be bad for government  it must be bad for public confidence in the system.   mr oaten said people would be mystified why sir alan s inquiry failed to uncover why processing of the visa application was speeded up. he said:  there is a strong case for a judge-led judicial review of this because  of course  next time it happens it may not be about a nanny and their visa. it may be about something even more important than that.  so we do need to understand what took place and who was involved.  the tories criticised the lib dem stance  saying mr oaten had initially said he accepted mr blunkett s word unless further evidence emerged. but lib dem officials say mr oaten was speaking when an inquiry was under way and was avoiding rushing to judgement.,lib dem demand new inquiri judg look david blunkett controversi key question remain unansw lib dem say sir alan budd inquiri link exhom secretari speed visa claim exlov nanni could say whether mr blunkett treat nanni special case use exampl immigr problem lib dem spokesman mark oaten say number offici forgotten happen worri told bbc news extrem concern individu appear forgotten happen suspici prepar say happen must bad govern must bad public confid system mr oaten say peopl would mystifi sir alan inquiri fail uncov process visa applic speed say strong case judgel judici review cours next time happen may nanni visa may someth even import need understand take place involv torus criticis lib dem stanc say mr oaten initi say accept mr blunkett word unless evid emerg lib dem offici say mr oaten speak inquiri way avoid rush judgement
149,678,minimum wage increased to £5.05 the minimum wage will rise in october  benefiting more than 1m people  the government has announced.  adults must be paid at least £5.05 an hour  up from £4.85  while 18 to 21 year olds will be paid £4.25. the recommendations came from the low pay commission which said the number of jobs had continued to grow since the minimum wage was introduced in 1999. businesses wanted it frozen  warning more rises could damage competitiveness but the unions want a £6 rate.  a further increase in the adult rate to £5.35 an hour is provisionally scheduled for october 2006. according to the commission  many businesses had found the last two significant increases in the minimum wage  challenging .  we have therefore recommended only a slight increase above average earnings  and concentrated it in the second year to allow business more time to absorb the impact   said chairman adair turner. the government says most of those on the minimum wage are women - with many working in cleaning  catering  shops and hairdressing.  unveiling the latest increase  mr blair said he wanted the minimum wage to become a  symbol of decency and fairness .  for too long  poverty pay capped the aspiration and prosperity of far too many hard-working families   he said.  too often  people were told to make a choice between the indignity of unemployment or the humiliation of poverty pay.  chancellor gordon brown and transport secretary alistair darling promoted the news in edinburgh  wales secretary peter hain and welsh first minister rhodri morgan in cardiff and northern ireland minister john spellar in belfast. the government has not accepted the commission s recommendation that 21-year-olds should be paid at the adult rate  but says it will look again at the rate later on. mr brown said:  we want to do nothing that can damage the employment opportunities for young people  particularly young people entering the labour market for the first time.  the government has said it will look at tougher action against the small number of employers who consistently refuse to pay the minimum wage.  the national minimum wage is currently set at £4.85 per hour for those aged 22 and above  and at £4.10 for those aged 18 to 21. a £3 per hour minimum wage was introduced last october for 16 to 17-year-olds  but apprentices are exempt. the trade unions congress welcomed the increase  but has called for a £6 minimum wage by next year. but the confederation of british industry (cbi) called for a  pause year  to assess the impact of the above inflation rise in the minimum wage in october. and david frost  director of the british chambers of commerce  said:  the level of increase each year has increased by rates far outstripping the rates of inflation.  what employers are saying to us now is that it s at a level where it s starting to bite into the competitiveness of companies right across the country.   the liberal democrats  economics spokesman vincent cable said he supported the move to raise the minimum wage.  it s not just good for the workers themselves but it lifts them out of benefits and therefore is good for the exchequer too   he said. conservative leader michael howard said he accepted the principle of the minimum wage and would not  seek to disturb  the increase. speaking on bbc radio 4 s woman s hour  mr howard hinted the tories might go into the general election with a promise to cancel income tax for the lowest-paid workers.  there are people on very low salaries  very low incomes indeed who really shouldn t be paying income tax   he said.  it would be better to decrease taxes on earnings below £12 000 a year  with say no tax on below £6 000. the losses in tax can be recouped by having a 50pc tax band for people making over £100 000. our minimum wage is going to be effectively almost twice the us minimum wage  yet our economy per person is only 2/3rds of the us! perhaps  we have to really starting questioning why some products cost 50-60% more here than they do in the us. this combined with the tax decreases would make the pounds the low-paid people do make go much further.  it s still not good enough! i got a part time job at 16 when i was doing my a-levels in an attempt to get a little money saved for uni. this was only 2 years ago and i was getting paid £2.75 an hour  and working as hard as any of the older staff  maybe it s about time 16 - 21 year olds got a fair wage!  we must remember that the minimum wage is only part of the picture and must not rise to a level that makes employing people unattractive and encourages businesses to send work and therefore jobs abroad. still government and local councils employ staff via their contractors that pay at the minimum wage or very close to it. an easy way for the government to do as it preaches would be to insist on floor pay levels for all government workers and take tens of thousand of civil servants out of the social security system all together.  any increase is certainly welcome news. however for all those whining about the pressures of an increase in the minimum wage i would simply ask them:  would you be happy to work for less than £5.05 an hour  . thought not ... so then  don t expect others to either.  i can t believe that so many of these comments are against the minimum wage! also i personally take great offence at the insinuation that people earning minimum wage were lazy at school if everyone went to university then who would serve you in the supermarkets and clean up after you  it s about time that these hardworking people are rewarded with only what they deserve and have earned fair pay and a bit of respect wouldn t go a miss either. br /&gt;  this is good news. the minimum wage has put a sense of equality back into a worker s relationship with their employer. wages are supposed to be a fair reflection of an employee s efforts. for too long wages were a point of exploitation - what could an employer get away with. in very simplistic terms this put a pressure to keep low-paid wages low. with the minimum wage this downward pressure is at least partly removed.  it is also interesting to read the comments from so called business leaders. they are the first to defend the rights and privileges of boards to award fat-cat salaries  bonuses and pension rights to the select few but they are the first to attack policies that are put in place to merely defend the rights of those that really make those fat cats purr!  i feel there are both negatives and positives to the increase  on one hand some businesses will struggle to stay afloat but on the other hand in today world many young people can t afford to move out as property costs too much and only by earning more will they be able to get on in life. its true many may get complacent but the minimum wage could be looked at as more of a stepping stone rather than a hand out.  here come the usual whines about how difficult it will be for businesses! we all remember michael howard s protestations that the minimum wage would cost a million jobs when it was introduced - funny how he s gone quiet on that one! jobs have continued to increase since this humane legislation was brought in. i think if any job is worth doing then it s worth being paid a fair wage for  and £5.05 is hardly a fortune. if your business cannot pay its workers a decent wage then maybe it s not being run properly and if it folds  a better-run company will take over its duties and employ more people  so everybody wins except incompetent business owners!  great keep at it tony  i remember the despair of the 80s and the low wages employers got away with. at last we can make a difference to people and reward them for working. we can t afford not to pay a decent wage. it s not a jobs at any price economy  goodbye sweatshops hello decency.  the increase in minimum wage is a good thing. living in the southwest where house prices and rent have increased hugely (like the rest of the country) over the past 5 years has made living for you average 18-21 years old very difficult. in the south west the increase in living costs have not been matched by an increase in pay  for example a job i did in plymouth was underpaid to an equivalent worker in exeter by 75p an hour. hopefully the increase in the minimum wage will bring in to balance pay on a regional and national level  and in turn allow people like myself who do work hard  but might never earn a 6 figure salary the chance to branch out on our own.  i work at a large hospital where the contractors providing all ancillary services - domestic  catering & portering etc - pay the minimum wage of £4.85 as the basic rate. someone has to do these unglamorous jobs and earn enough to live decently. how dare people suggest we are lazy or complacent for accepting these jobs and these wages  who do they think will be carrying out these public service jobs if contractors are allowed to pay as little as their consciences allow   this is definitely the right step in the right direction. it shows that this government cares for the low income earners as well. this is a million votes more. good strategy isn t it   although i would not deny people the minimum wage increase  its timing stinks. i am quite prepared for a raft of  bribes  to come from the government before the election and a raft of taxes afterwards  they are playing us for the fools they think we are.  this is extremely bad news for any business - whether they are small and medium enterprises or even large companies. by increasing overheads  for business  there will be an almost certain rise in costs to the consumer who while they openly welcome the idea of an increase in the minimum wage are the same people who still want to buy that shirt  or that pair of trainers for next to nothing. the extra cost this increase will bring  will only be reflected in the price of the goods we buy  which  in turn will only serve to discourage companies from setting-up business in the uk  or encourage those companies already based here to look elsewhere. the jubilation felt by  low-paid  workers here will soon give way to misery as they lose their jobs.  this will only lead to a reduction in jobs. why have many of the call centre jobs gone to india. blair say s the economy is  strong and stable economy  however consumer debt and the country s debt is at its highest and now they heap this onto businesses  that will have no choice but to cut the workforce.  the timing cannot be coincidental. this is blatant electioneering and should be exposed as such.  andrew in derby complains that raising the minimum wage is  blatant electioneering . i don t mind if it is. in our degraded democracy  elections are the one time when elites really have to worry about doing something concrete for the majority. my only complaint is the paltry figures being discussed. if my maths is right  a 35 hour week at £5.05 gives you an annual income just over £9 000 and raising it to £6 leaves it under £11 000. the unions should be putting the government under pressure for much more. businesses complaining might like to take a look at corporate pay  shareholder payouts and profits before wondering if paying a living wage is really a controlling factor in the viability of their firm.  i am all for lifting the minimum wage of workers to a reasonable level  but we have to accept that with this will come competition from overseas workers. also small businesses will have to be able to afford this manpower cost. we are already seeing a sweeping change in it work being lost to india where people are paid much less. it is difficult for me to understand that only five years ago cheap labour abroad was classified as  sweat shop   but now we are told it is global competition. with our manufacturing industry in serious decline the country cannot be entirely service industries without something tangible to serve. there has to be something at the top of the food chain and that is manufacturing. the whole picture needs to be looked at.  this is great news  but that might be because i work for minimum wage. seems a good idea and will hopefully be an incentive to those who live to claim to actually get a job. when you can  earn  more from claiming than you can from work  there is no incentive. perhaps a step in the right direction.  if the tuc get their way a very large number of smes will have to close - this will put more people out of work. how then will the government fudge the unemployment figures! the government know it is not big business that keeps the economy going but the smes but we always get overlooked  they will only take notice if these large corporations close and move to other countries  after all they are predominantly owned by foreign companies. we are a specialist company but with these increases have already had an effect on us and we have lost work another one will close us.  while i m delighted for those on low pay that this increase is being put forward  i am extremely concerned at the implications for small businesses. as an employee for a small nursery  i know this increase will cause great hardship for my employer  who has been unable to increase salaries for higher paid employees because of last october s increase for the lower paid employees - who were originally being paid slightly above the minimum but are now on the minimum. this latest increase of 20p an hour will cause even more financial hardship. if the rate rises to £6 then i can foresee many small businesses having to pay off employees.  the increase in minimum wage will have a serious effect on my business. although we pay above the minimum level we will have to increase our pay rates to maintain the differential. the raise is well above inflation and without significant increases in sales  it will mean that i will not be taking on a new member of staff as planned and i will be looking to reduce the total hours worked by the other members of staff  overtime being the first to go.  i currently employ 42 staff whose wages mirror the national minimum wage. increases above inflation are fine but all of my business is conducted with local authorities who will not accept above inflation rises in my service delivery. 80% of my costs are labour. the other aspect that is always hidden is that the thresholds for tax credits do not move in line with these increases so that all that happens is that employees tax credit support is reduced by the amount of the increase  thereby saving the government money but increasing the financial burden on small to medium businesses  it is very good that the government has decided to increase the minimum wage - this should hopefully motivate people to undertake the  lower status  jobs.  i know about this great idea - don t bother getting qualifications  laze about at school  no need to do anything other than attend so your parents don t get fined because remember  when you do eventually start working  doesn t matter how lazy you are  you ll be guaranteed a decent wage. the ones who suffer are the employers.  i hope that if industry and business have to pay this new rate that mr blair and mr brown will increase tax allowances and raise national insurance thresholds so that the treasury won t take some of this increase off the people they say they are helping  or is this just another form of stealth tax on business through the back door   i don t believe in the minimum wage at all! i think jobs should create their own wage value and that if people want higher wages they should earn them. now  before everyone thinks that i am some  rich-kid   i can assure you i am not. i came from a very much working class background and started work 20 years ago on a youth opportunity program earning £25 per week. i worked hard  went to college part time  got my a-levels and degree & bettered myself. i now earn a 6 figure salary. i did that through hard work and getting off my backside. a minimum wage just makes people complacent.  to ashley  of swindon: when you earned £25 per week  it was worth something. these days that £25 would need to be near to £60 to have the equivalent buying power. i might add  that thanks to successive governments holding down the tax allowance threshold below inflation  people earning the minimum wage are paying taxes that they never would have done 10 years ago at equivalent wages.  in my day  type arguments are a view that belong in the  your day  - 20 years ago!  as a graduate working for minimum wage  i welcome any increase of pay i can get. i disagree with ashley  swindon saying i have to work harder to get more pay. i have my gcse s a-levels and a degree and have chosen to work for a small business that can t afford the wages i should be getting  i should be on at least 3x what i m getting but they can t afford it. we all work hard but the money is just not there. but on the plus side i love my job and wouldn t change it just to get more pay.  as an employer of staff in several shops the last rise in the minimum wage cost my company an additional £5000 per year. these next rises will cost me more. i have to get the money from somewhere so pass it on to customers. so no one really wins in the end.  in answer to emma from sleaford regarding no one really wins in the end... on the contrary mr blair wins - he wins because he obviously has announced this to be a vote winner and his treasury wins because as an employer you will know that the amount of tax and national insurance that the government will receive from all the minimum wage increases will rise and of course not only will be paying out higher wages but as an employer higher employer ni contributions as well. if the minimum wage increases again and if it hits anywhere near the £6.00 mark there will be 12 more people on the employment line and one more small business going bankrupt - namely mine. think of us employers as well mr blair  we are not all big corporations earning millions.  all workers should be entitled to a fair day s pay for a fair day s work. how many people on the minimum wage have any hope of obtaining a mortgage or saving towards retirement   it is good news for many asians living in uk. students who do odd jobs can increase their income and can help there family in their home country. i thank mr. blair and his government for increase in the national minimum wage.,minimum wage increas £ minimum wage rise octob benefit m

152,1993,us peer-to-peer pirates convicted the first convictions for piracy over peer-to-peer networks have been handed down in the us.  new yorker william trowbridge and texan michael chicoine have pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music  movies and software. the two men faced charges following raids in august on suspected pirates by the fbi. the pair face jail terms of up to five years and a $250 000 (£130 000) fine.  in a statement the us department of justice said the two men operated the central hubs in a piracy community organised across the direct connect peer-to-peer network. the piracy group called itself the underground network and membership of it demanded that users share between one and 100 gigabytes of files. direct connect allows users to set themselves up as central servers that act as co-ordinating spots for sharers. users would swap files  such as films and music  by exchanging data over the network. during its investigation fbi agents reportedly downloaded 84 movies  40 software programs  13 games and 178  sound recordings  from the five hubs that made up the larger piracy group. the raids were organised under the umbrella of operation digital gridlock which was aimed at fighting  criminal copyright theft on peer-to-peer networks . in total  six raids were carried out in august. five were on the homes of suspected copyright thieves and one on a net service firm. the department of justice said that both men pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit felony copyright infringement. they also pleaded guilty to acting for commercial advantage. the two men are due to be sentenced on 29 april.,u peertop pirat convict first convict piraci peertop network hand u new yorker william trowbridg texan michael chicoin plead guilti charg infring copyright illeg share music movi softwar two men face charg follow raid august suspect pirat fbi pair face jail term five year £ fine statement u depart justic say two men oper central hub piraci commun organis across direct connect peertop network piraci group call underground network membership demand user share one gigabyt file direct connect allow user set central server act coordin spot sharer user would swap file film music exchang data network investig fbi agent reportedli download movi softwar program game sound record five hub make large piraci group raid organis umbrella oper digit gridlock aim fight crimin copyright theft peertop network total six raid carri august five home suspect copyright thiev one net servic firm depart justic say men plead guilti one count conspiraci commit feloni copyright infring also plead guilti act commerci advantag two men due sentenc april

155,2116,cabs collect mountain of mobiles gadgets are cheaper  smaller and more common than ever. but that just means we are more likely to lose them.  in london alone over the past six months more than 63 000 mobile phones have been left in the back of black cabs  according to a survey. that works out at about three phones per cab. over the same period almost 5 000 laptops and 5 800 pdas such as palms and pocket pcs were left in licensed cabs. even the great and good are not immune to losing their beloved gadgets. jemima khan reportedly left her ipod  phone and purse in a cab and asked for them to be returned to her friend who turned out to be hugh grant. as the popularity of portable gadgets has grown  and we trust more of our lives to them  we seem to be forgetting them in ever larger numbers. the numbers of lost laptops has leapt by 71% in the last three years.  this has left londoners  or those travelling by cab in the capital  as the world s best at losing laptops  according to the research by the licensed taxi drivers association and pointsec  a mobile-data backup firm. more than twice as many laptops were left in the back of black cabs in london as in any of the nine other cities (helsinki  oslo  munich  paris  stockholm  copenhagen  chicago and sydney) where the research into lost and found gadgets was carried out. by contrast danes were most adept at losing mobile phones being seven times more likely to leave it behind in a cab than travellers in germans  norwegians and swedes. top of the range phones can carry enormous amounts of data - enough to hold hundreds of pictures or thousands of contact details. given that few people back up the data on their pc it is a fair bet that even fewer do so with the phone they carry around. you could be losing a fair chunk of your life in the back of that cab not least because many people collect numbers on their phone that they do not have anywhere else.  equally  phones let you navigate through contacts by name so many people have completely forgotten their friends  numbers and could not reconstruct them if they had to. this growing habit of losing gadgets explains the rise of firms such as retrofone which lets people buy a cheap old-fashioned phone to replace the tiny  shiny expensive one they have just lost. briton s growing love of phones has also led to the creation of the mobile equipment national database that lets you register the unique id number of your phone so it can be returned to you in the event of it being lost or stolen. according to statistics 50% of all muggings and snatch theft offences involve mobiles. millions of gadgets are now logged in the database and organisations such as transport for london regularly consult it when trying to re-unite folk with their phones and other gadgets. for the drivers  finding a mobile in the back of their cab is one of the more pleasant things many have found. the survey of what else has been left behind included a harp  a dog  a hamster and a baby.,cab collect mountain mobil gadget cheaper small common ever mean like lose london alon past six month mobil phone left back black cab accord survey work three phone per cab period almost laptop pda palm pocket pc left licens cab even great good immun lose belov gadget jemima khan reportedli left ipod phone purs cab ask return friend turn hugh grant popular portabl gadget grown trust live seem forget ever large number number lose laptop leapt last three year left london travel cab capit world best lose laptop accord research licens taxi driver associ pointsec mobiledata backup firm twice mani laptop left back black cab london nine citi helsinki oslo munich pari stockholm copenhagen chicago sydney research lose found gadget carri contrast dane adept lose mobil phone seven time like leav behind cab travel german norwegian swede top rang phone carri enorm amount data enough hold hundr pictur thousand contact detail give peopl back data pc fair bet even few phone carri around could lose fair chunk life back cab least mani peopl collect number phone anywher el equal phone let navig contact name mani peopl complet forgotten friend number could reconstruct grow habit lose gadget explain rise firm retrofon let peopl buy cheap oldfashion phone replac tini shini expens one lose briton grow love phone also lead creation mobil equip nation databas let regist uniqu id number phone return event lose steal accord statist mug snatch theft offenc involv mobil million gadget log databas organis transport london regularli consult tri reunit folk phone gadget driver find mobil back cab one pleasant thing mani found survey el left behind includ harp dog hamster babi
156,1394,viewers to be able to shape tv imagine editing titanic down to watch just your favourite bits or cutting out the slushier moments of star wars to leave you with a bare bones action-fest.  manipulating your favourite films to make a more personalised movie is just the beginning of an ambitious new 7.5m euro (£5.1m) project funded by the european union. new media for a new millennium (nm2) will have as its endgame the development of a completely new media genre  which will allow audiences to create their own media worlds based on their specific interests or tastes. viewers will be able to participate in storylines  manipulate plots and even the sets and props of tv shows. bt is one of 13 partners involved in the project. it will be contributing software that was originally designed to spot anomalies in cctv pictures. the software uses content recognition algorithms. the three-year project will work on seven productions as it develops a set of software tools that will allow viewers to edit content to their needs.  one of the productions will be a experimental television show where the plot will be driven by text messages from the tv audience.  participants will text selected words which will impact how the characters in the drama interact. it is being developed in finland and will be shown to finnish tv audiences. another team will work on the bbc s big budget drama of mervyn peake s gothic fantasy gormenghast. it will be re-engineered to allow people to choose a variety of edited versions.  the bbc is allowing us access to the material so that we can prove the technology and the principles   explained dr doug williams of bt  who will be nm2 s technical project manager.  the tv at the moment is a relatively dumb box which receives signals. this project is about teaching the machine to look at content like lego blocks that can be reassembled to make perfect sense   he said.  at the moment we have interactive gaming and a limited form of interactive tv which usually means allowing audiences to vote on shows. we are hoping to occupy the space in-between   he added.  nm2 s co-ordinator peter stollenmayer explained that the new genre would radically alter the role of the audience.   viewers will be able to interact directly with the medium and influence what they see and hear according to their personal tastes and wishes   he said.  media users will no longer be passive viewers but become active engagers.  it will also be important that the tools are sophisticated enough to obey the complex rules of cinematography and editing said john wyver  from tv producer illuminations television limited  which is also involved in the project.  it s not just a matter of stringing together the romantic or action portions of a production   said mr wyver.  the tool has to know which bits fit together both visually  by observing the time-honoured rules that go in editing  and in terms of the story.   only then will the personalised version both make sense and be aesthetically pleasing   he added. mr wyver is planning a production entitled the golden age  about renaissance art. it will allow viewers to create a so-called media world based on their own specific areas of interest such as poetry  music and architecture. other productions that the nm2 team will make range from news  documentaries to a romantic comedy drama.,viewer abl shape tv imagin edit titan watch favourit bit cut slushier moment star war leav bare bone actionfest manipul favourit film make personalis movi begin ambiti new m euro £m

160,672,2004: an irish athletics year 2004 won t be remembered as one of irish athletics  great years.  the year began with that optimism which invariably and unaccountably  seems to herald an upcoming olympiad. but come late august  a few hot days in the magnificent stadium in athens told us of the true strength of irish athletics - or to be more accurate  the lack of it. sonia o sullivan s olympic farewell apart  there was little to stir the emotions of irish athletics watchers. but after the disastrous build-up to the games  we shouldn t have been surprised. at the start of the year  an o sullivan had been earmarked as ireland s best medal prospect but as it turned out  walker gillian never even made it to the start line because of injury. less than a week before the olympics  the sport was rocked by news that 10 000m hope cathal lombard had tested for the banned substance epo. lombard s shattering of mark carroll s national 10 000m record in april had already set tongues wagging but even the most cynical of observers  were surprised when he was rumbled after an irish sports council sting operation. the corkman quickly held his hands up in admission and was promptly handed a two-year ban from the sport.  back at pre-olympic ranch in greece  it must have seemed that things couldn t have got any worse but they very nearly did with walker jamie costin lucky to escape with his life after being involved in a car crash near athens. once the track and field action began in athens  a familiar pattern of underachievement emerged although alistair cragg s performance in being the only athlete from a european nation to qualify for the 5 000m final did offer hope for the future. our beloved sonia scraped into the women s 5k final as a fastest loser and for a couple of days  the country attempted to delude itself into believing that she might be in the medal shake-up. as it happened  she went out the back door early in the final although there was nothing undignified about the way that she insisted on finishing the race over a minute behind winner meseret defar. it later transpired that sonia had been suffering from a stomach bug in the 48 hours before the final although typically  the cobhwoman played down the effects of the illness. amazingly  she was back in action a couple of weeks later when beating a world-class field at the flora lite 5k road race in london and while her major championship days may be over  it s unlikely that we have seen the last of her in competition. at least sonia managed to make it to athens. at the start of the year  several northern ireland athletes had genuine hopes of qualifying for the games but come august  an out-of-form and injured paul brizzel was the lone standard bearer for the province. the ballymena man gave it a lash but his achilles problem  and a bad lane draw  meant a time of 21.00 and an early exit.  james mcilroy  gareth turnbull  zoe brown and paul mckee all had to be content with watching the athens action on their television screens. 800m hope mcilroy never got near his best during the summer and a fourth place in the british trials effectively ended his hopes of making the plane. the injury-plagued turnbull gamely travelled round europe in search of the 1500m qualifying mark but 3:39 was the best he could achieve  after missing several months training during the previous winter. a lingering hamstring probem and a virus wrecked mckee s athens ambitions and both he and turnbull deserve a slice of better fortune in 2005. pole vaulter brown had hoped for a vote of confidence from the british selectors after she had achieved the athens b standard but the call never came. as the summer ended  stalwarts catherina mckiernan and dermot donnelly hung up their competitive spikes. mckiernan had to candidly acknowledge that time had crept up on her after several injury-ravaged years. donnelly and his annadale striders team-mates later suffered tragedy when their friend and clubman andy campbell was found dead at his home on 18 december. a large turnout of athletics-loving folk turned out in west belfast to offer their respects to the campbell family and andy s many friends. as only death can  it put the year s athletics happenings in a sharp perspective.,irish athlet year rememb one irish athlet great year year begin optim invari unaccount seem

161,813,ukip could sue veritas defectors the uk independence party could take legal action to unseat two london assembly members who defected to robert kilroy silk s veritas party.  damian hockney  now veritas deputy leader  and peter hulme-cross were elected in 2004 on the list system. the party argues the pair should give up their seats as they won them as ukip representatives  not as individuals. mr hockney said the law was clear that those elected on a list who quit their party should keep their seats. ukip chairman petrina holdsworth urged the men to step down from the gla in a letter.  she said:  the party has taken legal advice and it is clear that we could take legal proceedings against you which could result in the return of our seats and/or damages against you.  we would however like you to be given an opportunity to reflect on what you have done  to restore your own credibility with the electorate and return the seats to the party which won them fair and square at the last election.  mr hockney said the law worked in exactly the same way for the gla as it did for other electoral list systems.  the greater london act is clear that if someone resigns who was elected on a list  their party whip the seat belongs to them and not the party.  he said mr hulme-cross and himself had no intention of resigning and added that they felt that it was ukip who were not being true to the electorate. he accused the party of signing up to a deal with the tories in europe  rather than sticking to an independent stance. but the claim was denied by ukip spokesman  who said:  mr hockney s accusations are like his sense of political morals - empty.  veritas was formed by mr kilroy-silk earlier this month after he quit ukip following an unsuccessful bid to take over as leader.,ukip could sue verita defector uk independ parti could take legal action unseat two london assembl member defect robert kilroy silk verita parti damian hockney verita deputi leader peter hulmecross elect list system parti argu pair give seat ukip repres individu mr hockney say law clear elect list quit parti keep seat ukip chairman petrina holdsworth urg men step gla letter say parti take legal advic clear could take legal proceed could result return seat andor damag would howev like give opportun reflect do restor credibl elector return seat parti fair squar last elect mr hockney say law work exactli way gla elector list system great london act clear someon resign elect list parti whip seat belong parti say mr hulmecross intent resign ad felt ukip true elector accus parti sign deal torus europ rather stick independ stanc claim deni ukip spokesman say mr hockney accus like sen polit moral empti verita form mr kilroysilk earlier month quit ukip follow unsuccess bid take leader

164,517,labour mp praises tory campaign the conservatives have been  a lot smarter  in the way they have conducted the general election campaign  a labour backbencher has said.  derek wyatt said having a five month campaign  turned off voters  and suggested people were already  rather bored of the thing . he wants a greater campaigning role for chancellor gordon brown. labour said the economy was at the heart of the campaign and mr brown therefore had a prominent role. but mr wyatt argued:  by some way  he is currently the figure in all of the polls that people trust and see that has delivered over eight years an economy unmatched anywhere in the world.  so  it would be a tad foolish of the labour party if we did not use him as we have done over the past three elections.   labour s election chief alan milburn denied there was an attempt to sideline mr brown after facing criticism for letting the tories set the agenda. however  mr wyatt predicted the campaign would get under way properly once the chancellor delivered his budget. the mp for sittingbourne and sheppey said prime minister tony blair had been  trying very hard  to improve his own standing with the electorate through a  sort of campaign of trust . but mr blair had been  hurt  by the iraq controversy  he added. a labour party spokesman played down differences with mr wyatt and said mr brown already had a prominent campaign role.  this election is a choice between labour taking britain forward and the conservatives taking us back.,labour mp prais torus campaign conserv lot smarter way conduct gener elect campaign labour backbench say derek wyatt say five month campaign turn voter suggest peopl alreadi rather bore thing want great campaign role chancellor gordon brown labour say economi heart campaign mr brown therefor promin role mr wyatt argu way current figur poll peopl trust see deliv eight year economi unmatch anywher world would tad foolish labour parti use do past three elect labour elect chief alan milburn deni attempt sidelin mr brown face critic let torus set agenda howev mr wyatt predict campaign would get way properli chancellor deliv budget mp sittingbourn sheppey say prime minist toni blair tri hard improv stand elector sort campaign trust mr blair hurt iraq controversi ad labour parti spokesman play differ mr wyatt say mr brown alreadi promin campaign role elect choic labour take britain forward conserv take u back

166,2168,no re-draft  for eu patent law a proposed european law on software patents will not be re-drafted by the european commission (ec) despite requests by meps.  the law is proving controversial and has been in limbo for a year. some major tech firms say it is needed to protect inventions  while others fear it will hurt smaller tech firms. the ec says the council of ministers will adopt a draft version that was agreed upon last may but said it would review  all aspects of the directive . the directive is intended to offer patent protection to inventions that use software to achieve their effect  in other words   computer implemented invention .  in a letter  ec president jos&#233; manuel barroso told the president of the european parliament  josep borrell  that the commission  did not intend to refer a new proposal to the parliament and the council (of ministers)  as it had supported the agreement reached by ministers in may 2004.  if the european council agrees on the draft directive it will then return for a second reading at the european parliament. but that will not guarantee that the directive will become law - instead it will probably mean further delays and controversy over the directive. most eu legislation now needs the approval of both parliament and the council of ministers before it becomes law. french green mep alain lipietz warned two weeks ago that if the commission ignored the parliament s request it would be an  insult  to the assembly. he said that the parliament would then reject the council s version of the legislation as part of the final or conciliation stage of the decision procedure. in the us  the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted.  this means that the us-based amazon.com holds a patent for its  one-click shopping  service  for example. critics are concerned that the directive could lead to a similar model happening in europe. this  they fear  could hurt small software developers because they do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies if they had to fight patent legal action in court. supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up a playing field without bringing eu laws in line with the us.,redraft eu patent law propos european law softwar patent redraft european commiss ec despit request mep law prove controversi limbo year major tech firm say need protect invent other fear hurt small tech firm ec say council minist adopt draft version agre upon last may say would review aspect direct direct intend offer patent protect invent use softwar achiev effect word comput implement invent letter ec presid jo manuel barroso told presid european parliament josep borrel commiss intend refer new propos parliament council minist support agreement reach minist may european council agre draft direct return second read european parliament guarante direct becom law instead probabl mean delay controversi direct eu legisl need approv parliament council minist becom law french green mep alain lipietz warn two week ago commiss ignor parliament request would insult assembl say parliament would reject council version legisl part final concili stage decis procedur u patent comput program internet busi method permit mean usbas amazoncom hold patent oneclick shop servic exampl critic concern direct could lead similar model happen europ fear could hurt small softwar develop legal financi might large compani fight patent legal action court support say current law ineffici would serv even play field without bring eu law line u

169,1336,musicians  upbeat  about the net musicians are embracing the internet as a way of reaching new fans and selling more music  a survey has found.  the study by us researchers  pew internet  suggests musicians do not agree with the tactics adopted by the music industry against file-sharing. while most considered file-sharing as illegal  many disagreed with the lawsuits launched against downloaders.  even successful artists don t think the lawsuits will benefit musicians   said report author mary madden.  for part of the study  pew internet conducted an online survey of 2 755 musicians  songwriters and music publishers via musician membership organisations between march and april 2004.  they ranged from full-time  successful musicians to artists struggling to make a living from their music.  we looked at more of the independent musicians  rather than the rockstars of this industry but that reflects more accurately the state of the music industry   ms madden told the bbc news website.  we always hear the views of successful artists like the britneys of the world but the less successful artists rarely get represented.  the survey found that musicians were overwhelming positive about the internet  rather than seeing it as just a threat to their livelihood. almost all of them used the net for ideas and inspiration  with nine out of 10 going online to promote  advertise and post their music on the web. more than 80% offered free samples online  while two-thirds sold their music via the net. independent musicians  in particular  saw the internet as a way to get around the need to land a record contract and reach fans directly.  musicians are embracing the internet enthusiastically   said ms madden.  they are using the internet to gain inspiration  sell it online  tracking royalties  learning about copyright.   perhaps surprisingly  opinions about online file-sharing were diverse and not as clear cut as those of the record industry.  through the recording industry association of america (riaa)  it has pursued an aggressive campaign through the courts to sue people suspected of sharing copyrighted music. but the report suggests this campaign does not have the wholehearted backing of musicians in the us. it found that most artists saw file-sharing as both good and bad  though most agreed that it should be illegal.  free downloading has killed opportunities for new bands to break without major funding and backing   said one musician quoted by the report.  it s hard to keep making records if they don t pay for themselves through sales.  however 60% said they did not think the lawsuits against song swappers would benefit musicians and songwriters. many suggested that rather than fighting file-sharing  the music industry needed to recognise the changes it has brought and embrace it.  both successful and struggling musicians were more likely to say that the internet has made it possible for them to make more money from their music  rather than make it harder for them to protect their material from piracy   said ms madden.,musician upbeat net musician embrac internet way reach new fan sell music survey found studi u research pew internet suggest musician agre tactic adopt music industri fileshar consid fileshar illeg mani disagre lawsuit launch download even success artist think lawsuit benefit musician say report author mari madden part studi pew internet conduct onlin survey musician songwrit music publish via musician membership organis march april rang fulltim success musician artist struggl make live music look independ musician rather rockstar industri reflect accur state music industri m madden told bbc news websit alway hear view success artist like britney world less success artist rare get repres survey found musician overwhelm posit internet rather see threat livelihood almost use net idea inspir nine go onlin promot advertis post music web offer free sampl onlin twothird sell music via net independ musician particular saw internet way get around need land record contract reach fan directli musician embrac internet enthusiast say m madden use internet gain inspir sell onlin track royalti learn copyright perhap surprisingli opinion onlin fileshar diver clear cut record industri record industri associ america riaa pursu aggress campaign court sue peopl suspect share copyright music report suggest campaign wholeheart back musician u found artist saw fileshar good bad though agre illeg free download kill opportun new band break without major fund back say one musician quot report hard keep make record pay sale howev say think lawsuit song swapper would benefit musician songwrit mani suggest rather fight fileshar music industri need recognis chang brought embrac success struggl musician like say internet make possibl make money music rather make harder protect materi piraci say m madden
170,1825,howard and blair tax pledge clash tony blair has said voters will have to wait for labour s manifesto to see if the party has plans to increase tax.  the premier was responding to a challenge from tory leader michael howard who said labour would raise taxes in its post-election budget. mr blair derided tory claims they could cut £35bn in  wasteful spending  saying the party had got its sums wrong. the two political leaders clashed just days after the opening salvoes of the pre-election period. mr howard told mps that  every independent expert  from the international monetary fund to the institute of fiscal studies had suggested the  government was spending more than it is raising and a labour chancellor would have to put up taxes . mr blair replied:  i think they are wrong for this very simple reason: that the treasury forecasts on the economy have been proven right.  the tories on monday highlighted their plans for tax cuts worth £4bn  although the specific taxes to be cut have not been announced.  they also spelled out their plans for reduced government borrowing and more spending on key services. labour and the liberal democrats have said the party s sums do not add up and claim it would cut frontline services. but mr howard said voters faced a clear choice at the next election between more waste and more tax under labour and tory value for money and lower taxes. the liberal democrats have also launched their pre-election platform  with leader charles kennedy saying his party was the  authentic opposition   particularly on the iraq war  council tax and university tuition fees. labour hit back at the tory proposals even before their publication with election coordinator alan milburn accusing mr howard of producing a  fraudulent prospectus .,howard blair tax pledg clash toni blair say voter wait labour manifesto see parti plan increas tax premier respond challeng torus leader michael howard say labour would rais tax postelect budget mr blair derid torus claim could cut £bn wast spend say parti get sum wrong two polit leader clash day open salvo preelect period mr howard told mp everi independ expert intern monetari fund institut fiscal studi suggest govern spend rais labour chancellor would put tax mr blair repli think wrong simpl reason treasuri forecast economi proven right torus monday highlight plan tax cut worth £bn although specif tax cut announc also spell plan reduc govern borrow spend key servic labour liber democrat say parti sum add claim would cut frontlin servic mr howard say voter face clear choic next elect wast tax labour torus valu money low tax liber democrat also launch preelect platform leader charl kennedi say parti authent opposit particularli iraq war council tax univers tuition fee labour hit back torus propos even public elect coordin alan milburn accus mr howard produc fraudul prospectu

172,1820,halo fans  hope for sequel xbox video game halo 2 has been released in the us on 9 november  with a uk release two days later. why is the game among the most anticipated of all time   halo is considered by many video game pundits to be one of the finest examples of interactive entertainment ever produced and more than 1.5 million people worldwide have pre-ordered the sequel. a science fiction epic  halo centred the action on a human cyborg  controlled by the player  who had to save his crew from an alien horde after a crash landing on a strange and exotic world contained on the interior surface of a giant ring in space. remembrance of things past it was not - but as a slice of schlock science fiction inspired by works such as larry niven s ringworld and the film starship troopers  it fit the bill perfectly. halo stood out from a crowd of similar titles - it was graphically impressive  had tremendous audio  using dolby digital  a decent storyline  instant playability and impressive physics.  but what marked halo as a classic were the thousands of details which brought a feeling of polish and the enormously-high production values not usually associated with video gaming.  produced by bungie software  renowned for their innovation in gaming  it caused a stir among the gaming fraternity when the developer was bought by microsoft and became an xbox exclusive. claude errera  editor of fansite halo.bungie.org  said:  bungie got everything right. they were really careful to make sure everything worked the way it was supposed to.  nothing distracts you when you were playing. there was nothing in halo that had not been done before but everything in there was as good as it could be.  he added:  graphically it was superior to everything else out there.   it also had a depth to it that made it stand out.  halo was unusually immersive  sucking the player into the action and blurring the interface between screen and controller. it also capitalised on the growing popularity of lan gaming in the pc world - for the first time it became easy to link multiple game consoles together  allowing up to 16 players to battle against each other at the same time.  the game instantly cultivated an online following  which continues today with a score of halo fan websites following every aspect of the sequel  halo 2. errera spends three to fours hours a day of his own time maintaining the hugely popular website  which attracts 600 000 page views a day from halo fans eager for the latest news.  when the xbox launched on november 15 2001 in the us  halo was one of the launch titles and had an immediate impact on critics and consumers.  halo is the most important launch game for any console ever   wrote the influential edge magazine in its review  giving it a rare 10 out of 10 mark. the game had its critics and while it is not a one-off original as a game  it brought many original touches and flourishes to the genre which have defined all other first person shooters since.  the first time i played it i just stood there watching the spent shells fall out of my gun   said errera  remarking on the level of detail in the game.  the game also inspired thousands of people to write their own fiction based on the storyline and produce downloadable video clips of the many weird and wonderful things that can be done in the game.  it blew me away the first time someone managed to climb to the top of halo   said errera  referring to a fan who had created a video of master chief scaling the landscape of the graphical world. video clips of the more outrageous stunts that are possible thanks to the game s amazing physics engine are incredibly popular and some have attained a cult following. speculation about the sequel has seen every titbit analysed and poured over with all the intent of a forensic scientist examining a body. when early screenshots of the game were released some people wrote essay-length articles highlighting everything from the texture of graphics to clues about the story line. errera said expectations of the sequel among fans were sky high.  it does not feel like a game release any more. somebody told me this was the biggest single release of any product in microsoft s history.  we re all just hoping that bungie has got it right again.   halo 2 is out on 9 november in the us and 11 november in the uk,halo fan hope sequel xbox video game halo releas u novemb uk releas two day later game among anticip time halo consid mani video game pundit one fine exampl interact entertain ever produc million peopl worldwid preorder sequel scienc fiction epic halo centr action human cyborg control player save crew alien hord crash land strang exot world contain interior surfac giant ring space remembr thing past slice schlock scienc fiction inspir work larri niven ringworld film starship trooper fit bill perfectli halo stood crowd similar titl graphic impress tremend audio use dolbi digit decent storylin instant playabl impress physic mark halo classic thousand detail brought feel polish enormouslyhigh product valu usual associ video game produc bungi softwar renown innov game caus stir among game fratern develop bought microsoft becam xbox exclus claud errera editor fansit halobungieorg say bungi get everyth right realli care make sure everyth work way suppos noth distract play noth halo do everyth good could ad graphic superior everyth el also depth make stand halo unusu immers suck player action blur interfac screen control also capitalis grow popular lan game pc world first time becam easi link multipl game consol togeth allow player battl time game instantli cultiv onlin follow continu today score halo fan websit follow everi aspect sequel halo errera spend three four hour day time maintain huge popular websit attract page view day halo fan eager late news xbox launch novemb u halo one launch titl immedi impact critic consum halo import launch game consol ever write influenti edg magazin review give rare mark game critic oneoff origin game brought mani origin touch flourish genr defin first person shooter sinc first time play stood watch spent shell fall gun say errera remark level detail game game also inspir thousand peopl write fiction base storylin produc download video clip mani weird wonder thing do game blew away first time someon manag climb top halo say errera refer fan creat video master chief scale landscap graphic world video clip outrag stunt possibl thank game amaz physic engin incred popular attain cult follow specul sequel see everi titbit analys pour intent forens scientist examin bodi earli screenshot game releas peopl write essaylength articl highlight everyth textur graphic clue stori line errera say expect sequel among fan sky high feel like game releas somebodi told big singl releas product microsoft histori hope bungi get right halo novemb u novemb uk

174,1620,mci shares climb on takeover bid shares in us phone company mci have risen on speculation that it is in takeover talks.  the wall street journal reported on thursday that qwest has bid $6.3bn (£3.4bn) for mci. other firms have also expressed an interest in mci  the second-largest us long-distance phone firm  and may now table rival bids  analysts said. shares in mci  which changed its name from worldcom when it emerged from bankruptcy  were up 2.4% at $20.15. press reports suggest that qwest and mci may reach an agreement as early as next week  although rival bids may muddy the waters. the largest us telephone company verizon has previously held preliminary merger discussions with mci  reuters quoted sources as saying.  consolidation in the us telecommunications industry has picked up in the past few months as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases. a merger between mci and qwest would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since october. last week  sbc communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone trailblazer at&t for about $16bn. competition has intensified and fixed-line phone providers such as mci and at&t have seen themselves overtaken by rivals. buying mci would give qwest  a local phone service provider  access to mci s global network and business-based subscribers. mci also offers internet services.  mci was renamed after it emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in april last year. it hit the headlines as worldcom in 2002 after admitting it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits. the scandal was a key factor in a global slide in share prices and the reverberations are still being felt today. shareholders lost about $180bn when the company collapsed  while 20 000 workers lost their jobs. former worldcom boss bernie ebbers is currently on trial  accused of overseeing an $11bn fraud.,mci share climb takeov bid share u phone compani mci risen specul takeov talk wall street journal report thursday qwest bid bn £bn mci firm also express interest mci secondlargest u longdist phone firm may tabl rival bid analyst say share mci chang name worldcom emerg bankruptci press report suggest qwest mci may reach agreement earli next week although rival bid may muddi water large u telephon compani verizon previous held preliminari merger discus mci reuter quot sourc say consolid u telecommun industri pick past month compani look cut cost boost client base merger mci qwest would fifth billiondollar telecom deal sinc octob last week sbc commun agre buy former parent phone trailblaz att bn competit intensifi fixedlin phone provid mci att see overtaken rival buy mci would give qwest local phone servic provid access mci global network businessbas subscrib mci also offer internet servic mci renam emerg chapter bankruptci protect april last year hit headlin worldcom admit illeg book expens inflat profit scandal key factor global slide share price reverber still felt today sharehold lose bn compani collaps worker lose job former worldcom bos berni ebber current trial accus overse bn fraud

179,2002,china continues rapid growth china s economy has expanded by a breakneck 9.5% during 2004  faster than predicted and well above 2003 s 9.1%.  the news may mean more limits on investment and lending as beijing tries to take the economy off the boil. china has sucked in raw materials and energy to feed its expansion  which could have knock-on effects on the rest of the world if it overheats. but officials pointed out that industrial growth had slowed  with services providing much of the impetus. growth in industrial output - the main target of government efforts to impose curbs on credit and investments - was 11.5% in 2004  down from 17% the previous year.  still  consumer prices - at 2.4% - rose faster than in 2004  adding to concern that a sharp rise in producer prices of 7.1% could stoke inflation. and overall investment in fixed assets was still high  up 21.3% from the previous year - although some way off the peak of 43% seen in the first quarter of 2004. the result could be higher interest rates. china raised rates by 0.27 percentage points to 5.8% - its first hike in nine years - in october 2004.  despite the apparent rebalancing of the economy the overall growth picture remains strong  economists said.  there is no sign of a slowdown in 2005   said tim congdon  economist at ing barings.  china s economy is not only gathering speed thanks to domestic demand  but also from soaring sales overseas. figures released earlier this year showed exports at a six-year high in 2004  up 35%. part of the impetus comes from the relative cheapness of the yuan  china s currency. the government keeps it pegged close to a rate of 8.28 to the us dollar  - much to the chagrin of many us lawmakers who blame china for lost jobs and competitiveness. despite urging to ease the peg  officials insist they are a long way from ready to make a shift to a more market-set rate.  we need a good and feasible plan and formulating such a plan also needs time   national bureau of statistics chief li deshui told reuters.  those who hope to make a fortune by speculating on a renminbi revaluation will not succeed in making a profit.,china continu rapid growth china economi expand breakneck faster predict well news may mean limit invest lend beij tri take economi boil china suck raw materi energi feed expans could knockon effect rest world overheat offici point industri growth slow servic provid much impetu growth industri output main target govern effort impos curb credit invest previou year still consum price rise faster ad concern sharp rise produc price could stoke inflat overal invest fix asset still high previou year although way peak see first quarter result could high interest rate china rais rate percentag point first hike nine year octob despit appar rebalanc economi overal growth pictur remain strong economist say sign slowdown say tim congdon economist ing bare china economi gather speed thank domest demand also soar sale oversea figur releas earlier year show export sixyear high part impetu come rel cheap yuan china currenc govern keep peg close rate u dollar much chagrin mani u lawmak blame china lose job competit despit urg ea peg offici insist long way readi make shift marketset rate need good feasibl plan formul plan also need time nation bureau statist chief li deshui told reuter hope make fortun specul renminbi revalu succeed make profit

181,1602,castaignede fires laporte warning former france fly-half thomas castaignede has warned the pressure is mounting on coach bernard laporte following their defeat by wales.  france suffered a shock loss against the welsh at the weekend after looking on course for an easy win. castaignede told bbc sport:  the pressure is big on laporte after a huge loss to new zealand  a slim win over scotland and a miracle against england.  but the french have to get behind him and the team at lansdowne road.  following victories over south africa and australia in november  france were deemed by many to be the world s leading side. but they were then trounced 45-6 by new zealand and only just beat scotland after the scots had a try disallowed in their six nations opener. it then took some woeful spot kicking from charlie hodgson and olly barkley to help them to victory against england at twickenham. &lt;  castaignede said:  you can t say any of those results have eased the pressure on laporte.  had england s kickers not been so bad  the position in the six nations would be very different now.  laporte has been criticised for france s negative tactics in their wins over scotland and england. but his side played a more free-flowing style against wales  making a mockery of the opposition s defence in the first half before suffering a shock turnaround in fortunes after the interval.  all the chat in france has been about how france will play against ireland   said castaignede ahead of the 12 march tie.  everyone wants to see the sort of play we saw against wales. but everyone also wants a win.  castaignede  a veteran of 43 international caps  admitted the french would go in as underdogs against ireland.   going to ireland is never easy but the way they re playing right now  it s harder than ever   said castaignede.  they re very experienced and don t often lose at home. they ve got some great forwards and some electric runners on the break.  despite praising the irish he claimed the welsh had the upper hand in the six nations run-in.  ireland have such a good pack but wales are something else on the break   he added.  at the weekend they were simply awesome. as a frenchman it was disappointing to see  but you had to admire it.  their commitment to every cause can make them win this championship.  the 30-year-old also tipped yann delaigue to start ahead of frederic michalak at number 10 after an impressive display in paris last weekend.  delaigue played really well and admittedly michalak played well too   said castaignede.  i m just glad i m not the one who has to make the decision.,castaigned fire laport warn former franc flyhalf thoma castaigned warn pressur mount coach bernard laport follow defeat wale franc suffer shock loss welsh weekend look cours easi win castaigned told bbc sport pressur big laport huge loss new zealand slim win scotland miracl england french get behind team lansdown road follow victori south africa australia novemb franc deem mani world lead side trounc new zealand beat scotland scot tri disallow six nation open take woeful spot kick charli hodgson olli barkley help victori england twickenham lt castaigned say say result ea pressur laport england kicker bad posit six nation would differ laport criticis franc neg tactic win scotland england side play freeflow style wale make mockeri opposit defenc first half suffer shock turnaround fortun interv chat franc franc play ireland say castaigned ahead march tie everyon want see sort play saw wale everyon also want win castaigned veteran intern cap admit french would go underdog ireland go ireland never easi way play right harder ever say castaigned experienc often lose home get great forward electr runner break despit prais irish claim welsh upper hand six nation runin ireland good pack wale someth el break ad weekend simpli awesom frenchman disappoint see admir commit everi caus make win championship yearold also tip yann delaigu start ahead freder michalak number impress display pari last weekend delaigu play realli well admittedli michalak play well say castaigned glad one make decis
182,993,concern over rfid tags consumers are very concerned about the use of radio frequency id (rfid) tags in shops  a survey says.  more than half of 2 000 people surveyed said they had privacy worries about the tags  which can be used to monitor stock on shelves or in warehouses. some consumer groups have expressed concern that the tags could be used to monitor shoppers once they had left shops with their purchases. the survey showed that awareness of tags among consumers in europe was low. the survey of consumers in the uk  france  germany and the netherlands was carried out by consultancy group capgemini. the firm works on behalf of more than 30 firms who are seeking to promote the growth of rfid technology. the tags are a combination of computer chip and antenna which can be read by a scanner - each item contains a unique identification number.  more than half (55%) of the respondents said they were either concerned or very concerned that rfid tags would allow businesses to track consumers via product purchases. fifty nine percent of people said they were worried that rfid tags would allow data to be used more freely by third parties. ard jan vetham  capgemini s principal consultant on rfid  said the survey showed that retailers needed to inform and educate people about rfid before it would become accepted technology.  acceptance of new technologies always has a tipping point at which consumers believe that benefits outweigh concerns.  with the right rfid approach and ongoing communication with consumers  the industry can reach this point.  he said that the survey also showed people would accept rfid if they felt that the technology could mean a reduction in car theft or faster recovery of stolen items. the tags are currently being used at one tesco distribution centre in the uk - the tags allow the rapid inventory of bulk items. they are also in use as a passcard for the m6 toll in the midlands  in the uk. mr vetham said the majority of people surveyed (52%) believed that rfid tags could be read from a distance. he said that was a misconception based on a lack of awareness of the technology. at least once consumer group - consumers against supermarket privacy invasion and numbering (caspian) - has claimed that rfid chips could be used to secretly identify people and the things they are carrying or wearing. all kinds of personal belongings  including clothes  could constantly broadcast messages about their whereabouts and their owners  it warned.,concern rfid tag consum concern use radio frequenc id rfid tag shop survey say half peopl survey say privaci worri tag use monitor stock shelv warehous consum group express concern tag could use monitor shopper left shop purchas survey show awar tag among consum europ low survey consum uk franc germani netherland carri consult group capgemini firm work behalf firm seek promot growth rfid technolog tag combin comput chip antenna read scanner item contain uniqu identif number half respond say either concern concern rfid tag would allow busi track consum via product purchas fifti nine percent peopl say worri rfid tag would allow data use freeli third parti ard jan vetham capgemini princip consult rfid say survey show retail need inform educ peopl rfid would becom accept technolog accept new technolog alway tip point consum believ benefit outweigh concern right rfid approach ongo commun consum industri reach point say survey also show peopl would accept rfid felt technolog could mean reduct car theft faster recoveri steal item tag current use one tesco distribut centr uk tag allow rapid inventori bulk item also use passcard m toll midland uk mr vetham say major peopl survey believ rfid tag could read distanc say misconcept base lack awar technolog least consum group consum supermarket privaci invas number caspian claim rfid chip could use secretli identifi peopl thing carri wear kind person belong includ cloth could constantli broadcast messag whereabout owner warn

185,2023,us data sparks inflation worries wholesale prices in the us rose at the fastest rate in more than six years in january  according to government data.  new figures show the labor department producer price index (ppi) rose by 0.3% - in line with forecasts. but core producer prices  which exclude food and energy costs  surged by 0.8%  the biggest rise since december 1998  increasing inflationary concerns. in contrast  the university of michigan barometer of us retail consumer confidence showed a slight dip. the university s index of consumer spending fell to 94.2 in early february from 95.5 in january  which could indicate a fall in retail spending by the us public. the mixed set of data on friday led to volatile early wall street trade  as the dow jones  standard and poor s 500  and nasdaq swung between positive and negative territory.  the economic figures come on the back of increased fears that the federal reserve chairman may be about to raise interest rates in order to stifle any inflationary pressures. the fed has been raising interest rates at a gradual pace since june 2004  in an attempt to make sure inflation does not get out of control.  mr greenspan told congress this week that the central bank was on guard against the possibility that a rebounding economy could trigger stronger inflation pressures.  the ppi would argue for greenspan to continue to raise rates at a measured pace   said joe quinlan  chief market stategist at bank of america capital management.  but this michigan survey tells you that the consumer might be downshifting a little bit in terms of their confidence and their spending; this could be an indication of that.   consumer spending accounts for 66% of us economic activity and is viewed as a gauge of the health of the economy  which is why the michigan data is closely observed. however on friday  it was overshadowed by the core ppi core figure  which surged 2.7% during the past 12 months  the biggest year-on-year gain in nine years.  the concern is that traders might interpret this big jump in the core ppi as an impetus for the fed to be more aggressive than a measured move in moving rates   said paul cherney  chief market analyst at standard & poor s. but ian shepherdson  chief us economist at high frequency economics  said the ppi report was  much less alarming  than at first glance. one-time increases in alcohol and tobacco prices  which  are no indication of broad ppi pressure   were responsible for the increase  he said. prices for autos and trucks also jumped in january  but shepherdson said  it is a good bet these increases won t stick .,u data spark inflat worri wholesal price u rise fast rate six year januari accord govern data new figur show labor depart produc price index ppi rise line forecast core produc price exclud food energi cost surg big rise sinc decemb increas inflationari concern contrast univers michigan baromet u retail consum confid show slight dip univers index consum spend fell earli februari januari could indic fall retail spend u public mix set data friday lead volatil earli wall street trade dow jone standard poor nasdaq swung posit neg territori econom figur come back increas fear feder reserv chairman may rais interest rate order stifl inflationari pressur fed rais interest rate gradual pace sinc june attempt make sure inflat get control mr greenspan told congress week central bank guard possibl rebound economi could trigger strong inflat pressur ppi would argu greenspan continu rais rate measur pace say joe quinlan chief market stategist bank america capit manag michigan survey tell consum might downshift littl bit term confid spend could indic consum spend account u econom activ view gaug health economi michigan data close observ howev friday overshadow core ppi core figur surg past month big yearonyear gain nine year concern trader might interpret big jump core ppi impetu fed aggress measur move move rate say paul cherney chief market analyst standard poor ian shepherdson chief u economist high frequenc econom say ppi report much less alarm first glanc onetim increas alcohol tobacco price indic broad ppi pressur respons increas say price auto truck also jump januari shepherdson say good bet increas stick
186,143,apple mac mini gets warm welcome the mac mini has been welcomed by apple fans  industry experts and pc users.  the release of the tiny  low-cost machine is seen as a good move for apple which currently has a small share of the desktop computer market. mac watchers and some analysts say the mac mini will go a long way to help apple appeal to the mass of consumers. they speculate that the mac mini will be bought by ipod owners and those wanting an easy-to-use and administer second home computer.   it s the bravest move they have made yet   said jonny evans  news editor at macworld magazine. mr evans said the combination of low cost  small size and huge numbers of ipod users could make it a big success.  he thought that the machine would appeal to those that like apple technology but who before now have balked at paying high prices for its hardware.  it s deeply affordable   he said.  plus you know that you do not get viruses or all of the associated problems.  already  he said  pc owning friends had declared that they would be buying one. interest in the new products launched at macworld expo was so strong that websites for apple s store and the show struggled to cope with demand. according to response statistics gathered by netcraft many visiting the apple store in the wake of mr jobs  speech suffered lengthy response times. the macworld expo site was completely overwhelmed and went offline.   i think fundamentally it s a good idea because it s cheap even for a pc   said nick ross  deputy labs editor at pc pro. apple s work on making things easy to use would also help the mac mini win fans  he said.  i think people expect it just to work now and really it should   hesaid. the mac mini could find a role in homes that need a second computer that is easy to install and administer  he said.  for browsing the web  e-mail and all kinds of basic duties it s going to be absolutely adequate   said mr ross. ian fogg  broadband and personal technology analyst at jupiter research  agreed that the mac mini could be very popular.  apple has been hoping that sales of the ipod will have a halo effect on the sales of the mac   he said.  before now  he said  apple has been seen as a premium brand. but  he said  the mac mini changed that perception.  it s a particularly good price when you see that it s apple that is doing it   he said. apple expects the mac mini to sell for £339 in the uk and $499 in the us. adding extras such as a larger hard drive  more memory and networking options will increase the basic price. it will go on sale from 22 january.  for consumers interested in style  design and small size - which is what the majority of ipod customers are interested in - it s a natural next step   said mr fogg. apple has traditionally done well in the market that the mac mini is aimed at  said mr fogg  who also expected many pc makers to release copycat devices in reaction.  his only misgivings were over how easy other consumers  other than ipod owners  would find using the machine. he said anyone wanting to use the mac mini with the peripherals from an old computer may find it odd to have something so small and sleek next to a hulking monitor.  they d be much more likely to pair a mac mini with a lcd or flat panel monitor which increases the upgrade cost   he said. those with flat screens and lcd monitors are likely to have bought them recently and not be in the market for a new machine.  there are also questions over whether the mac mini will work with very old peripherals  such as display  keyboard and mouse. the mac mini also fell short of being a media server that can be a video recorder as well as a store for all the digital music  movies and images people accumulate  said mr fogg.  the mac mini is not quite ready for that yet   he said.  it does not have the right connectors that fit a tv screen or enough storage.  said mr fogg:  it s very much a computer.  one dissenting opinion came from brian gammage  vice-president of research at analysts gartner. he said:  i don t think it changes the world.  although the mac mini was very cheap for an apple computer  it was still expensive compared to many pcs. also  he said  it appealed in categories that few consumers care about when buying a home computer.  the pc world is a pile-em-high  sell-em-cheap market   he said   and all of them are pretty interchangeable.   since the days when apple ruled the personal computing world its market share has been on a long  slow decline   he said.  every few years it does something to give its market share a kick then it starts to go back down again   said mr gammage. the release of the mac mini fit perfectly with this trend  he said.,appl mac mini get warm welcom mac mini welcom appl fan industri expert pc user releas tini lowcost machin see good move appl current small share desktop comput market mac watcher analyst say mac mini go long way help appl appeal mass consum specul mac mini bought ipod owner want easytous administ second home comput bravest move make yet say jonni evan news editor macworld magazin mr evan say combin low cost small size huge number ipod user could make big success thought machin would appeal like appl technolog balk pay high price hardwar deepli afford say plu know get virus associ problem alreadi say pc own friend declar would buy one interest new product launch macworld expo strong websit appl store show struggl cope demand accord respons statist gather netcraft mani visit appl store wake mr job speech suffer lengthi respons time macworld expo site complet overwhelm go offlin think fundament good idea cheap even pc say nick ross deputi lab editor pc pro appl work make thing easi use would also help mac mini win fan say think peopl expect work realli hesaid mac mini could find role home need second comput easi instal administ say brow web email kind basic duti go absolut adequ say mr ross ian fogg broadband person technolog analyst jupit research agre mac mini could popular appl hope sale ipod halo effect sale mac say say appl see premium brand say mac mini chang percept particularli good price see appl say appl expect mac mini sell £ uk u ad extra large hard drive memori network option increas basic price go sale januari consum interest style design small size major ipod custom interest natur next step say mr fogg appl tradit do well market mac mini aim say mr fogg also expect mani pc maker releas copycat devic reaction misgiv easi consum ipod owner would find use machin say anyon want use mac mini peripher old comput may find odd someth small sleek next hulk monitor much like pair mac mini lcd flat panel monitor increas upgrad cost say flat screen lcd monitor like bought recent market new machin also question whether mac mini work old peripher display keyboard mous mac mini also fell short medium server video record well store digit music movi imag peopl accumul say mr fogg mac mini quit readi yet say right connector fit tv screen enough storag say mr fogg much comput one dissent opinion come brian gammag vicepresid research analyst gartner say think chang world although mac mini cheap appl comput still expens compar mani pc also say appeal categori consum care buy home comput pc world pileemhigh sellemcheap market say pretti interchang sinc day appl rule person comput world market share long slow declin say everi year someth give market share kick start go back say mr gammag releas mac mini fit perfectli trend say
187,548,ink helps drive democracy in asia the kyrgyz republic  a small  mountainous state of the former soviet republic  is using invisible ink and ultraviolet readers in the country s elections as part of a drive to prevent multiple voting.  this new technology is causing both worries and guarded optimism among different sectors of the population. in an effort to live up to its reputation in the 1990s as  an island of democracy   the kyrgyz president  askar akaev  pushed through the law requiring the use of ink during the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections. the us government agreed to fund all expenses associated with this decision.  the kyrgyz republic is seen by many experts as backsliding from the high point it reached in the mid-1990s with a hastily pushed through referendum in 2003  reducing the legislative branch to one chamber with 75 deputies. the use of ink is only one part of a general effort to show commitment towards more open elections - the german embassy  the soros foundation and the kyrgyz government have all contributed to purchase transparent ballot boxes.  the actual technology behind the ink is not that complicated. the ink is sprayed on a person s left thumb. it dries and is not visible under normal light.  however  the presence of ultraviolet light (of the kind used to verify money) causes the ink to glow with a neon yellow light. at the entrance to each polling station  one election official will scan voter s fingers with uv lamp before allowing them to enter  and every voter will have his/her left thumb sprayed with ink before receiving the ballot. if the ink shows under the uv light the voter will not be allowed to enter the polling station. likewise  any voter who refuses to be inked will not receive the ballot. these elections are assuming even greater significance because of two large factors - the upcoming parliamentary elections are a prelude to a potentially regime changing presidential election in the autumn as well as the echo of recent elections in other former soviet republics  notably ukraine and georgia. the use of ink has been controversial - especially among groups perceived to be pro-government.  widely circulated articles compared the use of ink to the rural practice of marking sheep - a still common metaphor in this primarily agricultural society.  the author of one such article began a petition drive against the use of the ink. the greatest part of the opposition to ink has often been sheer ignorance. local newspapers have carried stories that the ink is harmful  radioactive or even that the ultraviolet readers may cause health problems. others  such as the aggressively middle of the road  coalition of non-governmental organizations  have lauded the move as an important step forward. this type of ink has been used in many elections in the world  in countries as varied as serbia  south africa  indonesia and turkey. the other common type of ink in elections is indelible visible ink - but as the elections in afghanistan showed  improper use of this type of ink can cause additional problems. the use of  invisible  ink is not without its own problems. in most elections  numerous rumors have spread about it.  in serbia  for example  both christian and islamic leaders assured their populations that its use was not contrary to religion. other rumours are associated with how to remove the ink -

190,1424,robben and cole earn chelsea win cheslea salvaged a win against a battling portsmouth side just as it looked like the premiership leaders would have to settle for a point.  arjen robben curled in a late deflected left-footed shot from the right side of pompey s box to break the home side s brave resistance. chelsea had been continually frustrated but joe cole added a second with a 20-yard shot in injury-time. nigel quashie had pompey s best chance when his effort was tipped over. the fratton park crowd were in good voice as usual and  even though portsmouth more than held their own  chelsea still managed to carve out two early chances. striker didier drogba snapped in an angled shot to force home keeper shaka hislop into a smart save while an unmarked frank lampard had a strike blocked by arjan de zeeuw. but pompey chased  harried and unsettled a chelsea side as the south-coast side started to gain the upper hand and almost took the lead through quashie.  the midfielder struck a swerving long range shot which keeper petr cech tipped over at full stretch. pompey stretched arsenal to the limit recently and were providing a similarly tough obstacle to overcome for a chelsea team struggling to exert any pressure. velimir zajec s players stood firm as the visitors came out in lively fashion after the break but  just as they took a stranglehold of the match  the visitors launched a counter-attack. drogba spun to get a sight of goal and struck a fierce shot which rocked keeper hislop back as he blocked before arjan de zeeuw cleared the danger.  the home side were also left breathing a sigh of relief when a glen johnson header fell to gudjohnsen who had his back to goal in a crowded pompey goalmouth. the icelandic forward tried to acrobatically direct the ball into goal but put his effort over. but  just like against arsenal  portsmouth let in a late goal when robben s shot took a deflection off matthew taylor on its way past a wrong-footed hislop. and cole put a bit of gloss on a hard-fought win when he put a low shot into the bottom of the pompey net.  hislop  griffin  primus  de zeeuw  taylor  stone (cisse 76)  quashie (berkovic 83)  faye  o neil  kamara (fuller 65)  yakubu.  subs not used: berger  ashdown.  kamara.  cech  paulo ferreira  gallas  terry  johnson  duff  makelele  smertin (cole 73)  lampard  robben (geremi 81)  drogba (gudjohnsen 58).  subs not used: cudicini  bridge.  paulo ferreira  robben  lampard.  robben 79  cole 90.  20 210  a wiley (staffordshire).,robben cole earn chelsea win cheslea salvag win battl portsmouth side look like premiership leader would settl point arjen robben curl late deflect leftfoot shot right side pompey box break home side brave resist chelsea continu frustrat joe cole ad second yard shot injurytim nigel quashi pompey best chanc effort tip fratton park crowd good voic usual even though portsmouth held chelsea still manag carv two earli chanc striker didier drogba snap angl shot forc home keeper shaka hislop smart save unmark frank lampard strike block arjan de zeeuw pompey chase harri unsettl chelsea side southcoast side start gain upper hand almost take lead quashi midfield struck swerv long rang shot keeper petr cech tip full stretch pompey stretch arsen limit recent provid similarli tough obstacl overcom chelsea team struggl exert pressur velimir zajec player stood firm visitor come live fashion break take stranglehold match visitor launch counterattack drogba spun get sight goal struck fierc shot rock keeper hislop back block arjan de zeeuw clear danger home side also left breath sigh relief glen johnson header fell gudjohnsen back goal crowd pompey goalmouth iceland forward tri acrobat direct ball goal put effort like arsen portsmouth let late goal robben shot take deflect matthew taylor way past wrongfoot hislop cole put bit gloss hardfought win put low shot bottom pompey net hislop griffin primu de zeeuw taylor stone cis quashi berkov fay neil kamara fuller yakubu sub use berger ashdown kamara cech paulo ferreira galla terri johnson duff makelel smertin cole lampard robben geremi drogba gudjohnsen sub use cudicini bridg paulo ferreira robben lampard robben cole wiley staffordshir

192,920,eu referendum could cost £80m  it could cost £80m to run a uk referendum on the european constitution  ministers have revealed.  in a written parliamentary answer  constitutional affairs minister chris leslie said the poll was likely to cost the same as a general election. mr leslie said the cost could not be compared with the only previous british referendum  held 30 years ago. ministers say the constitution would make the european union work better but critics fear creating a  super state . labour mp john cryer  whose question revealed the price estimate  said the cost surprised him but was not a central factor as it was important people had their say. but he said it would have been better to have rejected the constitution so avoiding the need for a referendum. the 2001 election cost £80m. no date for the vote has been set but foreign secretary jack straw has suggested it is unlikely to be held until early 2006 - after the predicted date for the next election. most voters said the uk should stay in the common market in the 1975 referendum.,eu referendum could cost £m could cost £m run uk referendum european constitut minist reveal write parliamentari answer constitut affair minist chri lesli say poll like cost gener elect mr lesli say cost could compar previou british referendum held year ago minist say constitut would make european union work well critic fear creat super state labour mp john cryer whose question reveal price estim say cost surpris central factor import peopl say say would well reject constitut avoid need referendum elect cost £m date vote set foreign secretari jack straw suggest unlik held earli predict date next elect voter say uk stay common market referendum
193,1553,attack prompts bush site block the official re-election site of president george w bush is blocking visits from overseas users for  security reasons .  the blocking began early on monday so those outside the us and trying to view the site got a message saying they are not authorised to view it. but keen net users have shown that the policy is not being very effective. many have found that the site can still be viewed by overseas browsers via several alternative net addresses.  the policy of trying to stop overseas visitors viewing the site is thought to have been adopted in response to an attack on the georgewbush.com website. scott stanzel  a spokesman for the bush-cheney campaign said:  the measure was taken for security reasons.  he declined to elaborate any further on the blocking policy. the barring of non-us visitors has led to the campaign being inundated with calls and forced it to make a statement about why the blocking was taking place. in early october a so-called  denial of service  attack was mounted on the site that bombarded it with data from thousands of pcs. the attack made the site unusable for about five hours.  about the same time the web team of the bush-cheney campaign started using the services of a company called akamai that helps websites deal with the ebbs and flows of visitor traffic. akamai uses a web-based tool called edgescape that lets its customers work out where visitors are based. typically this tool is used to ensure that webpages  video and images load quickly but it can also be used to block traffic. geographic blocking works because the numerical addresses that the net uses to organise itself are handed out on a regional basis. readers of the boingboing weblog have found that viewers can still get at the site by using alternative forms of the george w bush domain name. ironically one of the working alternatives is for a supposedly more secure version of the site. there are now at least three working alternative domains for the bush-cheney campaign that let web users outside the us visit the site. the site can also be seen using anonymous proxy services that are based in the us. some web users in canada also report that they can browse the site.  the international exclusion zone around georgewbush.com was spotted by net monitoring firm netcraft which keeps an eye on traffic patterns across many different sites.  netcraft said that since the early hours of 25 october attempts to view the site through its monitoring stations in london  amsterdam and sydney have failed. by contrast netcraft s four monitoring stations in the us managed to view the site with no problems. data gathered by netcraft on the pattern of traffic to the site shows that the blocking is not the result of another denial of service attack. mike prettejohn  netcraft president  speculated that the blocking decision might have been taken to cut costs  and traffic  in the run-up to the election on 2 november. he said the site may see no reason to distribute content to people who will not be voting next week. managing traffic could also be a good way to ensure that the site stays working in the closing days of the election campaign. however  simply blocking non-us visitors also means that americans overseas are barred too. most american soldiers stationed overseas will be able to see the site as they use the us military s own portion of the net. akamai declined to comment  saying it could not talk about customer websites.,attack prompt bush site block offici reelect site presid georg

196,2006,police urge pub closure power new powers are needed to close disorderly pubs  bars and clubs for up to a week or even permanently  police chiefs have told mps.  association of chief police officers president chris fox said the current 24-hour closure power did not have enough impact on bad landlords. mr fox s comments follow the controversy over plans to allow pubs to open around the clock. he rejected critics  calls for the law change to be delayed. instead  the new licensing act could help reduce drunken disorder - but only if it was properly planned  he argued.  acpo made its call for stronger closure powers in a paper for the commons home affairs select committee. after the meeting  mr fox said being able to close premises for only 24 hours did not necessarily make an impact.  if it s 12.30 on a saturday morning and you close for 24 hours there s not a lot of pain for the premises because they probably wouldn t open on sunday anyway.   this is about getting through to the management that they can t run a disorderly house without facing some immediate sanctions.  under acpo s proposal  the closure orders would be used only with the agreement of the local licensing authority. the new licensing laws will give police greater powers to close pubs and clubs - but only for 24-hour periods.  mr fox said the drinks industry was currently not regulating itself.  it s making money at the cost of human misery and the public purse  and the strategic planning process has been less than useless   he said. mr fox said the new laws  due to start being phased in next month  could help if food outlets  public transport and public toilets could cope with late-night drinkers.  staggering it (closing hours) will be a solution if the infrastructure is there  if the premises are properly managed and people aren t being served rolling drunk and underage and then tossed out into the street   he said.  we have the problem from 11pm to 2am in any event. we have to get a grip on the underlying causes of this.   acpo wants pubs and clubs which cause extra work for police and hospitals to have to pay towards the costs. home secretary charles clarke is currently looking at the idea of a levy on the drinks industry to pay for the cost of extra policing. the licensing changes have sparked concern among some mps  councils and some senior police officers who fear they could exacerbate drinking problems. culture secretary tessa jowell on tuesday said it was not her job to bow to the campaign against the changes. it was the status quo  not the new laws  which were causing current binge drinking problems  she told bbc two s newsnight. leaked documents have suggested ex-home secretary david blunkett branded new opening hours as a  leap in the dark . but ms jowell insisted his concerns had been met. the police s job against alcohol-related crime would be made easier if all pubs did not close at the same time  she added.,polic urg pub closur power new power need close disorderli pub bar club week even perman polic chief told mp associ chief polic offic presid chri fox say current hour closur power enough impact bad landlord mr fox comment follow controversi plan allow pub open around clock reject critic call law chang delay instead new licens act could help reduc drunken disord properli plan argu acpo make call strong closur power paper common home affair select committe meet mr fox say abl close premis hour necessarili make impact saturday morn close hour lot pain premis probabl open sunday anyway get manag run disorderli hous without face immedi sanction acpo propos closur order would use agreement local licens author new licens law give polic great power close pub club hour period mr fox say drink industri current regul make money cost human miseri public purs strateg plan process less useless say mr fox say new law due start phase next month could help food outlet public transport public toilet could cope latenight drinker stagger close hour solut infrastructur premis properli manag peopl serv roll drunk underag toss street say problem pm be event get grip underli caus acpo want pub club caus extra work polic hospit pay toward cost home secretari charl clark current look idea levi drink industri pay cost extra polic licens chang spark concern among mp council senior polic offic fear could exacerb drink problem cultur secretari tessa jowel tuesday say job bow campaign chang statu quo new law caus current bing drink problem told bbc two newsnight leak document suggest exhom secretari david blunkett brand new open hour leap dark m jowel insist concern met polic job alcoholrel crime would make easy pub close time ad
197,307,young debut cut short by ginepri fifteen-year-old donald young s first appearance in an atp tennis tournament proved brief as the teenager went out in round one of the san jose open.  young shot to the top of the junior world rankings when he won the boys  singles at january s australian open. but the wildcard entry was dispatched by fellow american robby ginepri in straight sets  6-2 6-2  in california. despite that he was happy with his tour debut.  it was fun. i had my chances  but they didn t come through   he said. young  who beat two players ranked in the top 200 when he was just 14  was only 2-1 down in the first set before losing 10 of the next 13 games. and ginepri - six years older than the youngest player to ever win a junior slam and top the global standings - admitted he was impressed.   he s very talented   said ginepri.  he s got a long future ahead of him.  being left-handed  he was very quick around the court.  his serve is a little deceptive. he came into the net and volleyed better than i thought.  earlier  south korean hyung-taik lee defeated american jan-michael gambill 6-3 7-6 (7-4). american kevin kim defeated jan hernych of the czech republic 7-5 6-3  canadian qualifier frank dancevic downed american jeff morrison 4-6 7-6 (7-3) 6-0  and denmark s kenneth carlsen beat irakli labadze of the republic of georgia 6-7 (4-7) 6-2 6-3. top seed andy roddick launches his defence of the title on wednesday against qualifier paul goldstein. second seed andre agassi opens his campaign on tuesday against wildcard bobby reynolds  last year s us collegiate champion. agassi has won the san jose five times  but his run of three straight titles ended last year when he fell to mardy fish in the semi-finals. fish went on to lose to roddick in the final.,young debut cut short ginepri fifteenyearold donald young first appear atp tenni tournament prove brief teenag go round one san jose open young shot top junior world rank boy singl januari australian open wildcard entri dispatch fellow american robbi ginepri straight set california despit happi tour debut fun chanc come say young beat two player rank top first set lose next game ginepri six year old young player ever win junior slam top global stand admit impress talent say ginepri get long futur ahead lefthand quick around court serv littl decept come net volley well thought earlier south korean hyungtaik lee defeat american janmichael gambil american kevin kim defeat jan hernych czech republ canadian qualifi frank dancev down american jeff morrison denmark kenneth carlsen beat irakli labadz republ georgia top seed andi roddick launch defenc titl wednesday qualifi paul goldstein second seed andr agassi open campaign tuesday wildcard bobbi reynold last year u collegi champion agassi san jose five time run three straight titl end last year fell mardi fish semifin fish go lose roddick final
198,1906,murphy: that was a bruising battle that s what i call a tough game. it was very physical and fair play to the italians they made us work very hard for our victory.  their organisation was very  very good and they proved again that they are getting better and better as the years go by. it is by far the strongest italian team that we have faced. we knew all along that we would be a huge threat particularly the first game in the championship. it was not like the days gone by when you could get scores on the board early. we had to work our socks off and try and build our scores gradually. it was really hard work out there and the players have plenty of bumps and bruises to prove it. i m not too bad  but there are one or two others who will be feeling it a bit on monday morning. in the backs  we were not frustrated at such  but the new rucking laws were a little bit problematical. the different interpretations between the referee and the players was a little difficult. but we managed to get the ball in our hands and i got a try near the end of the first half. it s always good to score. it was great work by brian and i always knew i had scored even though it went upstairs to the video referee. eddie (o sullivan) was very calm at half-time even though we were only 8-6 ahead. he spelled out what we needed to do and advocated getting the ball out of our own territory.  that new ruck law made it a bit more difficult to get out of our own half. we were penalised a lot at the breakdown  and if they had kicked all their chances at goal we would have been behind at the break. so really we went back to playing a territory game and simplifying things and having more patience on the ball. every one was a little down after the game following the injuries to brian and gordon. as yet we do not know the full extent of the injuries  but it does not that good. now we have to focus on scotland and only six days to recover. it s a big ask after such a bruising encounter. i was very impressed the way the scots played against the french on saturday. it could so easily have gone their way but for a couple of decisions. we will be under no illusions it is going to be tough for us. in the meantime  when in rome ... .,murphi bruis battl call tough game physic fair play italian make u work hard victori organis good prove get well well year go far strong italian team face knew along would huge threat particularli first game championship like day go could get score board earli work sock tri build score gradual realli hard work player plenti bump bruis prove bad one two other feel bit monday morn back frustrat new ruck law littl bit problemat differ interpret refere player littl difficult manag get ball hand get tri near end first half alway good score great work brian alway knew score even though go upstair video refere eddi sullivan calm halftim even though ahead spell need advoc get ball territori new ruck law make bit difficult get half penalis lot breakdown kick chanc goal would behind break realli go back play territori game simplifi thing patienc ball everi one littl game follow injuri brian gordon yet know full extent injuri good focu scotland six day recov big ask bruis encount impress way scot play french saturday could easili go way coupl decis illus go tough u meantim rome
199,1251,turkey-iran mobile deal  at risk  turkey s investment in iran s mobile industry looks set to be scrapped after its biggest mobile firm saw its investment there slashed by mps.  iran s parliament voted by a large majority to cut turkcell s stake in a new mobile network from 70% to 49%. the move  which was justified on national security grounds  follows an earlier vote by mps to give themselves a veto over foreign investments. turkcell said the decision  increases the risks  attached to the project. although the company s statement said it would continue to monitor developments  observers said they thought turkcell was set to pull out of the $3bn deal.  the possibility of carrying out this project is next to zero   said atinc ozkan  analyst at finans investment in istanbul. if turkcell does back out  mtn - the south african firm which lost out in the original tender - may well be back in the running. the company has said it is prepared to accept a minority stake if iran will award it the mobile deal.  turkcell s mobile deal is the second turkish investment in iran to run into trouble. turkish-austrian consortium tav was chosen to build and run tehran s new imam khomeini international airport - but the army closed it just hours after it opened in may 2004. in both cases  the justification has been national security  amid allegations that the turkish firms are too close to israel. the hardline posture taken by parliament  which is dominated by religious conservatives  could yet impact other inward investments.,turkeyiran mobil deal risk turkey invest iran mobil industri look set scrap big mobil firm saw invest slash mp iran parliament vote larg major cut turkcel stake new mobil network move justifi nation secur ground follow earlier vote mp give veto foreign invest turkcel say decis increas risk attach project although compani statement say would continu monitor develop observ say thought turkcel set pull bn deal possibl carri project next zero say atinc ozkan analyst finan invest istanbul turkcel back mtn south african firm lose origin tender may well back run compani say prepar accept minor stake iran award mobil deal turkcel mobil deal second turkish invest iran run troubl turkishaustrian consortium tav chosen build run tehran new imam khomeini intern airport armi close hour open may case justif nation secur amid alleg turkish firm close israel hardlin postur take parliament domin religi conserv could yet impact inward invest

204,1276,could yukos be a blessing in disguise  other things being equal  the notion of entrepreneurs languishing in jail while their companies are sold off for a song ought to be bad for business.  but in the looking-glass world of modern russia  the opposite might just be true  a new report* has argued. the study  from the centre for economic policy research  does not praise the rough handling of oil company yukos. but it argues that more rigorous tax policing has benefited all russian firms  even targets of the tax police.  an increase in tax enforcement can increase the amount [of dividends and other income] outside shareholders will receive  even accounting for increased levels of taxation   the authors say.  the paper s reasoning is complex  and is based on a sophisticated model of the relationship between tax regimes and corporate governance - in particular  the propensity of management to steal from the company. the calculations demonstrated what many russian analysts already knew: that increasing the tax rate increases the amount that managers steal  since undeclared income becomes relatively more valuable. in the west  meanwhile  higher tax rates translate far more smoothly into higher government revenues. on the other hand  increasing the rigour with which taxes are collected encourages companies to become more transparent  forcing them to be able to demonstrate their financial position far more accurately. the net result  the authors say  is that the extra amount companies pay in tax is more than compensated for by greater efficiency and financial soundness.  after vladimir putin became president in 2000  he did not raise taxes  but put a lot of effort - too much  critics argue - into enforcement.  since then  the russian stock market has more than trebled in value  a rise the authors attribute at least in part to the newly tough approach. the report highlights the case of sibneft  a russian oil company that came close to merging with yukos last year. after mr putin came to power  the company s overall effective tax rate rose from 2.6% to 10.4%  and sibneft was the target of a series of aggressive raids by fiscal police. but shareholders benefited hugely: sibneft started to pay dividends - $53m in 2000 and almost $1bn in 2001 - and closed down the network of opaque subsidiaries it had previously used for siphoning off unofficial funds. according to the authors  although a variety of changes were sweeping through russian industry at the time  the increase in tax enforcement is the only likely explanation for the change of fortunes at sibneft and many of its peers.  does this analysis make sense  in part  certainly. for all its faults  corporate russia has become far more orderly and law-abiding since 2000. companies have rushed to list their shares on international stock exchanges - something unthinkable in the wilder days of the 1990s - and most large firms now produce their accounts to international standards. foreign direct investment  long negligible  is starting to flow in serious amounts - $7bn in 2003 - and stock market returns have been among the healthiest in europe. but the authors  model does not quite cover all the complexities. for a start  the model assumes that the various parties have clearly-defined motivation: companies want to maximise profit  governments want to maximise tax revenue. in fact  the alarmingly close connections between big business and government in russia - connections often greased by bribery - blur the apparently antagonistic relationship. companies can  for example  persuade officials to overlook non-payment of taxes.  and the authors  definition of tax enforcement seems unrealistically western. genuine  disinterested tax collection might well work wonders in russia; the problem with recent examples has been the erratic and unpredictable way laws are enforced. the case against yukos  for example  has moved in fits and starts  with little clarity from the government about its intentions  and little faith from investors that the letter of the law would be followed. as far as most commentators are concerned  the state is pursuing yukos out of a political vendetta  rather than simply to enforce fiscal rectitude. since yukos  founder  mikhail khodorkovsky  was arrested a year ago  the russian market has dropped by 10% - an indication that few investors feel optimistic about the salutary effect on corporate performance.,could yuko bless disguis thing equal notion entrepreneur languish jail compani sell song ought bad busi lookingglass world modern russia opposit might true new report argu studi centr econom polici research prais rough handl oil compani yuko argu rigor tax polic benefit russian firm even target tax polic increas tax enforc increas amount dividend incom outsid sharehold receiv even account increas level taxat author say paper reason complex base sophist model relationship tax regim corpor govern particular propens manag steal compani calcul demonstr mani russian analyst alreadi knew increas tax rate increas amount manag steal sinc undeclar incom becom rel valuabl west meanwhil high tax rate translat far smoothli high govern revenu hand increas rigour tax collect encourag compani becom transpar forc abl demonstr financi posit far accur net result author say extra amount compani pay tax compens great effici financi sound vladimir putin becam presid rais tax put lot effort much critic argu enforc sinc russian stock market trebl valu rise author attribut least part newli tough approach report highlight case sibneft russian oil compani come close merg yuko last year mr putin come power compani overal effect tax rate rise sibneft target seri aggress raid fiscal polic sharehold benefit huge sibneft start pay dividend m almost bn close network opaqu subsidiari previous use siphon unoffici fund accord author although varieti chang sweep russian industri time increas tax enforc like explan chang fortun sibneft mani peer analysi make sen part certainli fault corpor russia becom far orderli lawabid sinc compani rush list share intern stock exchang someth unthink wilder day s larg firm produc account intern standard foreign direct invest long neglig start flow seriou amount bn stock market return among healthiest europ author model quit cover complex start model assum variou parti clearlydefin motiv compani want maximis profit govern want maximis tax revenu fact alarmingli close connect big busi govern russia connect often greas briberi blur appar antagonist relationship compani exampl persuad offici overlook nonpay tax author definit tax enforc seem unrealist western genuin disinterest tax collect might well work wonder russia problem recent exampl errat unpredict way law enforc case yuko exampl move fit start littl clariti govern intent littl faith investor letter law would follow far comment concern state pursu yuko polit vendetta rather simpli enforc fiscal rectitud sinc yuko founder mikhail khodorkovski arrest year ago russian market drop indic investor feel optimist salutari effect corpor perform
205,2118,wales stars need a rest - ruddock wales coach mike ruddock has defended his decision not to release any of the international stars for this weekend s regional celtic league fixtures.  ruddock says the players will benefit from the rest  and their absence will give youngsters a chance to impress.  we ve got the wru charter in place now which outlines exactly what happens   ruddock told bbc wales sport.  once we re in the six nations  the players will only be released in his and the wru s best interests.  the ospreys and scarlets say they are happy to support the wales cause  but the dragons have expressed disappointment at not being able to use their national squad players in friday s game with ulster. ceri sweeney  gareth cooper  ian gough and kevin morgan have been used sparingly by ruddock in the opening two six nations wins and captain jason forster believes they would benefit from a game with the dragons.   i m sure the guys would want to come back to get some game time   forster told bbc wales sport.  it would also be a timely reminder to mike [ruddock] as to what they can do.  and the supporters want to see the star players - no disrespect to the other guys - performing on the pitch.  ruddock  though  is keen to protect his players from injury and fatigue.  at this stage  there s nothing more [the players] can do in games to impress me further.  we ve got to look at it at another angle and see the opportunities that are provided for the younger players in the region.  for example  the dragons might use james ireland this weekend. i ve been looking at the lad - he s a great prospect for the future.  french and english clubs have requested to have all their international players available which means stephen jones  gareth thomas and mefin davies will play this weekend. the majority of ireland and scotland players have also been released for provincial duty.,wale star need rest ruddock wale coach mike ruddock defend decis releas intern star weekend region celtic leagu fixtur ruddock say player benefit rest absenc give youngster chanc impress get wru charter place outlin exactli happen ruddock told bbc wale sport six nation player releas wru best interest osprey scarlet say happi support wale caus dragon express disappoint abl use nation squad player friday game ulster ceri sweeney gareth cooper ian gough kevin morgan use sparingli ruddock open two six nation win captain jason forster believ would benefit game dragon sure guy would want come back get game time forster told bbc wale sport would also time remind mike ruddock support want see star player disrespect guy perform pitch ruddock though keen protect player injuri fatigu stage noth player game impress get look anoth angl see opportun provid young player region exampl dragon might use jame ireland weekend look lad great prospect futur french english club request intern player avail mean stephen jone gareth thoma mefin davi play weekend major ireland scotland player also releas provinci duti
206,2017,what high-definition will do to dvds first it was the humble home video  then it was the dvd  and now hollywood is preparing for the next revolution in home entertainment - high-definition.  high-definition gives incredible  3d-like pictures and surround sound. the dvd disks and the gear to play them will not be out for another year or so  and there at are still a number of issues to be sorted out. but when high-definition films do come out on the new format dvds  it will profoundly change home entertainment. for rick dean  director of business development for digital content company thx  a high-definition future is an exciting prospect. he has worked on the star wars dvd trilogy  finding nemo  the incredibles and indiana jones.  there was a time not so long ago when the film world and the video world were two completely separate worlds   he told the bbc news website.   the technology we are dealing with now means they are very much conjoined.  the film that we see in theatres is coming from the same digital file that we take the home video master   he says. but currently  putting a master feature film onto dvd requires severe compression because current dvd technology cannot hold as much as high-definition films demand.  as much as you compress the picture data rate wise  you also take qualities away from the picture that we fight so hard to keep in the master   he explains.  i would love to be able to show people what projects that we worked on really look like in the high-def world and i find it very exciting.   high-definition dvds can hold up to six times more data than the dvds we are used to. it will take time though to persuade people who spent money on dvd players to buy the different players and displays required to watch high-definition dvds in 18 months  time. mr dean is confident though:  i think if they see real hd [high-definition]  not some heavily compressed version of it  there is such a remarkable difference.  i have heard comments from people who say the images pop off the screen.   high-definition will mean some changes for those working behind the scenes too. on the whole  producing films for high-definition dvds will be easier in some ways because less compression is needed. equally  it may mean hollywood studios ask for more to be put onto the average dvd.  when we master movies right now  our data rates are running at about 1.2 gigabits per second   says mr dean.  our dvds that we put out today have to be squashed down to about five or six megabits per second.  that s a huge amount of compression that has to be applied - about 98%. so if you have anything that allows more space  you don t have to compress so hard.  studios could fit a lot more marketing material  games  and features  onto high-capacity dvds. currently  an entire dvd project can take up to three months  says mr dean. although the step of down-converting will be bypassed  this will realistically only save a day s work  says mr dean. one of the most time consuming elements is building dvd navigation and menu systems. on the fairly complex star wars disks  making sure the menu buttons worked took 45 human hours alone. if studios want to cash in on the extra space  it could mean extra human hours  for which someone has to pay.  if the decision on the studio side is that they are going to put a lot more on these disks  it could be more expensive because of all the extra navigation that is required.  and if studios do focus on delivering more  added value content   thinks mr dean  ultimately it could mean that they will want more money for it. those costs could filter down to the price ticket on a high-definition dvd. but if the consumer is not willing to pay a premium price  studios will listen  thinks mr dean.  high-definition throws up other challenge to film makers and dvd production alike. more clarity on screen means film makers have to make doubly sure that attention to detail is meticulous.  when we did the first hd version of star wars episode i  everybody was very sun-tanned  but that was make-up.  in the hd version of episode i  all these make-up lines showed up   explains mr dean. the restoration of the older star wars episodes revealed some interesting items too.   there are scans of a corridor [on the death star] and fairly plainly in one of those shots  there is a file cabinet stuck behind one of the doorways.  you never used to be able to see it because things are just blurred enough during the pan that you just didn t see it.  what high-definition revolution ultimately means is that the line between home entertainment and cinema worlds will blur. with home theatre systems turning living rooms into cinemas  this line blurs even further. it could also mean that how we get films  and in what format  will widen.  in the future we are going to look towards file delivery over ip [internet protocol - broadband]  giving a dvd-like experience from the set-top box to the hard drive   says mr dean. but that is some time off for most  and for now  people still like to show off something physical in their bookshelves.,highdefinit dvd first humbl home video dvd hollywood prepar next revolut home entertain highdefinit highdefinit give incred dlike pictur surround sound dvd disk gear play anoth year still number issu sort highdefinit film come new format dvd profoundli chang home entertain rick dean director busi develop digit content compani thx highdefinit futur excit prospect work star war dvd trilog find nemo incred indiana jone time long ago film world video world two complet separ world told bbc news websit technolog deal mean much conjoin film see theatr come digit file take home video master say current put master featur film onto dvd requir sever compress current dvd technolog hold much highdefinit film demand much compress pictur data rate wise also take qualiti away pictur fight hard keep master explain would love abl show peopl project work realli look like highdef world find excit highdefinit dvd hold six time data dvd use take time though persuad peopl spent money dvd player buy differ player display requir watch highdefinit dvd month time mr dean confid though think see real hd highdefinit heavili compress version remark differ heard comment peopl say imag pop screen highdefinit mean chang work behind scene whole produc film highdefinit dvd easy way less compress need equal may mean hollywood studio ask put onto averag dvd master movi right data rate run gigabit per second say mr dean dvd put today squash five six megabit per second huge amount compress appli anyth allow space compress hard studio could fit lot market materi game featur onto highcapac dvd current entir dvd project take three month say mr dean although step downconvert bypass realist save day work say mr dean one time consum element build dvd navig menu system fairli complex star war disk make sure menu button work take human hour alon studio want cash extra space could mean extra human hour someon pay decis studio side go put lot disk could expens extra navig requir studio focu deliv ad valu content think mr dean ultim could mean want money cost could filter price ticket highdefinit dvd consum will pay premium price studio listen think mr dean highdefinit throw challeng film maker dvd product alik clariti screen mean film maker make doubli sure attent detail meticul first hd version star war episod everybodi suntan makeup hd version episod makeup line show explain mr dean restor old star war episod reveal interest item scan corridor death star fairli plainli one shot file cabinet stuck behind one doorway never use abl see thing blur enough pan see highdefinit revolut ultim mean line home entertain cinema world blur home theatr system turn live room cinema line blur even could also mean get film format widen futur go look toward file deliveri ip internet protocol broadband give dvdlike experi settop box hard drive say mr dean time peopl still like show someth physic bookshelv
207,581,napster offers rented music to go music downloading  for those that have rejected the free peer to peer services  can be a costly business.  the cost of paying even as little as 70p per track can add up  particularly for those people who own one of the new generation of players that can store thousands of songs. paying per track for music is becoming as outmoded as paying per minute for internet access and alternative monthly or yearly subscription models are springing up as a more convenient  and ultimately cheaper way of owning music.   music fans are moving away from buying the traditional bundled package of a dozen or more songs that we used to call an album to newer ways that fit their lifestyle; either single tracks or subscriptions services   said paul myers  chief executive of wippit  a uk-based music download service. while itunes is doing good business with its sales of individual tracks to ipod owners  others are questioning whether the concept of owning music is even valid in the digital age. napster is due to launch a new rental subscription service - dubbed napster to go in the uk in the next few months. the service can be used on players that support microsoft windows latest digital rights management technology known as janus. this includes players made by samsung  rio and creative.  currently on offer in beta-version in the us  the service costs $15 per month for unlimited downloads. the technology ensures that music downloaded to the player only remains playable while the user subscribes to the service. users need to update their license on a monthly basis or the tunes will no longer play.  this has outraged some digital music lovers  especially as napster already offers a cheaper service for downloading music to the pc. napster claims the higher price is a result of record labels charging more for the to-go service and says it also offers  greater value  for customers. mr myers is not convinced a rental model will work for consumers.  we ve been offering our unlimited music subscription service for more than three years now and our customers know what they want. format interoperability  excellent value and the reassurance that music purchased from wippit is theirs to keep and enjoy on whatever device they choose   he said.  who wants to download a track that won t play next month if you decide to unsubscribe to the service or change portable player for an ipod or the latest mobile phone   wippit offers a download subscription service for £4.99 per month or £50 per year. it has a catalogue of around 60 000 songs.,napster offer rent music go music download reject free peer peer servic costli busi cost pay even littl p per track add particularli peopl one new gener player store thousand song pay per track music becom outmod pay per minut internet access altern monthli yearli subscript model spring conveni ultim cheaper way own music music fan move away buy tradit bundl packag dozen song use call album newer way fit lifestyl either singl track subscript servic say paul myer chief execut wippit ukbas music download servic itun good busi sale individu track ipod owner other question whether concept own music even valid digit age napster due launch new rental subscript servic dub napster go uk next month servic use player support microsoft window late digit right manag technolog know janu includ player make samsung rio creativ current offer betavers u servic cost per month unlimit download technolog ensur music download player remain playabl user subscrib servic user need updat licens monthli basi tune longer play outrag digit music lover especi napster alreadi offer cheaper servic download music pc napster claim high price result record label charg togo servic say also offer great valu custom mr myer convinc rental model work consum offer unlimit music subscript servic three year custom know want format interoper excel valu reassur music purchas wippit keep enjoy whatev devic choos say want download track play next month decid unsubscrib servic chang portabl player ipod late mobil phone wippit offer download subscript servic £ per month £ per year catalogu around song

209,1908,winn-dixie files for bankruptcy us supermarket group winn-dixie has filed for bankruptcy protection after succumbing to stiff competition in a market dominated by wal-mart.  winn-dixie  once among the most profitable of us grocers  said chapter 11 protection would enable it to successfully restructure. it said its 920 stores would remain open  but analysts said it would most likely off-load a number of sites. the jacksonville  florida-based firm has total debts of $1.87bn (£980m). in its bankruptcy petition it listed its biggest creditor as us foods giant kraft foods  which it owes $15.1m.  analysts say winn-dixie had not kept up with consumers  demands and had also been burdened by a number of stores in need of upgrading. a 10-month restructuring plan was deemed a failure  and following a larger-than-expected quarterly loss earlier this month  winn-dixie s slide into bankruptcy was widely expected. the company s new chief executive peter lynch said winn-dixie would use the chapter 11 breathing space to take the necessary action to turn itself around.  this includes achieving significant cost reductions  improving the merchandising and customer service in all locations and generating a sense of excitement in the stores   he said. yet evan mann  a senior bond analyst at gimme credit  said mr lynch s job would not be easy  as the bankruptcy would inevitably put off some customers.  the real big issue is what s going to happen over the next one or two quarters now that they are in bankruptcy and all their customers see this in their local newspapers   he said.,winndixi file bankruptci u supermarket group winndixi file bankruptci protect succumb stiff competit market domin walmart winndixi among profit u grocer say chapter protect would enabl success restructur say store would remain open analyst say would like offload number site jacksonvil floridabas firm total debt bn £m bankruptci petit list big creditor u food giant kraft food owe m analyst say winndixi kept consum demand also burden number store need upgrad month restructur plan deem failur follow largerthanexpect quarterli loss earlier month winndixi slide bankruptci wide expect compani new chief execut peter lynch say winndixi would use chapter breath space take necessari action turn around includ achiev signific cost reduct improv merchandis custom servic locat gener sen excit store say yet evan mann senior bond analyst gim credit say mr lynch job would easi bankruptci would inevit put custom real big issu go happen next one two quarter bankruptci custom see local newspap say

212,960,optimism remains over uk housing the uk property market remains robust despite the recent slowdown  according to mortgage lender bradford & bingley and housebuilder george wimpey.  b&b said the buy-to-let market - in which the bank is a major player - would continue to grow much faster than the wider mortgage market. the comments came as it reported a 6% rise in profits to £280.2m ($532m). wimpey reported a 19% rise in profits to £450.7m and said recent new home reservations were better than expected.  recent housing market surveys have indicated that the uk property market has cooled in recent months after several years of rapid growth. last week  figures from the council of mortgage lenders (cml) indicated that the popularity of buy-to-let mortgages - a key phenomenon of the housing boom - could be waning.  but b&b - which has a 22% share of the uk buy-to-let mortgage market - said that while rates of growth were moderating  the sector  continues to grow at a rate considerably above that of the whole mortgage market . overall  b&b said that  housing market fundamentals remain strong .  interest rates and unemployment are both likely to remain at historically low levels  real household incomes should continue to grow and housing demand is likely to outstrip supply into the medium-term.  despite the upbeat tone  shares in b&b were down more than 4% at 325.5p in morning trade as analysts worried over future earnings growth.  wimpey s profit figures came in at the top of expectations  with the numbers helped by buoyant sales in the us offsetting a slight slowdown in the uk. wimpey said the uk housing market had proved  challenging  last year.  by late summer  the market in general had slowed sharply across the country and showed no real improvement during the autumn   it added. however  the first seven weeks of this year had produced promising signs  wimpey said.  visitor levels and interest in this period have been encouraging and reservations have been at the stronger end of our expectations.  shares in wimpey were up 6% at 458.5p in morning trade.,optim remain uk hous uk properti market remain robust despit recent slowdown accord mortgag lender bradford bingley housebuild georg wimpey bb say buytolet market bank major player would continu grow much faster wider mortgag market comment come report rise profit £m m wimpey report rise profit £m say recent new home reserv well expect recent hous market survey indic uk properti market cool recent month sever year rapid growth last week figur council mortgag lender cml indic popular buytolet mortgag key phenomenon hous boom could wane bb share uk buytolet mortgag market say rate growth moder sector continu grow rate consider whole mortgag market overal bb say hous market fundament remain strong interest rate unemploy like remain histor low level real household incom continu grow hous demand like outstrip suppli mediumterm despit upbeat tone share bb p morn trade analyst worri futur earn growth wimpey profit figur come top expect number help buoyant sale u offset slight slowdown uk wimpey say uk hous market prove challeng last year late summer market gener slow sharpli across countri show real improv autumn ad howev first seven week year produc promis sign wimpey say visitor level interest period encourag reserv strong end expect share wimpey p morn trade

216,415,brown and blair face new rift claims for the umpteenth time  tony blair and gordon brown are said to have declared all out war on each other.  this time the alleged rift is over who should take the credit for the government s global aid and debt initiatives  particularly in the wake of the tsunami disaster - an issue many hoped and believed was above such things. it dominated the prime minister s monthly news conference  which saw mr blair start in full irritation mode as he was forced to bat away question after question about his relationship with his neighbour. as he told journalists:  i am not interested in what goes in and out of newspapers. there is a complete unity of purpose.  and he again heaped praise on mr brown saying he was doing a great job  and would continue doing it - although he would not commit to any job for mr brown after the election.  so why did he arrange his press conference at the last moment so it coincided with mr brown s long-arranged keynote speech on aid and debt  he was asked  by now mr blair had moved from irritation mode to his barely disguised fury setting. he snapped back that the hacks knew very well what the operational reasons were for the timing of his press conference. well  not really  as it happens.  and he repeated what a great man gordon was and how united they were  before again sneering that he took absolutely no notice of what went in and out of the newspapers  preferring to get on with the job of doing the best for the country and the world. although in the next breath he declared:  i get increasingly alarmed by what i read in the newspapers  before catching himself on and quickly adding:  in so far as i read them of course.  he probably had good reason to be alarmed because the newspapers had been full of stories about the claimed open warfare between the two men.  as far as the timing of the prime minister s press conference is concerned  there are two options. the first is that it was a calculated attempt to upstage the chancellor and seize back the initiative on the big issue of the moment. if that is the case it suggests that even the fear of seriously negative newspaper headlines is not enough to stop the squabbling. the second option is that it was an unavoidable coincidence  which would suggest the government has lost its once-famed ability to strictly co-ordinate announcements - through the infamous downing street grid - to avert just such allegations.  either way  the effect was the same - to overshadow the big announcements of government policy on a hugely pertinent issue. and there had been previous suggestions that the new year had started with a fresh outbreak of the warfare between the two men. firstly  the prime minister insisted on wednesday that he had been intimately involved in the development of the proposals to get g8 countries to freeze debt repayments from the tsunami-hit countries. it was claimed he had been embarrassed by the fact that gordon brown appeared to have taken the initiative over the government s response to the disaster while mr blair was still on holiday in egypt.  then  as if to pour fuel on the flames  both men separately spoke about working on tsunami or wider aid and development policy with their cabinet colleagues foreign secretary jack straw  aid minister hilary benn and deputy prime minister john prescott - without mentioning the other. all this came amid fresh claims that mr brown was still seething that he had been excluded from a prominent role in general election planning and had  as a result  started to set out his own platform. the fact that he used an article in the guardian newspaper to set out what he believed  should  be in the manifesto  has embarked on a mini tour of britain to set out his aid plans and will next week visit africa on the same mission - often seen as the prime minister s  turf  - has only added to the impression of rival camps operating entirely independently of each other. the prime minister denied all that as well  repeating his insistence that it was inconceivable the economy and the chancellor would not be at the centre of the election campaign. but the big fear with many on the labour benches now is that  unless a lid can be put on the speculation over the rivalry  it may even threaten to undermine the election campaign itself.,brown blair face new rift claim umpteenth time toni blair gordon brown say declar war time alleg rift take credit govern global aid debt initi particularli wake tsunami disast issu mani hope believ thing domin prime minist monthli news confer saw mr blair start full irrit mode forc bat away question question relationship neighbour told journalist interest goe newspap complet uniti purpos heap prais mr brown say great job would continu although would commit job mr brown elect arrang press confer last moment coincid mr brown longarrang keynot speech aid debt ask mr blair move irrit mode bare disguis furi set snap back hack knew well oper reason time press confer well realli happen repeat great man gordon unit sneer take absolut notic go newspap prefer get job best countri world although next breath declar get increasingli alarm read newspap catch quickli ad far read cours probabl good reason alarm newspap full stori claim open warfar two men far time prime minist press confer concern two option first calcul attempt upstag chancellor seiz back initi big issu moment case suggest even fear serious neg newspap headlin enough stop squabbl second option unavoid coincid would suggest govern lose oncefam abil strictli coordin announc infam down street grid avert alleg either way effect overshadow big announc govern polici huge pertin issu previou suggest new year start fresh outbreak warfar two men firstli prime minist insist wednesday intim involv develop propos get g countri freez debt repay tsunamihit countri claim embarrass fact gordon brown appear take initi govern respons disast mr blair still holiday egypt pour fuel flame men separ spoke work tsunami wider aid develop polici cabinet colleagu foreign secretari jack straw aid minist hilari benn deputi prime minist john prescott without mention come amid fresh claim mr brown still seeth exclud promin role gener elect plan result start set platform fact use articl guardian newspap set believ manifesto embark mini tour britain set aid plan next week visit africa mission often see prime minist turf ad impress rival camp oper entir independ prime minist deni well repeat insist inconceiv economi chancellor would centr elect campaign big fear mani labour bench unless lid put specul rivalri may even threaten undermin elect campaign

218,2133,what s next for next-gen consoles  the next generation of video games consoles are in development but what will the new machines mean for games firms and consumers  we may not know when they will be released  what they will be called or even what they will be able to do but one thing is certain - they are coming. sony  microsoft and nintendo are all expected to release new machines in the next 18 months. the details of playstation 3  xbox 2 (codename xenon) and nintendo s so-called revolution are still to be finalised but developers are having to work on titles for the new machines regardless.   we know maybe what the ps3 will do  but we can only guess   said rory armes  studio general manager for video game giant electronic arts in europe.  it s a horrendous effort in the first year   he admitted. microsoft had delivered development kits to ea  said mr armes  but he said the company was still waiting on sony and nintendo to send kits. although the details may not be nailed down  mr armes said ea was beginning to get a sense of the capabilities of the new machines.  the rumours are that playstation 3 will have a little more under the hood [than xbox 2]   he said.   microsoft is obviously a software company first and foremost  while sony has more experience in hardware. i think sony will be able to push more into a box at cost.   what is certain is that the new machines will provide great leaps in processing and graphical power. it is also likely that they will contain convergence technologies to make the machines more of an entertainment hub. at the consumer electronics show in las vegas microsoft boss bill gates said xbox 2 would be part of his vision of the digital lifestyle. while short on detail  he painted a picture of a machine that would complement a pc and offer  great video gaming but video gaming for a broader set of people  more communications  more media  more connectivity . sony is thought to have a similar vision for ps3 while nintendo remain focused on a machine purely for games.  until it is clear precisely what the new machines can do  developers are working on a first round of titles to harness the new horsepower. gary dunn  development director at codemasters  said the company had a central technology group which was at the forefront of preparing for the next generation of consoles.  we are working on new libraries of effects. a lot of the major techniques are already out there and in use in pc gaming  such as pixel shaders and normal mapping.   mr dunn said he expected the introduction of real-world physics to be a major part of the new consoles.  we want to increase that level of immersion and realism in gaming to people can lose themselves in a game.  in the first year at least  developers said gamers should not expect games which harness the full potential of the machines. graphical spit and polish and better physics in line with the capabilities of current high-end graphics cards for pcs should be expected. simon gardner  president of climax s action studio  said:  it s definitely an exciting time. we want to give more freedom to the player. we want to give players an emotional connection to the characters they play.  the environments will be much more believable and dramatic  growing and changing as you play.  there will be a breadth of effects  more involving worlds to play in.   it s a bit like being an artist and being given a bigger canvas and a smaller brush. we re being given more tools.  for the average consumer  we can get things of a more filmic quality.  gerhard florin  head of ea in europe  said gamers should expect titles that blur the line between films and video games. many will be sceptical - gamers were given similar predictions during the last transition of console hardware - but this time it would seem to be more likely.  ps3 will provide graphics indistinguishable from movies   said mr florin. he said the distribution method for games would also change radically in the next round of consoles.  a gamer could buy a starter disc for 10 euros. when he goes home he goes online and he could buy ai and levels as you go.   it s much smarter if you can get levels as you go.  mr armes warned that developers still had to learn how to tell stories effectively in the medium.  in some ways we are trying to forget about the hardware  go in the opposite direction. we have been very bad at letting technology design our creativity.  what we have to do as a company is start ignoring the technology and learning our craft in telling stories.  mr gardner agreed:  we can thrown more polygons around and have better ai but if it doesn t make for a better game then that s not very useful.  developers will certainly have the tools with the new machines  but how they employ them is still to be decided.,next nextgen consol next gener video game consol develop new machin mean game firm consum may know releas call even abl one thing certain come soni microsoft nintendo expect releas new machin next month detail playstat xbox codenam xenon nintendo socal revolut still finalis develop work titl new machin regardless know mayb p guess say rori arm studio gener manag video game giant electron art europ horrend effort first year admit microsoft deliv develop kit ea say mr arm say compani still wait soni nintendo send kit although detail may nail mr arm say ea begin get sen capabl new machin rumour playstat littl hood xbox say microsoft obvious softwar compani first foremost soni experi hardwar think soni abl push box cost certain new machin provid great leap process graphic power also like contain converg technolog make machin entertain hub consum electron show la vega microsoft bos bill gate say xbox would part vision digit lifestyl short detail paint pictur machin would complement pc offer great video game video game broader set peopl commun medium connect soni thought similar vision p nintendo remain focus machin pure game clear precis new machin develop work first round titl har new horsepow gari dunn develop director codemast say compani central technolog group forefront prepar next gener consol work new librari effect lot major techniqu alreadi use pc game pixel shader normal map mr dunn say expect introduct realworld physic major part new consol want increas level immers realism game peopl lose game first year least develop say gamer expect game har full potenti machin graphic spit polish well physic line capabl current highend graphic card pc expect simon gardner presid climax action studio say definit excit time want give freedom player want give player emot connect charact play environ much believ dramat grow chang play breadth effect involv world play bit like artist give big canva small brush give tool averag consum get thing filmic qualiti gerhard florin head ea europ say gamer expect titl blur line film video game mani sceptic gamer give similar predict last transit consol hardwar time would seem like p provid graphic indistinguish movi say mr florin say distribut method game would also chang radic next round consol gamer could buy starter disc euro goe home goe onlin could buy ai level go much smarter get level go mr arm warn develop still learn tell stori effect medium way tri forget hardwar go opposit direct bad let technolog design creativ compani start ignor technolog learn craft tell stori mr gardner agre thrown polygon around well ai make well game use develop certainli tool new machin employ still decid
219,1175,what really divides the parties so what is the gap between labour and the tories nowadays   one starbucks  one rymans and one small greek cafe as it happens. both parties have now completed their moves to new headquarters  with labour creating its election hub just three doors away from the tories  new headquarters in victoria street  just down the road from the commons. that should make things a little easier if and when the crack-of-dawn election press conferences kick off. unlike 2001  there should be no need for colleagues to have taxis gunning their engines outside  or to buy scooters  to get themselves between the tightly-timetabled events.  and  to all intents and purposes  we already appear to be in that general election campaign. certainly the press conference hosted by election co-ordinator alan milburn  in the rather compact new conference room - still smelling of new carpet and with the garish new labour coffee mugs as yet unstained - had all the hallmarks of an election event.   welcome to the unremittingly new labour media centre   he said. and i ll bet he hadn t checked that one with gordon brown. along with work and pensions secretary alan johnson and minister for work jane kennedy  he then went on to tear into the tory plans to scrap the new deal welfare-to-work scheme  which they claimed would lead to an increase of almost 300 000 in unemployment. and they ridiculed the claims made on monday by michael howard that he could save £35 billion of labour waste and inefficiency to spend on public services while also offering £4 billion of tax cuts. labour has come up with a figure of £22 billions worth of efficiency savings so  understandably perhaps  believe mr howard must be planning cuts to squeeze the extra £13 billion. these figures  based on the two parties  own detailed studies  will be battered to within an inch of their lives during the campaign. wednesday was just the start.,realli divid parti gap labour torus nowaday one starbuck one ryman one small greek cafe happen parti complet move new headquart labour creat elect hub three door away torus new headquart victoria street road common make thing littl easy crackofdawn elect press confer kick unlik need colleagu taxi gun engin outsid buy scooter get tightlytimet event intent purpos alreadi appear gener elect campaign certainli press confer host elect coordin alan milburn rather compact new confer room still smell new carpet garish new labour coffe mug yet unstain hallmark elect event welcom unremittingli new labour medium centr say bet check one gordon brown along work pension secretari alan johnson minist work jane kennedi go tear torus plan scrap new deal welfaretowork scheme claim would lead increas almost unemploy ridicul claim make monday michael howard could save £ billion labour wast ineffici spend public servic also offer £ billion tax cut labour come figur £ billion worth effici save understand perhap believ mr howard must plan cut squeez extra £ billion figur base two parti detail studi batter within inch live campaign wednesday start

221,1951,pompeii gets digital make-over the old-fashioned audio tour of historical places could soon be replaced with computer-generated images that bring the site to life.  a european union-funded project is looking at providing tourists with computer-augmented versions of archaeological attractions. it would allow visitors a glimpse of life as it was originally lived in places such as pompeii. it could pave the way for a new form of cultural tourism.  the technology would allow digital people and other computer-generated elements to be combined with the actual view seen by tourists as they walk around an historical site.  the lifeplus project is part of the eu s information society technologies initiative aimed at promoting user-friendly technology and enhancing european cultural heritage. engineers and researchers working in the europe-wide consortium have come up with a prototype augmented-reality system. it would require the visitor to wear a head-mounted display with a miniature camera and a backpack computer. the camera captures the view and feeds it to software on the computer where the visitor s viewpoint is combined with animated virtual elements. at pompeii for example  the visitor would not just see the frescos  taverns and villas that have been excavated  but also people going about their daily life. augmented reality has been used to create special effects in films such as troy and lord of the rings and in computer gaming.   this technology can now be used for much more than just computer games   said professor nadia magnenat-thalman of the swiss research group miralab.   we are  for the first time  able to run this combination of software processes to create walking  talking people with believable clothing  skin and hair in real-time   she said. unlike virtual reality  which delivers an entirely computer-generated scene to the viewer  the lifeplus project is about combining digital and real views. crucial to the technique is the software that interprets the visitor s view and provides an accurate match between the real and virtual elements. the software capable of doing this has been developed by a uk company  2d3. andrew stoddart  chief scientist at 2d3  said that the eu project has been driven by a new desire to bring the past to life.  the popularity of television documentaries and dramatisations using computer-generated imagery to recreate scenes from ancient history demonstrates the widespread appeal of bringing ancient cultures to life   he said.,pompeii get digit makeov oldfashion audio tour histor place could soon replac computergener imag bring site life european unionfund project look provid tourist computeraug version archaeolog attract would allow visitor glimps life origin live place pompeii could pave way new form cultur tourism technolog would allow digit peopl computergener element combin actual view see tourist walk around histor site lifeplu project part eu inform societi technolog initi aim promot userfriendli technolog enhanc european cultur heritag engin research work europewid consortium come prototyp augmentedr system would requir visitor wear headmount display miniatur camera backpack comput camera captur view feed softwar comput visitor viewpoint combin anim virtual element pompeii exampl visitor would see fresco tavern villa excav also peopl go daili life augment realiti use creat special effect film troy lord ring comput game technolog use much comput game say professor nadia magnenatthalman swiss research group miralab first time abl run combin softwar process creat walk talk peopl believ cloth skin hair realtim say unlik virtual realiti deliv entir computergener scene viewer lifeplu project combin digit real view crucial techniqu softwar interpret visitor view provid accur match real virtual element softwar capabl develop uk compani d andrew stoddart chief scientist d say eu project driven new desir bring past life popular televis documentari dramatis use computergener imageri recreat scene ancient histori demonstr widespread appeal bring ancient cultur life say

225,1788,fast lifts rise into record books two high-speed lifts at the world s tallest building have been officially recognised as the planet s fastest.  the lifts take only 30 seconds to whisk passengers to the top of the 508m tall tfc 101 tower in taipei  taiwan. the guinness book of records has declared the 17m per second speed of the two lifts the swiftest on earth. the lifts also have a pressure control system to stop passengers  ears popping as they ascend and descend at high speed.  in total  the tfc tower has 61 lifts  34 of them double-deckers  and 50 escalators to shuttle people around its 106 floors. the tfc 101 tower is due to be officially opened on 31 december.  the super-fast lifts can speed up to 24 passengers to the tip of the tower in about 30 seconds  while ascending their 382m track. the 17m/s top speed of the lifts translates to about 38mph (61km/h). curiously the lifts take longer to descend and spend almost a whole minute returning to ground level from the top of the tfc tower. the key new technologies applied in the world s fastest elevators include:    - a pressure control system  which adjusts the atmospheric pressure inside a car by using suction and discharge blowers  preventing  ear popping    - an active control system which tries to balance the lift more finely and remove the sources of vibrations   - streamlined cars to reduce the whistling noise produced by running the lifts at a high speed inside a narrow shaft      the certification of our elevators as world record-holders by the authoritative guinness world records is a great honour for us   said masayuki shimono  president of manufacturer toshiba elevator and building systems which installed the lifts. the first record for the world s fastest passenger elevators was published in the first edition of the guinness book of records in 1955.  as such  it is an interesting indicator of how technology has advanced in the 50 years since that first edition  when the record was 426m per minute  or 25.6 km/h  less than half the speed of the new record   said hein le roux  specialist researcher at the guinness world records. taipei s tfc 101 tower is more than 50m taller than the petronas towers in kuala lumpur  malaysia - formerly the world s tallest skyscraper.,fast lift rise record book two highspe lift world tallest build offici recognis planet fast lift take second whisk passeng top m tall tfc tower taipei taiwan guin book record declar m per second speed two lift swiftest earth lift also pressur control system stop passeng ear pop ascend descend high speed total tfc tower lift doubledeck escal shuttl peopl around floor tfc tower due offici open decemb superfast lift speed passeng tip tower second ascend m track m top speed lift translat mph kmh curious lift take longer descend spend almost whole minut return ground level top tfc tower key new technolog appli world fast elev includ pressur control system adjust atmospher pressur insid car use suction discharg blower prevent ear pop activ control system tri balanc lift fine remov sourc vibrat streamlin car reduc whistl nois produc run lift high speed insid narrow shaft certif elev world recordhold authorit guin world record great honour u say masayuki shimono presid manufactur toshiba elev build system instal lift first record world fast passeng elev publish first edit guin book record interest indic technolog advanc year sinc first edit record m per minut kmh less half speed new record say hein le roux specialist research guin world record taipei tfc tower m taller petrona tower kuala lumpur malaysia formerli world tallest skyscrap
226,544,economy  strong  in election year uk businesses are set to prosper during the next few months - but this could trigger more interest rate rises  according to a report.  optimism is at its highest since 1997 and business will reap the benefits of a continuing rise in public spending  say researchers at bdo stoy hayward. the bank of england is expected to keep rates on hold this week - but they could go up later in the year. rates are likely to rise after the anticipated general election in may. the bdo optimism index - a leading indicator of gdp growth two quarters ahead edged up in january to 102.5  from 102.2 in october. the rise is due  in part  to an increase in public spending and increased merger and acquisition activity.  the only thing blighting business optimism this year will be uncertainties associated with the general election  bdo said. its bdo s output index - which predicts gdp movements a quarter in advance - remained at 100.8 for january  implying gdp growth at 2.9% in the second quarter of 2005. however  the output index is being held back by recent interest rate rises  sterling s strength against the dollar and high oil prices  the group noted. its inflation index  which has risen continuously over the last 8 months  climbed to 110.0 in january from 108.0 in october last year.  the uk is looking strong going into the general election  but businesses need to prepare themselves for a jolt ahead as the bank of england reacts to growth and inflationary pressures   said peter hemington  partner at bdo stoy hayward.  growth will probably slow by the end of 2005 and it is likely that we will see higher interest rates or a sharp drop in demand for products and services.,economi strong elect year uk busi set prosper next month could trigger interest rate rise accord report optim high sinc busi reap benefit continu rise public spend say research bdo stoy hayward bank england expect keep rate hold week could go later year rate like rise anticip gener elect may bdo optim index lead indic gdp growth two quarter ahead edg januari octob rise due part increas public spend increas merger acquisit activ thing blight busi optim year uncertainti associ gener elect bdo say bdo output index predict gdp movement quarter advanc remain januari impli gdp growth second quarter howev output index held back recent interest rate rise sterl strength dollar high oil price group note inflat index risen continu last month climb januari octob last year uk look strong go gener elect busi need prepar jolt ahead bank england react growth inflationari pressur say peter hemington partner bdo stoy hayward growth probabl slow end like see high interest rate sharp drop demand product servic

229,29,terror suspects face house arrest uk citizens suspected of involvement in terrorism could face house arrest as part of a series of new measures outlined by the home secretary.  it comes after law lords ruled that the detention of 12 foreign terror suspects without trial breached human rights. charles clarke s planned  control orders  mean anyone suspected of being involved in terrorism could be subject to house arrest  curfews or tagging. the law society dubbed mr clarke s new proposals an  abuse of power . deals are already being sought to deport some of the foreign detainees who are mainly held in belmarsh prison in london under the current laws introduced after the us terror attacks on 11 september 2001. mr clarke said efforts would continue to deport them to their countries of origin algeria  tunisia  egypt and jordan without them facing torture or death.  under the proposed changes - prompted by the house of lords ruling - the home secretary could order british citizens or foreign suspects who could not be deported  to face house arrest or other measures such as restrictions on their movements or limits on their use of telephones and the internet.  british citizens are being included in the changes after the law lords said the current powers were discriminatory because they could only be used on foreign suspects. mr clarke also said intelligence reports showed some british nationals were now playing a more significant role in terror threats. human rights lawyer clive stafford-smith said the plans were a  further abuse of human rights in britain .  mr clarke said prosecutions were the government s first preference and promised the powers would only be used in  serious  cases  with independent scrutiny from judges.  he told mps:  there remains a public emergency threatening the life of the nation.  he accepted the law lords  ruling but argued detention powers had helped prevent attacks and deter terrorists. the current detainees would not be freed until the new powers were in place as they were still considered a national security threat  he told mps.  there have been calls for the rules for wire-tap and intercept evidence to be allowed to be used in courts but mr clarke refused to back that change.  he said intercept evidence was only a small part of the case against the men and some of it could not be used because it could put sources  lives at risk. most of the terror suspects are being held indefinitely at belmarsh prison  in london. conservative shadow home secretary david davis was worried about extending special powers to cover british citizens. he warned:  throughout history  internment has generally backfired because of the resentment it creates.  so unless the process is clearly just  the home secretary could find himself confining one known terrorist only to recruit 10 unknown terrorists.  he suggested changing the law to let security-cleared judges view evidence gathered by phone-tapping could allow more terror cases to come to court.  liberal democrat spokesman mark oaten also backed use of wire-tap evidence. he said the standard of proof for the new powers would have to be  very high indeed  and he asked whether ministers had looked at measures which fitted with human rights laws. shami chakrabarti  from human rights group liberty  joined calls for intercept evidence to be allowed in trials. she said:  adherence to the rule of law should not be a game of cat and mouse. the government should not swap one human rights  opt out  for another.,terror suspect face hous arrest uk citizen suspect involv terror could face hous arrest part seri new measur outlin home secretari come law lord rule detent foreign terror suspect without trial breach human right charl clark plan control order mean anyon suspect involv terror could subject hous arrest curfew tag law societi dub mr clark new propos abus power deal alreadi sought deport foreign detaine mainli held belmarsh prison london current law introduc u terror attack septemb mr clark say effort would continu deport countri origin algeria tunisia egypt jordan without face tortur death propos chang prompt hous lord rule home secretari could order british citizen foreign suspect could deport face hous arrest measur restrict movement limit use telephon internet british citizen includ chang law lord say current power discriminatori could use foreign suspect mr clark also say intellig report show british nation play signific role terror threat human right lawyer clive staffordsmith say plan abus human right britain mr clark say prosecut govern first prefer promis power would use seriou case independ scrutini judg told mp remain public emerg threaten life nation accept law lord rule argu detent power help prevent attack deter terrorist current detaine would freed new power place still consid nation secur threat told mp call rule wiretap intercept evid allow use court mr clark refus back chang say intercept evid small part case men could use could put sourc live risk terror suspect held indefinit belmarsh prison london conserv shadow home secretari david davi worri extend special power cover british citizen warn throughout histori intern gener backfir resent creat unless process clearli home secretari could find confin one know terrorist recruit unknown terrorist suggest chang law let securityclear judg view evid gather phonetap could allow terror case come court liber democrat spokesman mark oaten also back use wiretap evid say standard proof new power would high inde ask whether minist look measur fit human right law shami chakrabarti human right group liberti join call intercept evid allow trial say adher rule law game cat mous govern swap one human right opt anoth
230,1355,tories attack burglar  u-turns  tory leader michael howard has accused tony blair of performing u-turns over rules on using force against burglars.  the government has ruled out amending the present law  which allows  reasonable force  in self defence. mr howard branded the decision unacceptable  saying:  it is not householders who should be frightened  it s the burglars.  home secretary charles clarke said ministers had kept to their pledge to review the law.  metropolitan police commissioner sir john stevens last month backed a tory attempt to change the law so only householders using  grossly disproportionate  force could be prosecuted. the pressure prompted the prime minister to say the police and crown prosecution service would be consulted as part of a review of the law. he told mps:  if we get the right response from those people  we will  of course  support a change in the law.  instead  the government has decided no change is needed but there will be a publicity campaign so people are clear they are entitled to defend themselves. on thursday  mr howard told bbc radio 4 s today programme mr blair had initially refused the law change  then had come round to the idea and was now backtracking again. he said:  we ve had three policy positions in three months and two u-turns.  it s not surprising gordon brown told him:  there s nothing you could say to me now that i could ever believe.    mr howard said the  grossly disproportionate  test matched the hurdle ministers had introduced for civil cases where burglars where claimed compensation from householders. the issue entered the public spotlight when norfolk farmer tony martin was jailed for shooting dead a 16-year-old burglar in 1999 as he ran away from the farm. but the home secretary said mr howard was wrong to say the law was biased in favour of burglars. the barrister who had represented mr martin had said the rules were  weighted overwhelmingly  in favour of the householder  said mr clarke. he said:  the problem is there has not been enough understanding of it - that was the point sir john stevens was making and the prime minister was making.  the new guidance would help ensure clarity on the issue  added mr clarke. the director of public prosecutions  ken macdonald  says only 11 householders or occupiers of business premises have been prosecuted in the last 15 years. those cases included a warehouse manager who had waited for a burglar  tied him up  beat him and set him alight  he said. tory mp patrick mercer s private member s bill to change the law received a first reading in parliament on wednesday and goes to a full debate next month.,torus attack burglar uturn torus leader michael howard accus toni blair perform uturn rule use forc burglar govern rule amend present law allow reason forc self defenc mr howard brand decis unaccept say household frighten burglar home secretari charl clark say minist kept pledg review law metropolitan polic commission sir john steven last month back torus attempt chang law household use grossli disproportion forc could prosecut pressur prompt prime minist say polic crown prosecut servic would consult part review law told mp get right respons peopl cours support chang law instead govern decid chang need public campaign peopl clear entitl defend thursday mr howard told bbc radio today programm mr blair initi refus law chang come round idea backtrack say three polici posit three month two uturn surpris gordon brown told noth could say could ever believ mr howard say grossli disproportion test match hurdl minist introduc civil case burglar claim compens household issu enter public spotlight norfolk farmer toni martin jail shoot dead yearold burglar ran away farm home secretari say mr howard wrong say law bias favour burglar barrist repres mr martin say rule weight overwhelmingli favour household say mr clark say problem enough understand point sir john steven make prime minist make new guidanc would help ensur clariti issu ad mr clark director public prosecut ken macdonald say household occupi busi premis prosecut last year case includ warehous manag wait burglar tie beat set alight say torus mp patrick mercer privat member bill chang law receiv first read parliament wednesday goe full debat next month

233,617,uk interest rates held at 4.75% the bank of england has left interest rates on hold again at 4.75%  in a widely-predicted move.  rates went up five times from november 2003 - as the bank sought to cool the housing market and consumer debt - but have remained unchanged since august. recent data has indicated a slowdown in manufacturing and consumer spending  as well as in mortgage approvals. and retail sales disappointed over christmas  with analysts putting the drop down to less consumer confidence.  rising interest rates and the accompanying slowdown in the housing market have knocked consumers  optimism  causing a sharp fall in demand for expensive goods  according to a report earlier this week from the british retail consortium. the brc said britain s retailers had endured their worst christmas in a decade.   today s no change decision is correct   said david frost  director general of the british chambers of commerce (bcc).  but  if there are clear signs that the economy slows  the mpc should be ready to take quick corrective action and cut rates.  dismal reports from the retail trade about christmas sales are worrying  if they indicate a more general weakening in consumer spending.   mr frost added:  the housing market outlook remains highly uncertain.  it is widely accepted that  if house prices start falling more sharply  the risks facing the economy will worsen considerably.  cbi chief economist ian mccafferty said the economy had  slowed in recent months in response to rate rises  but that it was difficult to gauge from the christmas period the likely pace of activity through the summer.  the bank is having to juggle the emergence of inflationary pressures  driven by a tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices  against the risk of an over-abrupt slowdown in consumer activity   he said.  interest rates are likely to remain on hold for some time.   on thursday there was more gloomy news on the manufacturing front  as the office for national (ons) statistics revealed british manufacturing output unexpectedly fell in november - for the fifth month in the past six. the ons said manufacturing output dropped 0.1% in november  matching a similar unrevised fall in october and confounding economists  expectations of a 0.3% rise. manufacturers  organisation  the eef  said it expected the hold in interest rates to continue in the near future. it also said there was evidence that manufacturers  confidence may be waning as the outlook for the world economy becomes more uncertain.   so far the evidence suggests that last year s rate increases have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing   said eef chief economist  steve radley.  however  should the business outlook start to deteriorate  the bank should stand ready to cut rates.  some economists have predicted rates will drop later in the year  although others feel the bank may still think there is a need for a rise to 5% before that happens. the bank remains concerned about the long-term risks posed by personal debt -

234,1793,worldcom bosses  $54m payout ten former directors at worldcom have agreed to pay $54m (£28.85m)  including $18m from their own pockets  to settle a class action lawsuit  reports say.  james wareham  a lawyer representing one of the directors  told reuters the 10 had agreed to pay those who lost billions when the firm collapsed. the remaining $36m will be paid by the directors  insurers. but  a spokesman for the prosecutor  new york state comptroller alan hevesi  said no formal agreement had been made.  corporate governance experts said that if the directors do dip into their own pockets for the settlement  it will set a new standard for the accountability of bosses  when the firms they oversee face problems.   directors very rarely pay   said charles elson  chairman of the center for corporate governance at the university of delaware. he added that the settlement  sends a pretty strong shockwave through the director world . a formal agreement on the payout is expected to be signed on thursday in a us district court in manhattan. earlier  the new york times had reported that the personal payments were required as part of any deal at the start of negotiations. the ten former outside directors are james allen  judith areen  carl aycock  max bobbitt  clifford alexander  stiles kellett  gordon macklin  john porter  lawrence tucker and the estate of john sidgmore  who died last year. it has not yet been determined how much each director will have to pay.  none of the 10 former directors was a direct participant in the accounting machinations of the worldcom fraud   said the wall street journal (wsj).  two other outside former directors  bert roberts and francesco galesi  remain defendants in the lawsuit  said the newspaper. according to the wsj  which cites people familiar to the case  the settling directors are expected to deny wrongdoing and state they are settling the case to eliminate the uncertainties and expense of further litigations. the second-largest us long-distance telecoms operator filed for bankruptcy in 2002 when an $11bn accounting scandal was unearthed. the company emerged from chapter 11 protection last year and changed its name to mci inc. former worldcom chief executive bernard ebbers is to face trial this month on criminal charges that he oversaw the fraud.,worldcom bos m payout ten former director worldcom agre pay m £m includ m pocket settl class action lawsuit report say jame wareham lawyer repres one director told reuter agre pay lose billion firm collaps remain m paid director insur spokesman prosecutor new york state comptrol alan hevesi say formal agreement make corpor govern expert say director dip pocket settlement set new standard account bos firm overse face problem director rare pay say charl elson chairman center corpor govern univers delawar ad settlement send pretti strong shockwav director world formal agreement payout expect sign thursday u district court manhattan earlier new york time report person payment requir part deal start negoti ten former outsid director jame allen judith areen carl aycock max bobbitt clifford alexand stile kellett gordon macklin john porter lawrenc tucker estat john sidgmor die last year yet determin much director pay none former director direct particip account machin worldcom fraud say wall street journal wsj two outsid former director bert robert francesco galesi remain defend lawsuit say newspap accord wsj cite peopl familiar case settl director expect deni wrongdo state settl case elimin uncertainti expens litig secondlargest u longdist telecom oper file bankruptci bn account scandal unearth compani emerg chapter protect last year chang name mci inc former worldcom chief execut bernard ebber face trial month crimin charg oversaw fraud
235,2054,domain system opens door to scams a system to make it easier to create website addresses using alphabets like cyrillic could open a back door for scammers  a trade body has warned.  the internationalised domain names system has been a work in progress for years and has recently been approved by the internet engineering task force. but the uk internet forum (ukif) is concerned that the system will let scammers create fake sites more easily. the problem lies in the computer codes used to represent language.  registering names that look like that of legitimate companies but lead users to fake sites designed to steal passwords and credit card details could become a whole lot easier for determined scammers  says stephen dyer  director of ukif. domain names are the  real language  addresses of websites  rather than their internet protocol address  which is a series of numbers. they are used so people can more easily navigate the web. so-called ascii codes are used to represent european languages but for other languages a hybrid of a system called unicode is used. so  for example  website paypal could now be coded using a mixture of the latin alphabet and the russian alphabet. the resulting domain as displayed to the users would look identical to the real site as a russian  a  look just like an english  a . but the computer code would be different  and the site it would lead users to could be a fake. this is more than just a theory. a fake paypal.com has already been registered with net domain giant verisign by someone who has followed the debate around the internationalised domain name (idn) system  said mr dyer. as the idea was to prove a point rather than be malicious the fake domain has now been handed back to paypal but it sets a worrying precedent  mr dyer said.  although the idn problem is well known in technical circles  the commercial world is totally unaware how easily their websites can be faked   said mr dyer.   it is important to alert users that there is a new and invisible and almost undetectable way of diverting them to what looks like a perfectly genuine site   he added. there are solutions. for instance  browsers could spot domains that use mixed characters and display them in different colours as a warning to users. mr dyer acknowledged that it would be a huge undertaking to update all the world s browsers. another solution  to introduce idn-disabled browsers could be a case of  throwing out the baby with the bath water   he said. centr  the council of european national top level domain registries  agrees.  a rush to introduce idn-disabled browsers into the marketplace is an overly-zealous step that will harm public confidence in idns - a technology that is desperately needed in the non-english speaking world   the organisation said in a statement.,domain system open door scam system make easy creat websit address use alphabet like cyril could open back door scammer trade bodi warn internationalis domain name system work progress year recent approv internet engin task forc uk internet forum ukif concern system let scammer creat fake site easili problem lie comput code use repres languag regist name look like legitim compani lead user fake site design steal password credit card detail could becom whole lot easy determin scammer say stephen dyer director ukif domain name real languag address websit rather internet protocol address seri number use peopl easili navig web socal ascii code use repres european languag languag hybrid system call unicod use exampl websit paypal could code use mixtur latin alphabet russian alphabet result domain display user would look ident real site russian look like english comput code would differ site would lead user could fake theori fake paypalcom alreadi regist net domain giant verisign someon follow debat around internationalis domain name idn system say mr dyer idea prove point rather malici fake domain hand back paypal set worri preced mr dyer say although idn problem well know technic circl commerci world total unawar easili websit fake say mr dyer import alert user new invis almost undetect way divert look like perfectli genuin site ad solut instanc browser could spot domain use mix charact display differ colour warn user mr dyer acknowledg would huge undertak updat world browser anoth solut introduc idndis browser could case throw babi bath water say centr council european nation top level domain registri agre rush introduc idndis browser marketplac overlyzeal step harm public confid idn technolog desper need nonenglish speak world organis say statement
236,2058,high fuel costs hit us airlines two of the largest airlines in the us - american and southwest - have blamed record fuel prices for their disappointing quarterly results.  american airlines  parent amr reported a loss of $387m (£206m) for the fourth quarter of 2004  against a $111m loss for the same period a year earlier. meanwhile  southwest airlines saw its fourth-quarter 2004 profits fall 15% to $56m  against $66m a year earlier. both said high fuel bills would continue to pressure revenues in 2005. american  the world s biggest airline by some measures  said it expected to report a loss for the first quarter of 2005. southwest  which has the highest market value of any us carrier  said it would remain profitable despite high fuel prices.  amr s shares were flat in wednesday morning trading on the new york stock exchange  as the results were slightly better than analysts had anticipated. amr s chief executive gerard arpey said the airline s difficulties reflected the situation within the industry.  amr s results for the fourth quarter of 2004 reflect the economic woes that plagued the airline industry throughout 2004 - in particular  high fuel prices and a tough revenue environment   he said. for the full year  amr posted a loss of $761m  lower than 2003 s $1.2bn loss and an indication that the airline has successfully cut costs. amr added that as part of its cost cutting measures  it is postponing the delivery of 54 boeing jets. shares in southwest fell 65 cents to $14.35 as analysts voiced their disappointment.  the results came in below our already conservative estimate for the quarter   said ray neidl  an analyst at calyon securities. both american and southwest have been squeezed by cut-throat competition in the us airline industry  as a glut of available seats has led to fierce price reductions.,high fuel cost hit u airlin two large airlin u american southwest blame record fuel price disappoint quarterli result american airlin parent amr report loss m £m fourth quarter m loss period year earlier meanwhil southwest airlin saw fourthquart profit fall m m year earlier say high fuel bill would continu pressur revenu american world big airlin measur say expect report loss first quarter southwest high market valu u carrier say would remain profit despit high fuel price amr share flat wednesday morn trade new york stock exchang result slightli well analyst anticip amr chief execut gerard arpey say airlin difficulti reflect situat within industri amr result fourth quarter reflect econom woe plagu airlin industri throughout particular high fuel price tough revenu environ say full year amr post loss m low bn loss indic airlin success cut cost amr ad part cost cut measur postpon deliveri boe jet share southwest fell cent analyst voic disappoint result come alreadi conserv estim quarter say ray neidl analyst calyon secur american southwest squeez cutthroat competit u airlin industri glut avail seat lead fierc price reduct

238,891,wales win in rome wales secured their first away win in the rbs six nations for nearly four years with a six-try victory in rome.  tries from jonathan thomas  tom shanklin and martyn williams gave the visitors a 19-5 half-time advantage. luciano orquera did reply with one for italy but second-half efforts from brent cockbain  shane williams and robert sidoli sealed victory. fly-half stephen jones added four conversions as wales maintained their superb start to this year s tournament. starting full of confidence after their victory over england  the visitors scored the opening try after just four minutes. diminutive wing shane williams fielded a kick ahead and danced past the onrushing andrea masi and aaron persico into the italian half. his pass to tom shanklin appeared forward but when the centre was held up short  the ball was switched left and michael owen s long cut-out pass gave the lurking thomas an easy run-in.  stephen jones  who retained the kicking duties despite gavin henson s heroics against england  slotted an excellent conversion from wide out. wales twice threatened further scores but failed to find the crucial pass  and italy hit back out of the blue in the 11th minute.  henson  sporting gold boots rather than the silver variety that did for england  beat two players with ease out on the left touchline. but his attempted chip ahead was charged down by orquera  who snaffled the loose ball and hared away from halfway to score in the right corner. with the welsh line-out stuttering and italy twice turning the visitors  scrum  the home side s forward power brought them back into it. but a clever high kick from henson almost brought a try for hal luscombe when roland de marigny and ludovico nitoglia made a hash of claiming it as the ball bounced into touch.  wales regained control with a second try in the 21st minute  henson lobbing up a high kick to the left corner where shanklin jumped higher than nitoglia to dot down his 15th test try. jones was unable to convert and de marigny then hit the upright with a penalty attempt for italy. henson was also narrowly short with a long-range effort at goal  but wales ended the half with a vital third score to give themselves some breathing space.  henson sent luscombe streaking away and when he off-loaded to martyn williams  the flanker showed his nous to ground the ball against the padding of the post  jones adding the conversion. italy  who lost flanker mauro bergamasco with a head knock before half-time  built up a head of steam on the resumption. de marigny landed a penalty to make it 19-8 and a nitoglia break through the middle threatened a try only for the move to break down with a knock-on. but wales put the outcome beyond doubt with two superb tries in four minutes before the hour. their fourth after 53 minutes was sparked by another mazy run from shane williams  who beat several players with ease  and finished with a powerful angled run from lock cockbain. before italy could recover from that blow  a strong surge from gareth thomas and great off-loads from martyn williams and replacement kevin morgan saw shane williams scamper over.  with jones converting both for a 33-8 lead  wales had the luxury of sending on five more replacements for the final quarter. the icing on the cake came with a sixth try after more superb support work  shane williams and ceri sweeney combining to send sidoli over in the left corner. the only downside for wales was a hamstring injury suffered by luscombe. but after back-to-back wins at the start of the tournament for the first time in 11 years  they will travel to paris in a fortnight looking like genuine contenders.  r de marigny;

239,898,lib dems target the student vote students can decide the fate of mps in some seats at the next election  liberal democrat leader charles kennedy has claimed.  the party says the votes of students can win it 27 new seats at the poll. the figures assume all students will vote in their university town. in fact  some may vote where the parents live. the lib dems say scrapping university fees wins them student support. but the tories would also end fees and labour says both would cap people s ambitions.  the lib dems have named the 14 seats where there are enough students to take the lib dems from second place to beat labour  and the 13 where they could go from second to beat the tories. launching his campaign to win students  votes at the london school of economics  mr kennedy urged students to  make their mark . he underlined lib dem plans to scrap university fees and reintroduce maintenance grants of up to £2 000. he said:  top-up fees put students off university  especially those from a poorer background.  and is it really right that so many young people are starting out in life with mortgage-style debts hanging round their necks   mr kennedy also said students want action on the environment and see the iraq war  which his party opposed  as a defining issue.  labour has pushed through plans to let universities charge fees of up to £3 000 a year  with the poorest students eligible for non-repayable support of up to £3 000. ahead of mr kennedy s launch  a labour spokesperson said:  like the tories  the liberal democrats would restrict access to higher education and put a cap on aspiration  closing the door to students with good grades and restricting their life ambitions.  they are committed to abandoning labour s targets of getting 50% of 18 to 30-year-olds going into higher education and under lib dem plans students would even have to study near home.  the conservatives say they would abolish university tuition fees and instead offer large student loans at commercial rates of interest.  they say the lib dem policy would leave universities wholly dependent for their income on the  goodwill  of the chancellor.  shadow education secretary tim collins is on thursday setting out a new scheme of vocational grants for 14 to 16-year-olds to tackle what he says are  crippling skills shortages . the lib dem analysis of the difference students could make to its election chances is based on all students being registered to vote near their university  not in their home towns. although the expected 5 may election would be during term time  students can vote by post. the electoral commission and national union of students are worried students in halls of residence can find it hard to register to vote. some hall wardens are reluctant to register students because of data protection fears - but students can get themselves registered. if the election is on 5 may  voters need to register by 11 march.    - the seats where the lib dems say student votes can swing the election for them are: bristol west  cardiff central  leeds north west  cambridge  manchester gorton  sheffield central  oxford east  newcastle-upon-tyne central  liverpool riverside  holborn and st pancras  oldham east and saddleworth  manchester withington  islington south and finsbury  birmingham yardley  surrey south west  taunton  orpington  haltemprice and howden  eastbourne  isle of wight  dorset west  bournemouth east  wells  canterbury  cities of london and westminster  bournemouth west  westmorland and lonsdale.,lib dem target student vote student decid fate mp seat next elect liber democrat leader charl kennedi claim parti say vote student win new seat poll figur assum student vote univers town fact may vote parent live lib dem say scrap univers fee win student support torus would also end fee labour say would cap peopl ambit lib dem name seat enough student take lib dem second place beat labour could go second beat torus launch campaign win student vote london school econom mr kennedi urg student make mark underlin lib dem plan scrap univers fee reintroduc mainten grant £ say topup fee put student univers especi poorer background realli right mani young peopl start life mortgagestyl debt hang round neck mr kennedi also say student want action environ see iraq war parti oppos defin issu labour push plan let univers charg fee £ year poorest student elig nonrepay support £ ahead mr kennedi launch labour spokesperson say like torus liber democrat would restrict access high educ put cap aspir close door student good grade restrict life ambit commit abandon labour target get yearold go high educ lib dem plan student would even studi near home conserv say would abolish univers tuition fee instead offer larg student loan commerci rate interest say lib dem polici would leav univers wholli depend incom goodwil chancellor shadow educ secretari tim collin thursday set new scheme vocat grant yearold tackl say crippl skill shortag lib dem analysi differ student could make elect chanc base student regist vote near univers home town although expect may elect would term time student vote post elector commiss nation union student worri student hall resid find hard regist vote hall warden reluct regist student data protect fear student get regist elect may voter need regist march seat lib dem say student vote swing elect bristol west cardiff central leed north west cambridg manchest gorton sheffield central oxford east newcastleupontyn central liverpool riversid holborn st pancra oldham east saddleworth manchest withington islington south finsburi birmingham yardley surrey south west taunton orpington haltempric howden eastbourn isl wight dorset west bournemouth east well canterburi citi london westminst bournemouth west westmorland lonsdal
240,1806,kelly trails new discipline power teachers could get more powers to remove unruly pupils from classes under a  zero tolerance  drive  education secretary ruth kelly has suggested.  ms kelly told the bbc progress had been made against severely disruptive children but parents were still worried about lower level problems. the minister also confirmed she received  spiritual support  from the catholic movement opus dei. but she denied her faith meant she would refuse key government jobs.  the conservatives have made school discipline one of their five priority areas in the run-up to the next general election. ms kelly is expected to announce her plans on the issue in the next fortnight. she told bbc one s breakfast with frost:  it is really important to support head teachers and teachers in tackling disruption in the classroom.  we have made huge progress on the really difficult cases  the pupils who have severely disruptive behaviour.   but quite rightly what teachers are concerned about and what parents are concerned about is that this lower level disruption that goes on in the classroom now is tackled.  i would like to see the teacher being able to remove disruptive children from the classroom completely and have either alternative provision within the school or indeed off the school and may be working together with other schools in a particular area to provide that provision.  it is thought the plans may distinguish between excluding pupils from schools and taking them out of mainstream classes. head teachers can currently exclude pupils who commit or threaten violence in school  who sexually abuse pupils or other people  who sell illegal drugs or who have persistent and malicious disruptive behaviour. ms kelly entered the cabinet last month in the reshuffle forced by the resignation of the then home secretary david blunkett. her links to opus dei  which means  work of god  in latin  have provoked controversy.  critics say the organisation  which adheres strictly to catholic teachings  is secretive and elitist but its members reject such claims. asked if she was a member of the group  ms kelly said:  i do have spiritual support from opus dei and that is right.  but those are private spiritual matters and i m sure you ll respect that politicians are entitled to a private life.  she categorically denied reports that her beliefs on issues such as contraception would make her refuse to serve as a health or international development minister. her collective responsibility as a cabinet minister meant she also took responsibility for policies in those areas  she argued.  the government has yet to issue its official response to the tomlinson review  which recommended absorbing existing exam qualifications into a diploma. ms kelly said reforms should build on gcses and a-levels. her comments did not impress tory shadow education secretary tim collins.  ruth kelly wants to ditch the tomlinson report on exam structures but has absolutely no idea what to put in its place   he said.  she also talks of improving discipline but cannot make her mind up how. this is an all talk agenda that lets down children  teachers and

242,1040,campaigners attack mtv  sleaze  mtv has been criticised for  incessant sleaze  by television indecency campaigners in the us.  the parents television council (ptc)  which monitors violence and sex on tv  said the cable music channel offered the  cheapest form  of programming. the group is at the forefront of a vociferous campaign to clean up american television. but a spokeswoman for mtv said it was  unfair and inaccurate  to single out mtv for criticism.  the ptc monitored mtv s output for 171 hours from 20 march to 27 march 2004  during the channel s spring break coverage. in its report - mtv smut peddlers: targeting kids with sex  drugs and alcohol - the ptc said it witnessed 3 056 flashes of nudity or sexual situations and 2 881 verbal references to sex. brent bozell  ptc president and conservative activist said:  mtv is blatantly selling raunchy sex to kids.  compared to broadcast television programmes aimed at adults  mtv s programming contains substantially more sex  foul language and violence - and mtv s shows are aimed at children as young as 12.  there s no question that tv influences the attitudes and perceptions of young viewers  and mtv is deliberately marketing its raunch to millions of innocent children.   the watchdog decided to look at mtv s programmes after janet jackson s infamous  wardrobe malfunction  at last year s super bowl. the breast-baring incident generated 500 000 complaints and cbs - which is owned by the same parent company as mtv - was quick to apologise. mtv spokeswoman jeannie kedas said the network follows the same standards as broadcasters and reflects the culture and what its viewers are interested in.  it s unfair and inaccurate to paint mtv with that brush of irresponsibility   she said.  we think it s underestimating young people s intellect and level of sophistication.  ms kedas also highlighted the fact mtv won an award in 2004 for the fight for your rights series that focused on issues such as sexual health and tolerance.,campaign attack mtv sleaz mtv criticis incess sleaz televis indec campaign u parent televis council ptc monitor violenc sex tv say cabl music channel offer cheapest form program group forefront vocifer campaign clean american televis spokeswoman mtv say unfair inaccur singl mtv critic ptc monitor mtv output hour march march channel spring break coverag report mtv smut peddler target kid sex drug alcohol ptc say wit flash nuditi sexual situat verbal refer sex brent bozel ptc presid conserv activist say mtv blatantli sell raunchi sex kid compar broadcast televis programm aim adult mtv program contain substanti sex foul languag violenc mtv show aim child young question tv influenc attitud percept young viewer mtv deliber market raunch million innoc child watchdog decid look mtv programm janet jackson infam wardrob malfunct last year super bowl breastbar incid gener complaint cb own parent compani mtv quick apologis mtv spokeswoman jeanni keda say network follow standard broadcast reflect cultur viewer interest unfair inaccur paint mtv brush irrespons say think underestim young peopl intellect level sophist m keda also highlight fact mtv award fight right seri focus issu sexual health toler

244,358,market unfazed by aurora setback as the aurora limped back to its dock on 20 january  a blizzard of photos and interviews seemed to add up to an unambiguous tale of woe.  the ship had another slice of bad luck to add to its history of health scares and technical trouble. and its owner  p&o cruises - now part of the huge us carnival corporation - was looking at a significant slice chopped off this year s profits and a potential pr fiasco. no-one  however  seems to have told the stock markets. the warning of a five-cent hit to 2005 earnings came just 24 hours after one of the world s biggest investment banks had upped its target for carnival s share price  from £35 to £36.20. other investors barely blinked  and by 1300 gmt carnival s shares in london were down a single penny  or 0.03%  at £32.26.  why the mismatch between the public perception and the market s response   the aurora issue had been an ongoing one for some time   says deutsche bank s simon champion.  it was clearly a source of uncertainty for the company - it was a long cruise  after all. but the stock market is very good at treating these issues as one-off events.   despite its string of bad luck  he pointed out  aurora is just one vessel in a large carnival fleet  the uk s p&o princess group having been merged into the much larger us firm in 2003. and generally speaking  carnival has a reputation for keeping its ships pretty much on schedule.  carnival has an incredibly strong track record   mr champion.  similarly  analysts expect the impact on the rest of the cruise business to be limited. the hundreds of disappointed passengers who have now had to give up the opportunity to spend the next three months on the aurora have got both a refund and a credit for another cruise. that should mitigate some of the pr risk  both for carnival and its main competitor  royal caribbean.  while not common  cancellations for technical reasons are not entirely unusual in the industry   wrote analysts from citigroup smith barney in a note to clients on friday.  moreover  such events typically have a limited impact on bookings and pricing for future cruises.  after all  the aurora incident may be big news in the uk - but for carnival customers elsewhere it s unlikely to make too much of a splash.  assuming that citigroup is right  and demand stays solid  the structure of the industry also works in carnival s favour. in the wake of p&o princess s takeover by carnival  the business is now to a great extent a duopoly. given the expense of building  outfitting and running a cruise ship   slowing supply growth  is a certainty  said david anders at merrill lynch on thursday. in other words  if you do want a cruise  your options are limited. and with carnival remaining the market leader  it looks set to keep selling the tickets - no matter what happens to the ill-fated aurora in the future.,market unfaz aurora setback aurora limp back dock januari blizzard photo interview seem add unambigu tale woe ship anoth slice bad luck add histori health scare technic troubl owner po cruis part huge u carniv corpor look signific slice chop year profit potenti pr fiasco noon howev seem told stock market warn fivec hit earn come hour one world big invest bank up target carniv share price £ £ investor bare blink gmt carniv share london singl penni £ mismatch public percept market respons aurora issu ongo one time say deutsch bank simon champion clearli sourc uncertainti compani long cruis stock market good treat issu oneoff event despit string bad luck point aurora one vessel larg carniv fleet uk po princess group merg much large u firm gener speak carniv reput keep ship pretti much schedul carniv incred strong track record mr champion similarli analyst expect impact rest cruis busi limit hundr disappoint passeng give opportun spend next three month aurora get refund credit anoth cruis mitig pr risk carniv main competitor royal caribbean common cancel technic reason entir unusu industri write analyst citigroup smith barney note client friday moreov event typic limit impact book price futur cruis aurora incid may big news uk carniv custom elsewher unlik make much splash assum citigroup right demand stay solid structur industri also work carniv favour wake po princess takeov carniv busi great extent duopoli give expens build outfit run cruis ship slow suppli growth certainti say david ander merril lynch thursday word want cruis option limit carniv remain market leader look set keep sell ticket matter happen illfat aurora futur

249,1437,us box office set for record high ticket sales at the us box office are predicted to break records this year  with figures expected to reach $9.4 billion  beating 2002 s all-time high.  overall figures could be dampened by the lack of a christmas hit like last year s oscar-winning lord of the rings. traditionally  ticket sales during the festive season account for 20% of the annual total. although admissions have actually fallen this year  the predicted high is down to increasing ticket prices. according to exhibitor relations president paul dergarabedian  the average cost of a cinema ticket could be as high as $6.25 in 2004  compared to $5.80 in 2002. this year some of the biggest hits such as the passion of the christ and fahrenheit 9/11 came from outside the major studios which are usually responsible for the key blockbusters.   many of the films that did well (with audiences) are not necessarily the films that made a lot of money   said mr dergarabedian. he added that surprise hits had come from some of the more art-house offerings such as napoleon dynamite and critical hit sideways. sony pictures  responsible for hits like spiderman 2 and the grudge  are expected to top domestic market share for the second time in three years  with $1 billion-plus in sales for the third consecutive year. sony pictures entertainment vice chairman. jeff blake said:  we had a really diverse slate this year  and... certainly we pulled off one of the surprises with grudge.  horror movie the grudge cost sony $10 million to make but brought in $110 million. it s the latest in a recent trend for hollywood studios to back the upper and lower ends of the market  whilst ignoring the middle. warner inc are likely to end the year in second place on market share with around $1.25 billion  with disney at number three.,u box offic set record high ticket sale u box offic predict break record year figur expect reach billion beat alltim high overal figur could dampen lack christma hit like last year oscarwin lord ring tradit ticket sale festiv season account annual total although admiss actual fall year predict high increas ticket price accord exhibitor relat presid paul dergarabedian averag cost cinema ticket could high compar year big hit passion christ fahrenheit come outsid major studio usual respons key blockbust mani film well audienc necessarili film make lot money say mr dergarabedian ad surpris hit come arthous offer napoleon dynamit critic hit sideway soni pictur respons hit like spiderman grudg expect top domest market share second time three year billionplu sale third consecut year soni pictur entertain vice chairman jeff blake say realli diver slate year certainli pull one surpris grudg horror movi grudg cost soni million make brought million late recent trend hollywood studio back upper low end market whilst ignor middl warner inc like end year second place market share around billion disney number three

252,1039,apple makes blogs reveal sources apple has won its legal fight to make three bloggers reveal who told them about unreleased products.  the bid to unmask the employees leaking information was launched in december 2004 following online articles about apple s asteroid product. now apple has won the right to see e-mail records from the three bloggers to root out the culprit. a lawyer for the three bloggers said the ruling set a dangerous precedent that could harm all news reporters.  apple s lawsuit accused anonymous people of stealing trade secrets about the asteroid music product and leaking them to the powerpage  apple insider and think secret websites. all three are apple fan sites that obsessively watch the iconic firm for information about future products. apple is notoriously secretive about upcoming products which gives any snippets of information about what it is working on all the more value. the lawsuit to reveal the names of the leakers was filed against the power page and apple insider sites.  the separate legal fight with think secret has yet to be resolved. in the ruling handed down this week by santa clara county superior court judge james kleinberg  apple can now get its hands on e-mail records from the bloggers  net providers. in making his ruling  judge kleinberg said that laws covering the divulging of trade secrets outweighed considerations of public interest. california has so-called  shield  laws which protect journalists from prosecution if what they are writing about can be shown to be in the public interest. the judge wrote:  ...it is not surprising that hundreds of thousands of  hits  on a website about apple have and will happen. but an interested public is not the same as the public interest . judge kleinberg said the question of whether the bloggers were journalists or not did not apply because laws governing the right to keep trade secrets confidential covered journalists  too. the electronic frontier foundation  which is acting as legal counsel for power page and apple insider  said the ruling had potentially wide implications.  anyone who reports on companies or the trade press should be concerned about this ruling   said eff lawyer kurt opsahl. mr opsahl said the eff was planning to appeal against the ruling because the bloggers were journalists and us federal laws stop net firms handing over copies of e-mail messages if the owner of that account does not give their consent.,appl make blog reveal sourc appl legal fight make three blogger reveal told unreleas product bid unmask employe leak inform launch decemb follow onlin articl appl asteroid product appl right see email record three blogger root culprit lawyer three blogger say rule set danger preced could harm news report appl lawsuit accus anonym peopl steal trade secret asteroid music product leak powerpag appl insid think secret websit three appl fan site ob watch icon firm inform futur product appl notori secret upcom product give snippet inform work valu lawsuit reveal name leaker file power page appl insid site separ legal fight think secret yet resolv rule hand week santa clara counti superior court judg jame kleinberg appl get hand email record blogger net provid make rule judg kleinberg say law cover divulg trade secret outweigh consider public interest california socal shield law protect journalist prosecut write show public interest judg write surpris hundr thousand hit websit appl happen interest public public interest judg kleinberg say question whether blogger journalist appli law govern right keep trade secret confidenti cover journalist electron frontier foundat act legal counsel power page appl insid say rule potenti wide implic anyon report compani trade press concern rule say eff lawyer kurt opsahl mr opsahl say eff plan appeal rule blogger journalist u feder law stop net firm hand copi email messag owner account give consent
253,495,arnesen denies rift with santini tottenham sporting director frank arnesen has denied that coach jacques santini resigned because of a clash of personalities at white hart lane.  there had been newspaper speculation that santini had felt undermined by arnesen s role at the club.  it is absolutely not true   arnesen told bbc radio five live.  there is only one thing that made him resign and that is his own personal problems.  he has talked to me recently and said this matter is absolutely for himself.  arnesen said he was unable to throw any light onto the problems that caused santini to quit after just 13 games in charge. he added:  jacques has never gone into exactly what it was. but i trust him in that; you have to accept it. i think we should respect it.   the plan is now that over the weekend we will have talks with the board and then on monday we will clarify the situation.  arnesen countered criticism at the timing of the announcement  coming less than 24 hours before tottenham s premiership fixture with charlton.  when it comes down to personal problems  i don t think we should talk about timing   he said. and he also denied reports that santini had been given a £3m pay-off.  that is absolute nonsense. he is the one who said  i will go  and so he went    said the spurs sporting director. tottenham s structure of having a sporting director working alongside a coach is based on a continental model and arnesen sees no reason why they should change it.   i have confidence in this structure. i am confident that we have started something here in july and i still have a lot of confidence in tottenham and what we are doing   he said. however  former spurs and england defender gary stevens said he would not be surprised if the system had caused a rift.  i think the problems go a lot deeper  between the director of football at white hart lane and santini   stevens told five live.  on paper they could have worked together. but frank arnesen was a very creative  forward-thinking and expansive player - whereas i think santini was very much the opposite  more a case of being organised  disciplined and happy not conceding goals.  that sort of arrangement can work if the two people have the same principles and ideals and work very closely. but it seems that has not happened.,arnesen deni rift santini tottenham sport director frank arnesen deni coach jacqu santini resign clash person white hart lane newspap specul santini felt undermin arnesen role club absolut true arnesen told bbc radio five live one thing make resign person problem talk recent say matter absolut arnesen say unabl throw light onto problem caus santini quit game charg ad jacqu never go exactli trust accept think respect plan weekend talk board monday clarifi situat arnesen counter critic time announc come less hour tottenham premiership fixtur charlton come person problem think talk time say also deni report santini give £m payoff absolut nonsens one say go go say spur sport director tottenham structur sport director work alongsid coach base continent model arnesen see reason chang confid structur confid start someth juli still lot confid tottenham say howev former spur england defend gari steven say would surpris system caus rift think problem go lot deeper director footbal white hart lane santini steven told five live paper could work togeth frank arnesen creativ forwardthink expans player wherea think santini much opposit case organis disciplin happi conced goal sort arrang work two peopl principl ideal work close seem happen
254,1149,council tax rise  reasonable  welsh councils should set their taxes at  reasonable levels  after being given an average funding increase of 6%  says the assembly government.  finance minister sue essex said it was a  good deal  for local government. the £3.2bn settlement includes the  full  £7.4m from the uk treasury announced by chancellor gordon brown. but opposition parties said rebanding of council taxes would mean steep rises. in addition  £13.4m will come from the business support grant - a scheme which enables local authorities to keep part of business rates. she said where spending rises were kept to around 5% she was  confident that councils will be able to set council taxes at reasonable levels.  the welsh local government association (wlga) had said on the eve of the announcement said that  significant  cuts to services may still be unavoidable. after the announcement wlga finance spokesman bob wellington  of torfaen  said it was vital that rises were minimsed.  a limited amount of money has come available but this is not the answer to our problems   said mr wellington.  it is vital that we start now to plan for future years and accept that resources will continue to reduce while pressures on services increase.  on monday  a delegation of north wales councils visited ms essex to lobby for increased funds. ms essex said:  i have listened to the views of local government and council tax payers and recognise the funding pressures and the concerns they have about council tax rises.  i have met a large number of local authorities in recent weeks and i am aware of the pressures on them to provide local services and keep down the level of council tax  particularly for those people to are moving up a band due to the revaluation of domestic properties.  she said council taxes could be kept at reasonable levels   even for those people who have moved up a band .  the settlement includes a rise in the grant to help councils with the most deprived communities and a 16.4% rise in capital expenditure support. ms essex said:  this is a good deal for local government  which will allow the well-managed councils of wales to develop their services and charge reasonable levels of council tax. it is now a matter for council leaders to manage their budgets at a local level.  plaid cymru s local government spokesman dai lloyd called the announcement  hugely disappointing . he said:  wales and its local authorities have been short changed yet again. this is not whinging as the labour assembly government so often claims - it is anger.   this will mean either a massive hike in council tax  massive cuts in services provided by councils  or both.  mike german  leader of the liberal democrats in the assembly  claimed that one in three homes were still likely to face council tax rises due to rebanding. mr german said:  i know from my discussions with welsh liberal democrat council leaders that they are doing their utmost to keep council tax to a minimum. but the random redistribution effect of rebanding...will create a great deal of difficulty.  conservative local government spokesman glyn davies said that for the minister to claim that the majority of council tax payers in wales should see very little change  is taking spin to the very verge of deception . he added:  around a third of welsh households have been re-valued upwards by at least one band and inevitably face increases into double figures.,council tax rise reason welsh council set tax reason level give averag fund increas say assembl govern financ minist sue essex say good deal local govern £bn settlement includ full £m uk treasuri announc chancellor gordon brown opposit parti say reband council tax would mean steep rise addit £m come busi support grant scheme enabl local author keep part busi rate say spend rise kept around confid council abl set council tax reason level welsh local govern associ wlga say eve announc say signific cut servic may still unavoid announc wlga financ spokesman bob wellington torfaen say vital rise minim limit amount money come avail answer problem say mr wellington vital start plan futur year accept resourc continu reduc pressur servic increas monday deleg north wale council visit m essex lobbi increas fund m essex say listen view local govern council tax payer recognis fund pressur concern council tax rise met larg number local author recent week awar pressur provid local servic keep level council tax particularli peopl move band due revalu domest properti say council tax could kept reason level even peopl move band settlement includ rise grant help council depriv commun rise capit expenditur support m essex say good deal local govern allow wellmanag council wale develop servic charg reason level council tax matter council leader manag budget local level plaid cymru local govern spokesman dai lloyd call announc huge disappoint say wale local author short chang yet whing labour assembl govern often claim anger mean either massiv hike council tax massiv cut servic provid council mike german leader liber democrat assembl claim one three home still like face council tax rise due reband mr german say know discus welsh liber democrat council leader utmost keep council tax minimum random redistribut effect rebandingwil creat great deal difficulti conserv local govern spokesman glyn davi say minist claim major council tax payer wale see littl chang take spin verg decept ad around third welsh household revalu upward least one band inevit face increas doubl figur
255,314,speech takes on search engines a scottish firm is looking to attract web surfers with a search engine that reads out results.  called speegle  it has the look and feel of a normal search engine  with the added feature of being able to read out the results. scottish speech technology firm cec systems launched the site in november. but experts have questioned whether talking search engines are of any real benefit to people with visual impairments.  the edinburgh-based firm cec has married speech technology with ever-popular internet search. the ability to search is becoming increasingly crucial to surfers baffled by the huge amount of information available on the web.  according to search engine ask jeeves  around 80% of surfers visit search engines as their first port of call on the net. people visiting speegle can select one of three voices to read the results of a query or summarise news stories from sources such as the bbc and reuters.  it is still a bit robotic and can make a few mistakes but we are never going to have completely natural sounding voices and it is not bad   said speegle founder gordon renton.  the system is ideal for people with blurred vision or for those that just want to search for something in the background while they do something else.  we are not saying that it will be suitable for totally blind people  although the royal national institute of the blind (rnib) is looking at the technology   he added. but julie howell  digital policy manager at the rnib  expressed doubts over whether speegle and similar sites added anything to blind people s experience of the web.  there are a whole lot of options like this springing up on the web and one has to think carefully about what the market is going to be   she said.  blind people have specialised screen readers available to them which will do the job these technologies do in a more sophisticated way   she added.  the site uses a technology dubbed panavox  which takes web text and converts it into synthesised speech. in the past speech technology has only been compatible with broadband because of the huge files it downloads but cec says its compression technology means it will also work on slower dial-up connections. visitors to speegle may notice that the look and feel of the site bears more than a passing resemblance to the better known  if silent  search engine google. google has no connection with speegle and the use of bright colours is simply to make the site more visible for those with visual impairments  said mr renton.  it is not a rip-off. we are doing something that google does not do and is not planning to do and there is truth in the saying that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery   he said. speegle is proving popular with those learning english in countries such as japan and china.  the site is bombarded by people just listening to the words. the repetition could be useful although they may all end up talking like robots   said mr renton.,speech take search engin scottish firm look attract web surfer search engin read result call speegl look feel normal search engin ad featur abl read result scottish speech technolog firm cec system launch site novemb expert question whether talk search engin real benefit peopl visual impair edinburghbas firm cec marri speech technolog everpopular internet search abil search becom increasingli crucial surfer baffl huge amount inform avail web accord search engin ask jeev around surfer visit search engin first port call net peopl visit speegl select one three voic read result queri summaris news stori sourc bbc reuter still bit robot make mistak never go complet natur sound voic bad say speegl founder gordon renton system ideal peopl blur vision want search someth background someth el say suitabl total blind peopl although royal nation institut blind rnib look technolog ad juli howel digit polici manag rnib express doubt whether speegl similar site ad anyth blind peopl experi web whole lot option like spring web one think care market go say blind peopl specialis screen reader avail job technolog sophist way ad site use technolog dub panavox take web text convert synthesis speech past speech technolog compat broadband huge file download cec say compress technolog mean also work slow dialup connect visitor speegl may notic look feel site bear pas resembl well know silent search engin googl googl connect speegl use bright colour simpli make site visibl visual impair say mr renton ripoff someth googl plan truth say imit sincerest form flatteri say speegl prove popular learn english countri japan china site bombard peopl listen word repetit could use although may end talk like robot say mr renton

258,1855,hitachi unveils  fastest robot  japanese electronics firm hitachi has unveiled its first humanoid robot  called emiew  to challenge honda s asimo and sony s qrio robots.  hitachi said the 1.3m (4.2ft) emiew was the world s quickest-moving robot yet. two wheel-based emiews  pal and chum  introduced themselves to reporters at a press conference in japan. the robots will be guests at the world expo later this month. sony and honda have both built sophisticated robots to show off developments in electronics. explaining why hitachi s emiew used wheels instead of feet  toshihiko horiuchi  from hitachi s mechanical engineering research laboratory  said:  we aimed to create a robot that could live and co-exist with people.   we want to make the robots useful for people ... if the robots moved slower than people  users would be frustrated.  emiew - excellent mobility and interactive existence as workmate - can move at 3.7m/h. its  wheel feet  resemble the bottom half of a segway scooter. with sensors on the head  waist  and near the wheels  pal and chum demonstrated how they could react to commands.  i want to be able to walk about in places like shinjuku and shibuya [shopping districts] in the future without bumping into people and cars   pal told reporters. hitachi said pal and chum  which have a vocabulary of about 100 words  could be  trained  for practical office and factory use in as little as five to six years.  robotics researchers have long been challenged by developing robots that walk in the gait of a human. at the recent aaas (american association for the advancement of science) annual meeting in washington dc  researchers showed off bipedal designs. the three designs  each built by a different research group  use the same principle to achieve a human-like gait.  sony and honda have both used humanoid robots  which are not commercially available  as a way of showing off computing power and engineering expertise. honda s asimo was  born  five years ago. since then  honda and sony s qrio have tried to trump each other with what the robots can do at various technology events. asimo  has visited the uk  germany  the czech republic  france and ireland as part of a world tour. sony s qrio has been singing  jogging and dancing in formation around the world too and was  until last year  the fastest robot on two legs. but its record was beaten by asimo. it is capable of 3km/h  which its makers claim is almost four times as fast as qrio. last year  car maker toyota also stepped into the ring and unveiled its trumpet-playing humanoid robot. by 2007  it is predicted that there will be almost 2.5 million  entertainment and leisure  robots in homes  compared to about 137 000 currently  according to the united nations (un). by the end of that year  4.1 million robots will be doing jobs in homes  said the report by the un economic commission for europe and the international federation of robotics. hitachi is one of the companies with home cleaning robot machines on the market.,hitachi unveil fast robot japanes electron firm hitachi unveil first humanoid robot call emiew challeng honda asimo soni qrio robot hitachi say m ft emiew world quickestmov robot yet two wheelbas emiew pal chum introduc report press confer japan robot guest world expo later month soni honda built sophist robot show develop electron explain hitachi emiew use wheel instead foot toshihiko horiuchi hitachi mechan engin research laboratori say aim creat robot could live coexist peopl want make robot use peopl robot move slow peopl user would frustrat emiew excel mobil interact exist workmat move mh wheel foot resembl bottom half segway scooter sensor head waist near wheel pal chum demonstr could react command want abl walk place like shinjuku shibuya shop district futur without bump peopl car pal told report hitachi say pal chum vocabulari word could train practic offic factori use littl five six year robot research long challeng develop robot walk gait human recent aaa american associ advanc scienc annual meet washington dc research show biped design three design built differ research group use principl achiev humanlik gait soni honda use humanoid robot commerci avail way show comput power engin expertis honda asimo born five year ago sinc honda soni qrio tri trump robot variou technolog event asimo visit uk germani czech republ franc ireland part world tour soni qrio sing jog danc format around world last year fast robot two leg record beaten asimo capabl kmh maker claim almost four time fast qrio last year car maker toyota also step ring unveil trumpetplay humanoid robot predict almost million entertain leisur robot home compar current accord unit nation un end year million robot job home say report un econom commiss europ intern feder robot hitachi one compani home clean robot machin market

261,718,child access laws shake-up parents who refuse to allow former partners contact with their children could be electronically tagged under plans being considered by ministers. curfews and community service orders were other options which could be used if court orders to allow parental access were defied  lord falconer said. the constitutional affairs secretary outlined some of the plans on tuesday. he denied fathers  activists had forced the changes  telling the bbc  there is a recognition that something is wrong . between 15 000 and 20 000 couples go to court to resolve access disputes each year  although in nine out of 10 separations there is no court intervention.  lord falconer told bbc radio 4 s today programme he hoped voluntary mediation could help solve disputes before they reached court. but he opposed compulsory mediation  saying that it would lead to many people taking part with the wrong attitude. other plans include:    - parenting plans to give advice on access arrangements  based on real-life examples that have worked in the past   - extending in-court conciliation - more informal hearings before contested court cases   - better access to legal  emotional and practical advice by telephone and internet   - legal aid changes to give incentives for early resolution of disputes.     judges can already jail parents who breach contact orders but that was a  nuclear option  which was rarely used as it was not seen as being in the child s interests  a spokesman said. the aim of the new legislation was to provide a  medium range  of penalties  such as fines  community service orders  compulsory anger management or parenting classes or curfews.  failure to comply with these measures could result in offenders being electronically tagged. on the possibility of tagging uncooperative parents  lord falconer said:  tagging may be going too far  but let s have a debate about that.  full details of the new powers will not be revealed until a bill is published  in the next two weeks   a spokesman said.  the government s proposals have met with disapproval from fathers  rights groups. john ison  from the controversial group fathers 4 justice  said:  it is very disappointing. what we have got is a cynical case of recycling existing legislation.  jim parton  from families need fathers  said the new proposals  lacked compulsion .   we would like to see couples develop a plan and then have it as a source of a court order - then you know where you stand  you know what the minimum access is.  otherwise  you see people make agreements which then fall apart.  mr parton said he had been told by children s minister margaret hodge there was not enough time to pass the bill through parliament before the general election  which is likely to take place in may.  the conservatives have called for an equal split between parents on access to be made law. theresa may  shadow secretary for the family  told bbc radio 4 s today programme that the government s plans were  inadequate  and were  papering over the cracks of the current system . she said a conservative government would bring a  radical reform  of the family courts  as well as enforcing a  legal presumption of co-parenting and compulsory mediation .  we want to make courts the last resort  rather than the first resort   she added. the government says children cannot simply be divided up  like property  when a marriage collapses. the liberal democrats have argued for flexibility in deciding access rules  rather than having  rigid targets .,child access law shakeup parent refus allow former partner contact child could electron tag plan consid minist curfew commun servic order option could use court order allow parent access defi lord falcon say constitut affair secretari outlin plan tuesday deni father activist forc chang tell bbc recognit someth wrong coupl go court resolv access disput year although nine separ court intervent lord falcon told bbc radio today programm hope voluntari mediat could help solv disput reach court oppos compulsori mediat say would lead mani peopl take part wrong attitud plan includ parent plan give advic access arrang base reallif exampl work past extend incourt concili inform hear contest court case well access legal emot practic advic telephon internet legal aid chang give incent earli resolut disput judg alreadi jail parent breach contact order nuclear option rare use see child interest spokesman say aim new legisl provid medium rang penalti fine commun servic order compulsori anger manag parent class curfew failur compli measur could result offend electron tag possibl tag uncoop parent lord falcon say tag may go far let debat full detail new power reveal bill publish next two week spokesman say govern propos met disapprov father right group john ison controversi group father justic say disappoint get cynic case recycl exist legisl jim parton famili need father say new propos lack compuls would like see coupl develop plan sourc court order know stand know minimum access otherwis see peopl make agreement fall apart mr parton say told child minist margaret hodg enough time pas bill parliament gener elect like take place may conserv call equal split parent access make law theresa may shadow secretari famili told bbc radio today programm govern plan inadequ paper crack current system say conserv govern would bring radic reform famili court well enforc legal presumpt copar compulsori mediat want make court last resort rather first resort ad govern say child simpli divid like properti marriag collaps liber democrat argu flexibl decid access rule rather rigid target

263,636,more power to the people says hp the digital revolution is focused on letting people tell and share their own stories  according to carly fiorina  chief of technology giant hewlett packard.  the job of firms such as hp now  she said in a speech at the consumer electronics show (ces)  was to ensure digital and physical worlds fully converged. she said the goal for 2005 was to make people the centre of technology. ces showcases 50 000 new gadgets that will be hitting the shelves in 2005. the tech-fest  the largest of its kind in the world  runs from 6 to 9 january.  the digital revolution is about the democratisation of technology and the experiences it makes possible   she told delegates.  revolution has always been about giving power to the people.  she added:  the real story of the digital revolution is not just new products  but the millions of experiences made possible and stories that millions can tell.  part of giving people more control has been about the freeing up of content  such as images  video and music. crucial to this has been the effort to make devices that speak to each other better so that content can be more easily transferred from one device  such as a digital camera  to others  such as portable media players. a lot of work still needs to be done  however  to sort out compatibility issues and standards within the technology industry so that gadgets just work seamlessly  she said.  ms fiorina s talk also touted the way technology is being designed to focus on lifestyle  fashion and personalisation  something she sees as key to what people want.  special guest  singer gwen stefani  joined her on-stage to promote her own range of hp digital cameras which ms stefani has helped design and which are heavily influenced by japanese youth culture. the digital cameras  which are due to go on sale in the us by the summer  are based on the hp 607 model. the emphasis on personalisation and lifestyle is a big theme at this year s ces  with tiny  wearable mp3 players at every turn and rainbow hues giving colour to everything. ms fiorina also announced that hp was working with nokia to launch a visual radio service for mobiles  which would launch in europe early this year. the service will let people listen to radio on their mobiles and download relevant content  like a track s ringtone  simultaneously. the service is designed to make mobile radio more interactive.  among the other new products she showcased was the digital media hub  a big upgrade to hp s digital entertainment centre. coming out in the autumn in the us  the box is a networked  high-definition tv  cable set-top box  digital video recorder and dvd recorder. it has a removable hard drive cartridge  memory card slots  and light scribe labelling software which lets people design and print customised dvd labels and covers. it is designed to contain all a household s digital media  such as pre-recorded tv shows  pictures  videos and music so it can all be managed in one place. the hub reflects the increasing move to re-box the pc so that it can work as part of other key centres of entertainment. research suggests that about 258 million images are saved and shared every day  equating to 94 billion a year. eighty per cent of those remain on cameras. media hubs are designed to encourage people to organise them on one box. ms fiorina was one of several keynote speakers  who also included microsoft chief bill gates  to set out what major technology companies think people will be doing with technologies and gadgets in the next 12 months. in a separate announcement during the keynote speech  ms fiorina said that hp would be partnering mtv to replace this year s mtv asia music award. mtv s asia aid will be held in bangkok on 3 february  and is aimed at helping to raise money for the asian tsunami disaster.,power peopl say hp digit revolut focus let peopl tell share stori accord carli fiorina chief technolog

264,1022,format wars could  confuse users  technology firms sony  philips  matsushita and samsung are developing a common way to stop people pirating digital music and video.  the firms want to make a system that ensures files play on the hardware they make but also thwarts illegal copying. the move could mean more confusion for consumers already faced by many different  and conflicting  content control systems  experts warned. they say there are no guarantees the system will even prevent piracy.  currently many online stores wrap up downloadable files in an own-brand control system that means they can only be played on a small number of media players. systems that limit what people can do with the files they download are known as digital rights management systems. by setting up the alliance to work on a common control system  the firms said they hope to end this current fragmentation of file formats. in a joint statement the firms said they wanted to let consumers enjoy  appropriately licensed video and music on any device  independent of how they originally obtained that content . the firms hope that it will also make it harder for consumers to make illegal copies of the music  movies and other digital content they have bought. called the marlin joint development association  the alliance will define basic specifications that every device made by the electronics firms will conform to. marlin will be built on technology from rights management firm intertrust as well as an earlier drm system developed by a group known as the coral consortium.  the move is widely seen as a way for the four firms to decide their own destiny on content control systems instead of having to sign up for those being pushed by apple and microsoft. confusingly for consumers  the technology that comes out of the alliance will sit alongside the content control systems of rival firms such as microsoft and apple.  in many ways the different drm systems are akin to the different physical formats  such as betamax and vhs  that consumers have seen in the past   said ian fogg  personal technology and broadband analyst at jupiter research.  the difference is that it is very fragmented   he said.  it s not a two-horse race  it s a five  six  seven or even eight-horse race  mr fogg said consumers had to be very careful when buying digital content to ensure that it would play on the devices they own. he said currently there were even incompatibilities within drm families. although initiatives such as microsoft s  plays for sure  program could help remove some of the uncertainty  he said  life was likely to be confusing for consumers for some time to come.  shelley taylor  analyst and author of a report about online music services  said the locks and limits on digital files were done to maximise the cash that firms can make from consumers. apple s itunes service was a perfect example of this  she said.  although itunes has been hugely successful  apple could not justify its existence if it did not help sell all those ipods   she said.  she said rampant competition between online music services  of which there are now 230 according to recent figures  could drive more openness and freer file formats.  it always works out that consumer needs win out in the long run   she said   and the services that win in the long run are the ones that listen to consumers earliest.  ms taylor said the limits legal download services place on files could help explain the continuing popularity of file-sharing systems that let people get hold of pirated pop.  people want portability   she said   and with peer-to-peer they have 100% portability.  cory doctorow  european co-ordinator for the electronic frontier foundation which campaigns for consumers on many cyber-rights issues  expressed doubts that the marlin system would achieve its aims.  not one of these systems has ever prevented piracy or illegal copying   he said. he said many firms readily admit that their drm systems are little protection against skilled attackers such as the organised crime gangs that are responsible for most piracy. instead  said mr doctorow  drm systems were intended to control the group that electronics firms have most hold over - consumers.  the studios and labels perceive an opportunity to sell you your media again and again - the ipod version  the auto version  the american and uk version  the ringtone version  and so on.,format war could confus user technolog firm soni philip matsushita samsung develop common way stop peopl pirat digit music video firm want make system ensur file play hardwar make also thwart illeg copi move could mean confus consum alreadi face mani differ conflict content control system expert warn say guarante system even prevent piraci current mani onlin store wrap download file ownbrand control system mean play small number medium player system limit peopl file download know digit right manag system set allianc work common control system firm say hope end current fragment file format joint statement firm say want let consum enjoy appropri licens video music devic independ origin obtain content firm hope also make harder consum make illeg copi music movi digit content bought call marlin joint develop associ allianc defin basic specif everi devic make electron firm conform marlin built technolog right manag firm intertrust well earlier drm system develop group know coral consortium move wide see way four firm decid destini content control system instead sign push appl microsoft confusingli consum technolog come allianc sit alongsid content control system rival firm microsoft appl mani way differ drm system akin differ physic format betamax vh consum see past say ian fogg person technolog broadband analyst jupit research differ fragment say twohors race five six seven even eighthors race mr fogg say consum care buy digit content ensur would play devic say current even incompat within drm famili although initi microsoft play sure program could help remov uncertainti say life like confus consum time come shelley taylor analyst author report onlin music servic say lock limit digit file do maximis cash firm make consum appl itun servic perfect exampl say although itun huge success appl could justifi exist help sell ipod say say rampant competit onlin music servic accord recent figur could drive open freer file format alway work consum need win long run say servic win long run one listen consum early m taylor say limit legal download servic place file could help explain continu popular fileshar system let peopl get hold pirat pop peopl want portabl say peertop portabl cori doctorow european coordin electron frontier foundat campaign consum mani cyberright issu express doubt marlin system would achiev aim one system ever prevent piraci illeg copi say say mani firm readili admit drm system littl protect skill attack organis crime gang respons piraci instead say mr doctorow drm system intend control group electron firm hold consum studio label perceiv opportun sell medium ipod version auto version american uk version rington version

268,1518,tory backing for id cards the tories are to back controversial government plans to introduce id cards.  the shadow cabinet revealed its support ahead of next week s commons vote on a bill to introduce compulsory id. the decision follows a  tough meeting  where some senior tories argued vociferously against the move  party sources told the bbc. the bill  which ministers claim will tackle crime  terrorism and illegal immigration  is expected to be opposed by the liberal democrats.  they have said the scheme is  deeply flawed  and a waste of money. sources within the conservative party told the bbc michael howard has always been in favour of id cards  and tried to introduce them when he was home secretary. the party has been  agnostic  on the issue until now but had now decided to come off the fence  the tory source said. despite giving their backing to id cards  the conservatives insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme.  they said they would also press labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the home office would deliver them. and they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of id cards and whether people s privacy would be properly protected.  it is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect   a spokesman said.  it will do nothing to solve the immediate problems of rising crime and uncontrolled immigration.   lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten said:  this has all the signs of michael howard overruling colleagues  concerns over id cards.  the tories should have the courage to try and change public opinion not follow it.  the new chairman of the bar council  guy mansfield qc warned there was a real risk that people on the  margins of society  would be driven into the hands of extremists.  what is going to happen to young asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere  they are going to be stopped. if they haven t [id cards] they are going to be detained.,torus back id card torus back controversi govern plan introduc id card shadow cabinet reveal support ahead next week common vote bill introduc compulsori id decis follow tough meet senior torus argu vocifer move parti sourc told bbc bill minist claim tackl crime terror illeg immigr expect oppos liber democrat say scheme deepli flaw wast money sourc within conserv parti told bbc michael howard alway favour id card tri introduc home secretari parti agnost issu decid come fenc torus sourc say despit give back id card conserv insist would hold minist account precis purpos scheme say would also press labour whether object could met whether home offic would deliv pledg ass cost effect id card whether peopl privaci would properli protect import rememb bill take decad come full effect spokesman say noth solv immedi problem rise crime uncontrol immigr lib dem home affair spokesman mark oaten say sign michael howard overrul colleagu concern id card torus courag tri chang public opinion follow new chairman bar council guy mansfield qc warn real risk peopl margin societi would driven hand extremist go happen young asian men bomb go somewher go stop id card go detain

272,1135,rolling out next generation s net the body that oversees how the net works  grows and evolves says it has coped well with its growth in the last 10 years  but it is just the start.   in a sense  we have hardly started in reaching the whole population   the new chair of the internet engineering task force (ietf)  brian carpenter  says. the ietf ensures the smooth running and organisation of the net s architecture. with broadband take-up growing  services like voice and tv will open up interesting challenges for the net.  i think voip (voice-over internet protocol  allowing phone calls to be made over the net) is very important - it challenges all the old cost models of telecoms   says dr carpenter.  second  it challenges more deeply the business model that you have to be a service provider with a lot of infrastructure. with voip  you need very little infrastructure.   a distinguished ibm engineer  dr carpenter spent 20 years at cern  the european laboratory for particle physics. as the new chair of the ietf  his next big challenge is overseeing ipv6  the next generation standard for information transfer and routing across the web. at cern  dr carpenter helped pioneer advanced net applications during the development of the world wide web  so he is well-placed to take on such a task. the net s growth and evolution depend on standards and protocols  and ensuring the architecture works and talks to other standards is a crucial job of the ietf. the top priority is to ensure that the standards that make the net work  are open and free for anyone to use and work with.  the net is built on a protocol called tcp/ip  which means transmission control protocol  and internet protocol. when computers communicate with the net  a unique ip address is used to send and receive information. the ietf is a large international community of network designers  operators  vendors  and researchers working on the evolution of the net s architecture and the way this information is sent and received. they make sure it all knits together leaving no gaps.  we ve seen some interesting effects over last few years   explains dr carpenter.  the net was growing at a fantastic rate at the end of the 90s. then there was a bit of a glitch in 2000.  we are now seeing a very clear phase of consolidation and renewed growth.   that renewed growth is also being buoyed by emerging economies  like china  which are showing fast uptake of broadband net and other technologies. the number of broadband subscribers via dsl (digital subscriber line) doubled in a year to 13 million  according to figures released at the end of 2004.  the challenges we face are about continuing to produce standards to allow for that growth rate   explained dr carpenter.  given it [the net] was designed for the whole community  it has done well to reach millions. if you want to reach the whole population  you have to make sure it can scale up.  ipv6  the standard that will replace the existing ipv4  will allow for billions more addresses on the net  and it is gradually being worked into network infrastructure across the world.  the actual number of addresses with ipv4 is limited to four billion ip addresses.  that clearly is not enough when you have 10 billion people to serve  so there is technical solution  the new version of ip - ipv6.  it has much larger address space possibilities with no practical limits   said dr carpenter. standards are vital to something as complex as the net  and making sure standards are open and can work with across networks is a big task. the difference this next generation standard  ipv6  will make to the average net user is almost invisible.  our first goal is that it [ipv6] should make no difference - people should not notice a difference.  it is like when the london telephone numbers got longer. a lot of the process will be invisible.  people are usually given an ip address without knowing it.  technically deployment has started and the standards for are just about settled  said dr carpenter.  the one problem with the net that may never disappear completely is security. to dr carpenter  the solution comes out of technological and human behaviour. people have to be educated about  sensible behaviour  he says  such as ignoring e-mails that claim you have won something.   i don t think it is going to get worse. people will remain concerned about security and they probably should do - just as you would be concerned walking along a dark street.  we have to do work to make sure there are better security internet standards. it is a never-ending battle in a sense.  but  he adds:  even if security has improved  you still worry a bit. unfortunately  it is just part of life. we have a duty to do what we can.,roll next gener net bodi overse net work grow evolv say cope well growth last year start sen hardli start reach whole popul new chair internet engin task forc ietf brian carpent say ietf ensur smooth run organis net architectur broadband takeup grow servic like voic tv open interest challeng net think voip voiceov internet protocol allow phone call make net import challeng old cost model telecom say dr carpent second challeng deepli busi model servic provid lot infrastructur voip need littl infrastructur distinguish ibm engin dr carpent spent year cern european laboratori particl physic new chair ietf next big challeng overse ipv next gener standard inform transfer rout across web cern dr carpent help pioneer advanc net applic develop world wide web wellplac take task net growth evolut depend standard protocol ensur architectur work talk standard crucial job ietf top prioriti ensur standard make net work open free anyon use work net built protocol call tcpip mean transmiss control protocol internet protocol comput commun net uniqu ip address use send receiv inform ietf larg intern commun network design oper vendor research work evolut net architectur way inform sent receiv make sure knit togeth leav gap see interest effect last year explain dr carpent net grow fantast rate end s bit glitch see clear phase consolid renew growth renew growth also buoy emerg economi like china show fast uptak broadband net technolog number broadband subscrib via dsl digit subscrib line doubl year million accord figur releas end challeng face continu produc standard allow growth rate explain dr carpent give net design whole commun do well reach million want reach whole popul make sure scale ipv standard replac exist ipv allow billion address net gradual work network infrastructur across world actual number address ipv limit four billion ip address clearli enough billion peopl serv technic solut new version ip ipv much large address space possibl practic limit say dr carpent standard vital someth complex net make sure standard open work across network big task differ next gener standard ipv make averag net user almost invis first goal ipv make differ peopl notic differ like london telephon number get longer lot process invis peopl usual give ip address without know technic deploy start standard settl say dr carpent one problem net may never disappear complet secur dr carpent solut come technolog human behaviour peopl educ sensibl behaviour say ignor email claim someth think go get wors peopl remain concern secur probabl would concern walk along dark street work make sure well secur internet standard neverend battl sen add even secur improv still worri bit unfortun part life duti
273,1440,moore questions captaincy brian moore believes the england captain should not be a full-back.  jason robinson has led the team during their opening three defeats in the six nations tournament  in the absence of fly-half jonny wilkinson. the world champions have struggled since the retirement of former captain martin johnson  a lock forward. and former england captain moore told the bbc:  full-backs are too far away from the action. that s not a reflection on robinson personally.  he added:  i just think the point of influence needs to move closer to the pack - which is  after all  where games usually start and finish.  moore says a lack of cohesion in the forwards is one of the reasons why england have lost against wales  france and ireland in this year s tournament.  assertiveness in the pack isn t there  we re not getting enough people into the breakdowns   he explained.  wer e not getting quick ball  which means the backs are being stifled. their creativity depends on quick ball and we re not getting that.   with injuries depriving him of key players like wilkinson  coach andy robinson has given youngsters such as harry ellis and jamie noon a chance. and moore believes the last two games against italy and scotland are a good opportunity to experiment further.  the problem is the players that are around to replace the icons which have been lost because of retirement and injury don t have the requisite experience   moore added.  you can t do anything about that but play them. there are players who have been knocking on the door  it s time for them to be looked at in these last two games because there s nothing on them.  we then go into next season with a greater certainty of who can and cannot handle the pressure of international rugby.,moor question captainci brian moor believ england captain fullback jason robinson lead team open three defeat six nation tournament absenc flyhalf jonni wilkinson world champion struggl sinc retir former captain martin johnson lock forward former england captain moor told bbc fullback far away action reflect robinson person ad think point influenc need move closer pack game usual start finish moor say lack cohes forward one reason england lose wale franc ireland year tournament assert pack get enough peopl breakdown explain wer e get quick ball mean back stifl creativ depend quick ball get injuri depriv key player like wilkinson coach andi robinson give youngster harri elli jami noon chanc moor believ last two game itali scotland good opportun experi problem player around replac icon lose retir injuri requisit experi moor ad anyth play player knock door time look last two game noth go next season great certainti handl pressur intern rugbi

275,1882,woolf murder sentence rethink plans to give murderers lighter sentences if they plead guilty have been watered down.  there was an outcry three months ago when the sentencing guidelines council - led by lord woolf - published its proposals for england and wales. it had suggested judges should reduce sentences by a third for murderers who confessed at the earliest opportunity. but that has now been changed to one-sixth  with no reduction for those killers given a  whole life tariff . at the time lord woolf  the lord chief justice  had said the one third reduction would only be in extraordinary circumstances - for example  if people gave themselves up before their crime had even been detected. the guidelines were to recognise the need to spare victims and witnesses the trauma of going to court where possible  by allowing lighter sentences for guilty pleas and co-operation  he said.  but director of the victims of crime trust  norman brennan  accused lord woolf of having an  arrogant contempt for victims of crime and the law-abiding public . the national association of probation officers said the move would be  political suicide . in revised proposals from the sentencing guidelines council (sgc)  the section on murder said possible reductions would have to be  weighed carefully  by a judge so they did not lead to  an inappropriately short sentence . where it was appropriate to reduce the minimum term having regard to a plea of guilty  the maximum reduction would be one sixth  and should never exceed five years  it said.  in a statement issued on wednesday lord woolf said:  i have no doubt that being able to call on the diverse backgrounds and experiences of all those that serve on the sgc has vastly improved the final guidelines.  i am confident  as a result  that judges will be better placed to deliver sentences which are effective both as punishments and deterrents to offending and reoffending.  director of public prosecutions  ken macdonald qc  who sits on the sgc  said the principle of discounting sentences to offenders for early guilty pleas is set down by parliament.  what the new guideline on reduced sentences for guilty pleas does is increase the chances of convicting the guilty by bringing clarity to this process.  it represents a tougher regime than existed previously  because the discount is automatically reduced if a guilty plea is not made at the first available opportunity   he said.,woolf murder sentenc rethink plan give murder lighter sentenc plead guilti water outcri three month ago sentenc guidelin council lead lord woolf publish propos england wale suggest judg reduc sentenc third murder confess early opportun chang onesixth reduct killer give whole life tariff time lord woolf lord chief justic say one third reduct would extraordinari circumst exampl peopl give crime even detect guidelin recognis need spare victim wit trauma go court possibl allow lighter sentenc guilti plea cooper say director victim crime trust norman brennan accus lord woolf arrog contempt victim crime lawabid public nation associ probat offic say move would polit suicid revis propos sentenc guidelin council sgc section murder say possibl reduct would weigh care judg lead inappropri short sentenc appropri reduc minimum term regard plea guilti maximum reduct would one sixth never exceed five year say statement issu wednesday lord woolf say doubt abl call diver background experi serv sgc vastli improv final guidelin confid result judg well place deliv sentenc effect punish deterr offend reoffend director public prosecut ken macdonald qc sit sgc say principl discount sentenc offend earli guilti plea set parliament new guidelin reduc sentenc guilti plea increas chanc convict guilti bring clariti process repres tougher regim exist previous discount automat reduc guilti plea make first avail opportun say
276,858,sella wants michalak recall former france centre philippe sella believes coach bernard laporte must recall frederic michalak to give his side any chance of beating ireland.  sella admitted he had been impressed by current fly-half yann delaigue in the rbs six nations to date. but he told bbc sport:  michalak is the answer both now and for the future. delaigue deserved his chance but the time has come to bring back michalak.  he does have weaknesses but has the all-round game to upset ireland.  the 22-year-old michalak has spent much of the tournament on the bench after delaigue impressed for castres early in the season. with michalak overlooked  the french stuttered to narrow wins over scotland and then england before ironically playing their best rugby in the defeat to wales.  the wales game was amazing to watch but never did i think the french could lose that game at half-time   said sella.   their only mistakes were that they didn t score enough points in the first half and were a little bit less focused in the second... but only a little bit.  sella  however  insisted the pressure had eased on the under-fire laporte  despite the defeat at the stade de france.  this season is very important for shaping a team for the 2007 world cup   said sella   which laporte is doing very well. the french get better every game.  it s difficult  though  when you change a team and you change your tactics as everything has to gel.  but he has the players and the talent to take them all the way to world cup victory.  as a result  it is important that people give him time. it may not seem good now that we re not winning the grand slam but no one will care in two years time if we re world champions.   the majority of media criticism centred on the way in which france produced a performance devoid of running rugby in their opening two games. but while sella admitted he liked the more flowing style employed against wales  he said  the win was most important .  winning is all that matters   he added.  ok  the flair may not have been so good  but the discipline  organisation and defence was there  which are all important ahead of 2007.  france play what sella believes is their hardest game of the six nations against ireland in dublin on saturday 12 march. the french go into the game as clear underdogs. but sella added:  people forget that france can still win the six nations and they ll be focused on that.  but ireland will be going for even more in front of their home crowd. it s going to be tough.,sella want michalak recal former franc centr philipp sella believ coach bernard laport must recal freder michalak give side chanc beat ireland sella admit impress current flyhalf yann delaigu rb six nation date told bbc sport michalak answer futur delaigu deserv chanc time come bring back michalak weak allround game upset ireland yearold michalak spent much tournament bench delaigu impress castr earli season michalak overlook french stutter narrow win scotland england iron play best rugbi defeat wale wale game amaz watch never think french could lose game halftim say sella mistak score enough point first half littl bit less focus second littl bit sella howev insist pressur ea underfir laport despit defeat stade de franc season import shape team world cup say sella laport well french get well everi game difficult though chang team chang tactic everyth gel player talent take way world cup victori result import peopl give time may seem good win grand slam one care two year time world champion major medium critic centr way franc produc perform devoid run rugbi open two game sella admit like flow style employ wale say win import win matter ad ok flair may good disciplin organis defenc import ahead franc play sella believ hardest game six nation ireland dublin saturday march french go game clear underdog sella ad peopl forget franc still win six nation focus ireland go even front home crowd go tough
277,119,chelsea denied by james heroics a brave defensive display  led by keeper david james  helped manchester city hold the leaders chelsea.  after a quiet opening  james denied damien duff  jiri jarosik and mateja kezman  while paul bosvelt cleared william gallas  header off the line. robbie fowler should have scored for the visitors but sent his header wide. chelsea had most of the possession in the second half but james kept out frank lampard s free-kick and superbly tipped the same player s volley wide. city went into the game with the proud record of being the only domestic team to beat chelsea this season. and there was little to alarm them in the first 30 minutes as chelsea - deprived of arjen robben and didier drogba through injury - struggled to pose much of a threat. indeed  it was the visitors who looked likelier to enliven a drab opening played at a lethargic pace. shaun wright-phillips - watched by england boss sven-goran eriksson - showed his customary trickery to burst into the right of the area and deliver a dangerous ball  which was blocked by john terry. but chelsea suddenly stepped up a gear and created a flurry of chances. first  duff got round ben thatcher and blasted in a shot that james parried to kezman  who turned the ball wide.  soon afterwards  jarosik found space in the area to powerfully head lampard s corner goalwards but james tipped the ball over. chelsea were now looking more like premiership leaders and james kept out kezman s fierce drive before bosvelt and james combined to clear gallas  header from duff s corner. city broke swiftly up the field and the last chance of a frenetic spell should have resulted in fowler celebrating his 150th premiership goal. wright-phillips raced down the left and crossed to fowler but city s lone man up front  left free by terry s slip  contrived to head wide when it seemed a breakthrough was certain. the second half started as quietly as the first  although james was forced to divert a cross from the lively duff away from eidur gudjohnsen s path. there was a nasty moment for petr cech  looking for a ninth straight clean sheet in the league  when a series of ricochets saw fowler chase a loose ball in the area and collide accidently with the czech republic stopper. another quiet spell followed  which duff interrupted with a surging run that was halted illegally on the edge of the penalty area by bosvelt. lampard stepped up to blast a shot through the wall and james somehow blocked it with his legs. another timely challenge  this time from richard dunne in time added on  prevented gudjohnsen from getting in a shot. there was still time for james to produce a sensational save to tip lampard s volley round the post.  cech  paulo ferreira  gallas  terry  bridge  jarosik (tiago 56)  lampard  makelele  duff  gudjohnsen  kezman (cole 63).  subs not used: johnson  smertin  cudicini.  makelele  gudjohnsen.  james  mills  distin  dunne  thatcher  shaun wright-phillips  bosvelt  barton  sibierski (mcmanaman 85)  musampa  fowler.  subs not used: macken  weaver  onuoha  jordan.  bosvelt.  42 093  h webb (s yorkshire).,chelsea deni jame heroic brave defens display lead keeper david jame help manchest citi hold leader chelsea quiet open jame deni damien duff jiri jarosik mateja kezman paul bosvelt clear william galla header line robbi fowler score visitor sent header wide chelsea posse second half jame kept frank lampard freekick superbl tip player volley wide citi go game proud record domest team beat chelsea season littl alarm first minut chelsea depriv arjen robben didier drogba injuri struggl pose much threat inde visitor look likeli enliven drab open play letharg pace shaun wrightphillip watch england bos svengoran eriksson show customari trickeri burst right area deliv danger ball block john terri chelsea suddenli step gear creat flurri chanc first duff get round ben thatcher blast shot jame parri kezman turn ball wide soon afterward jarosik found space area power head lampard corner goalward jame tip ball chelsea look like premiership leader jame kept kezman fierc drive bosvelt jame combin clear galla header duff corner citi broke swiftli field last chanc frenet spell result fowler celebr th premiership goal wrightphillip race left cross fowler citi lone man front left free terri slip contriv head wide seem breakthrough certain second half start quietli first although jame forc divert cross live duff away eidur gudjohnsen path nasti moment petr cech look ninth straight clean sheet leagu seri ricochet saw fowler chase loo ball area collid accid czech republ stopper anoth quiet spell follow duff interrupt surg run halt illeg edg penalti area bosvelt lampard step blast shot wall jame somehow block leg anoth time challeng time richard dunn time ad prevent gudjohnsen get shot still time jame produc sensat save tip lampard volley round post cech paulo ferreira galla terri bridg jarosik tiago lampard makelel duff gudjohnsen kezman cole sub use johnson smertin cudicini makelel gudjohnsen jame mill distin dunn thatcher shaun wrightphillip bosvelt barton sibierski mcmanaman musampa fowler sub use macken weaver onuoha jordan bosvelt h webb yorkshir

280,2110,court halts mark morrison album premiership footballer and record company boss kevin campbell has gained a court injunction stopping r&b singer mark morrison from releasing an album.  the everton striker signed morrison to his fledging 2 wikid records label and claims he spent thousands of pounds producing his album innocent man. now he is attempting to prevent morrison releasing the album on monday through another label. but morrison vowed to ignore the order  saying  no judge is gonna stop me .  morrison  who is now as well known for his brushes with the law than his music career  rose to fame with the 1996 single return of the mack.  but the leicester singer has struggled to repeat its success following two spells in jail. one was for hiring a stand-in to complete his community service for possession of a stun gun and three-months following a nightclub fracas. he signed to mr campbell s label a year ago and has released one single  with the label saying the album was due for release on 24 january. but mr campbell said he learned that morrison planned to release the album through jet star  which is advertising it on its website. mr campbell said:  i m glad we were granted the injunction but i m completely gutted that we have had to go that far.  mark morrison was given everything he asked for by 2 wikid but it seems that he couldn t help but return to his old ways.   i ve worked hard to realise my ambition in football but had hoped that my future career would be in the music business.  i have always dreamt of starting a record label but now mark morrison has spoilt that dream for me. there is no loyalty in this business - just greed.   but morrison is determined the album will be released on monday. he said:  the injunction is ludicrous.  i signed a new deal with a new record company because i was not getting the support i needed from 2 wikid.  i was with that label for a year and in that time released just one record  which was not properly promoted. he added:  the whole world is waiting for this album and it will come out on december 27. no injunction or judge will stop it. the mack will return.  the case is set to be heard in the high court on 20 december.,court halt mark morrison album premiership footbal record compani bos kevin campbel gain court injunct stop rb singer mark morrison releas album everton striker sign morrison fledg wikid record label claim spent thousand pound produc album innoc man attempt prevent morrison releas album monday anoth label morrison vow ignor order say judg gon na stop morrison well know brush law music career rise fame singl return mack leicest singer struggl repeat success follow two spell jail one hire standin complet commun servic posse stun gun threemonth follow nightclub fraca sign mr campbel label year ago releas one singl label say album due releas januari mr campbel say learn morrison plan releas album jet star advertis websit mr campbel say glad grant injunct complet gut go far mark morrison give everyth ask wikid seem help return old way work hard realis ambit footbal hope futur career would music busi alway dreamt start record label mark morrison spoilt dream loyalti busi greed morrison determin album releas monday say injunct ludicr sign new deal new record compani get support need wikid label year time releas one record properli promot ad whole world wait album come decemb injunct judg stop mack return case set heard high court decemb

282,241,retail sales show festive fervour uk retail sales were better than expected in november as christmas shoppers began their seasonal flock to the high street  figures show.  the office for national statistics (ons) said retail sales rose 0.6% on the month and 6.1% on the year. but the figures  along with this week s inflation report  could trigger another interest rate rise in the new year. however  recent data from the british retail consortium showed a 0.2% slip in high street sales during november.  the ons data confounded analyst expectations. many had expected sales to fall slightly in november as shoppers put off buying christmas presents until december. however  retailers  attempts to draw in the crowds may be behind november s unexpected rise in sales  they say. aggressive tactics  such as one-day discount sales adopted by stores such as marks & spencer  appear to have paid off.  price discounting has certainly accounted for much of this because the value of retail sales hasn t grown as much as volumes   said investec economist david page. the figures sparked a rally for sterling as the data supported the view that it is too early to assume that base rates have peaked.,retail sale show festiv fervour uk retail sale well expect novemb christma shopper begin season flock high street figur show offic nation statist on say retail sale rise month year figur along week inflat report could trigger anoth interest rate rise new year howev recent data british retail consortium show slip high street sale novemb on data confound analyst expect mani expect sale fall slightli novemb shopper put buy christma present decemb howev retail attempt draw crowd may behind novemb unexpect rise sale say aggress tactic oneday discount sale adopt store mark spencer appear paid price discount certainli account much valu retail sale grown much volum say investec economist david page figur spark ralli sterl data support view earli assum base rate peak
283,1696,new  yob  targets to be unveiled fifty new areas getting special help to fight anti-social behaviour in england and wales will be named on thursday.  ten areas have already had access to special prosecutors and local experts and the government is now expanding the crackdown to more towns and cities. details of how many anti-social behaviour orders (asbos) were used in the last year are also being published. labour sees nuisance behaviour as a key election issue but critics claim the record is at best patchy. a year ago  ministers launched their anti-social behaviour plan and thursday s figures offer a progress check. they will say that in the past year more than 2 600 anti-social behaviour orders were issued by the courts - more than double the total used in the previous four years.  police have also closed 150 crack houses and issued more than 400 dispersal orders  breaking up groups of youths in public places. the 50 new pilot areas to get special attention will also receive extra government funding. exeter and cardiff are among cities who have voiced interest in being involved.  prime minister tony blair is also expected to announce new measures to strengthen the use of asbos and fixed penalty notices. there are still concerns that some areas of the country are not using the powers properly.  he is expected to say that the new figures were heartening but he would not rest until similar action was taken in all areas of the country where it was needed.  we have not defeated this problem by any means  but shown together what can be done   he will say. mr blair this week defended the shake-up of the licensing laws  saying it was right to focus on troublemakers rather than treating everybody as a potential drunken nuisance.  ministers also boast of record police numbers and are speeding up plans to put in place 25 000 community support officers (csos). but researchers from leeds university warned that csos could undermine traditional bonds between police officers and communities. more work needed to be done on clarifying the role of different agencies and how they linked together before csos  they argued in a the study. critics of the government say it has announced more than 20 initiatives to tackle nuisance behaviour when the real focus should be on good policing. home office minister hazel blears also revealed this week that  about a third  of asbos were breached - with some people jailed and others not.,new yob target unveil fifti new area get special help fight antisoci behaviour england wale name thursday ten area alreadi access special prosecutor local expert govern expand crackdown town citi detail mani antisoci behaviour order asbo use last year also publish labour see nuisanc behaviour key elect issu critic claim record best patchi year ago minist launch antisoci behaviour plan thursday figur offer progress check say past year antisoci behaviour order issu court doubl total use previou four year polic also close crack hous issu dispers order break group youth public place new pilot area get special attent also receiv extra govern fund exet cardiff among citi voic interest involv prime minist toni blair also expect announc new measur strengthen use asbo fix penalti notic still concern area countri use power properli expect say new figur hearten would rest similar action take area countri need defeat problem mean show togeth do say mr blair week defend shakeup licens law say right focu troublemak rather treat everybodi potenti drunken nuisanc minist also boast record polic number speed plan put place commun support offic cso research leed univers warn cso could undermin tradit bond polic offic commun work need do clarifi role differ agenc link togeth cso argu studi critic govern say announc initi tackl nuisanc behaviour real focu good polic home offic minist hazel blear also reveal week third asbo breach peopl jail other

285,445,peugeot deal boosts mitsubishi struggling japanese car maker mitsubishi motors has struck a deal to supply french car maker peugeot with 30 000 sports utility vehicles (suv).  the two firms signed a memorandum of understanding  and say they expect to seal a final agreement by spring 2005. the alliance comes as a badly-needed boost for loss-making mitsubishi  after several profit warnings and poor sales. the suvs will be built in japan using peugeot s diesel engines and sold mainly in the european market. falling sales have left mitsubishi motors with underused capacity  and the production deal with peugeot gives it a chance to utilise some of it.  in january  mitsubishi motors issued its third profits warning in nine months  and cut its sales forecasts for the year to march 2005. its sales have slid 41% in the past year  catalysed by the revelation that the company had systematically been hiding records of faults and then secretly repairing vehicles. as a result  the japanese car maker has sought a series of financial bailouts. last month it said it was looking for a further 540bn yen ($5.2bn; £2.77bn) in fresh financial backing  half of it from other companies in the mitsubishi group. us-german carmaker daimlerchrylser  a 30% shareholder in mitsubishi motors  decided in april 2004 not to pump in any more money. the deal with peugeot was celebrated by mitsubishi s newly-appointed chief executive takashi nishioka  who took over after three top bosses stood down last month to shoulder responsibility for the firm s troubles. mitsubishi motors has forecast a net loss of 472bn yen in its current financial year to march 2005. last month  it signed a production agreement with japanese rival nissan motor to supply it with 36 000 small cars for sale in japan. it has been making cars for nissan since 2003.,peugeot deal boost mitsubishi struggl japanes car maker mitsubishi motor struck deal suppli french car maker peugeot sport util vehicl suv two firm sign memorandum understand say expect seal final agreement spring allianc come badlyneed boost lossmak mitsubishi sever profit warn poor sale suv built japan use peugeot diesel engin sell mainli european market fall sale left mitsubishi motor underus capac product deal peugeot give chanc utilis januari mitsubishi motor issu third profit warn nine month cut sale forecast year march sale slid past year catalys revel compani systemat hide record fault secretli repair vehicl result japanes car maker sought seri financi bailout last month say look bn yen bn £bn fresh financi back half compani mitsubishi group usgerman carmak daimlerchryls sharehold mitsubishi motor decid april pump money deal peugeot celebr mitsubishi newlyappoint chief execut takashi nishioka take three top bos stood last month shoulder respons firm troubl mitsubishi motor forecast net loss bn yen current financi year march last month sign product agreement japanes rival nissan motor suppli small car sale japan make car nissan sinc
286,1413,worldcom director admits lying the former chief financial officer at us telecoms firm worldcom has admitted before a new york court that he used to lie to fellow board members.  speaking at the trial of his former boss bernard ebbers  scott sullivan said he lied to the board to cover up the hole in worldcom s finances. mr ebbers is on trial for fraud and conspiracy in relation to worldcom s collapse in 2002. he pleads not guilty. the firm had been overstating its accounts by $11bn (£8.5bn). mr sullivan  42  has already pleaded guilty to fraud and will be sentenced following mr ebbers  trial  where he is appearing as a prosecution witness. mr ebbers  63  has always insisted that he was unaware of any hidden shortfalls in worldcom s finances.  in the new york court on wednesday  mr ebbers  lawyer reid weingarten asked mr sullivan:  if you believe something is in your interest  you are willing and able to lie to accomplish it  isn t that right     on that date  yes. i was lying   replied mr sullivan. mr weingarten has suggested that mr sullivan is implicating mr ebbers only to win a lighter sentence  something mr sullivan denies. mr sullivan also rejects a suggestion that he had once told fellow worldcom board member bert roberts that mr ebbers was unaware of the accounting fraud at worldcom. the trial of mr ebbers is now into its third week.  under 23 hours of questioning from a federal prosecutor  mr sullivan has previously told the court that he repeatedly warned mr ebbers that falsifying the books would be the only way to meet wall street revenue and earnings expectations. mr sullivan claims that mr ebbers refused to stop the fraud. mr ebbers could face a sentence of 85 years if convicted of all the charges he is facing. worldcom s problems appear to have begun with the collapse of the dotcom boom which cut its business from internet companies. prosecutors allege that the company s top executives responded by orchestrating massive fraud over a two-year period. worldcom emerged from bankruptcy protection in 2004  and is now known as mci.,worldcom director admit lie former chief financi offic u telecom firm worldcom admit new york court use lie fellow board member speak trial former bos bernard ebber scott sullivan say lie board cover hole worldcom financ mr ebber trial fraud conspiraci relat worldcom collaps plead guilti firm overst account bn £bn mr sullivan alreadi plead guilti fraud sentenc follow mr ebber trial appear prosecut wit mr ebber alway insist unawar hidden shortfal worldcom financ new york court wednesday mr ebber lawyer reid weingarten ask mr sullivan believ someth interest will abl lie accomplish right date ye lie repli mr sullivan mr weingarten suggest mr sullivan implic mr ebber win lighter sentenc someth mr sullivan deni mr sullivan also reject suggest told fellow worldcom board member bert robert mr ebber unawar account fraud worldcom trial mr ebber third week hour question feder prosecutor mr sullivan previous told court repeatedli warn mr ebber falsifi book would way meet wall street revenu earn expect mr sullivan claim mr ebber refus stop fraud mr ebber could face sentenc year convict charg face worldcom problem appear begin collaps dotcom boom cut busi internet compani prosecutor alleg compani top execut respond orchestr massiv fraud twoyear period worldcom emerg bankruptci protect know mci
287,1894,mobiles get set for visual radio the growth in the mobile phone market in the past decade has been nothing less than astonishing  but the ability to communicate on the go is not the only reason we are hooked. games  cameras and music players have all been added to our handsets in the last few years  but 2005 could see another big innovation that won t just see a change in our mobile phone habits - it might alter the way we listen to the radio. finnish handset giant nokia has been working on a technology called visual radio  which takes an existing fm signal from a radio station and enables that station to add enhancements such as information and pictures. it is not the first time that such an idea has been suggested - the early days of dab digital radio had similar intentions that never really saw the light of day.  one problem is that the name visual radio leads people to think of television but reidar wasenius  a senior project manager at nokia  was adamant that visual radio should not be confused with the more traditional medium. he said:  i m very happy to say it s not television  what we re talking about is an enhancement of radio as we know it today.  if you have a visual radio enabled handset  when you hear an artist you don t know  or there s a competition or vote that you d like to participate in  you pull out your handset and with one click you turn on a visual channel parallel to the on-air broadcast you ve just been listening to.   that visual channel is run from a computer within the radio station  and sends out different kinds of information to the handset depending on what you are listening to. as well as details on the track or artist of a particular song  there is also the ability to interact immediately with the radio station itself  in a similar way to digital television s  red button  content.  possible interactive content includes competitions  votes and even the chance to rate the song that is playing. but the interactive aspect will make the service especially attractive to radio stations  who will be able to track the number of people taking part in such activities on a real-time basis. this in turn should lead to an additional source of revenue  as it is very likely that advertisers will be keen to exploit new opportunities to reach listeners.  as the visual radio content is transmitted by existing gprs technology you would need to have that service enabled by your network. and there will be a cost for the service as well  although it may depend on your usage.  if you enjoy the visual channel occasionally and interact it ll be two or three pounds per month   said mr wasenius.  but typically what we see happening is the operator offering a package deal for an  all you can eat  arrangement per month.  the payment system could therefore be similar to the way that broadband internet works versus dial-up connections. one thing that is for sure - assuming that nokia retains its market share in handsets  it is estimating that there will be 100 million visual radio-enabled mobile phones in circulation by the end of 2006.  basically  visual radio is not really revolutionary  but rather an evolution where we are providing tools with which people can participate in radio much more easily than ever before.   the first visual radio service in the uk will begin in a few months time with virgin radio  who are positive about the impact it could have on their listeners. station manager steve taylor commented:  listeners can interact with the radio station in a new way.  not only does this give listeners more information on the music we play but means they can instantly purchase things they like; mp3 music downloads and the latest gig tickets.  initially visual radio functionality will be limited to two nokia handsets due out soon - the 3230 and 7710 - but if successful  it is very likely that other manufacturers will want to join them.  listen again to the interview on the radio five live website.,mobil get set visual radio growth mobil phone market past decad noth less astonish abil commun go reason hook game camera music player ad handset last year could see anoth big innov see chang mobil phone habit might alter way listen radio finnish handset giant nokia work technolog call visual radio take exist fm signal radio station enabl station add enhanc inform pictur first time idea suggest earli day dab digit radio similar intent never realli saw light day one problem name visual radio lead peopl think televis reidar waseniu senior project manag nokia adam visual radio confus tradit medium say happi say televis talk enhanc radio know today visual radio enabl handset hear artist know competit vote like particip pull handset one click turn visual channel parallel onair broadcast listen visual channel run comput within radio station send differ kind inform handset depend listen well detail track artist particular song also abil interact immedi radio station similar way digit televis red button content possibl interact content includ competit vote even chanc rate song play interact aspect make servic especi attract radio station abl track number peopl take part activ realtim basi turn lead addit sourc revenu like advertis keen exploit new opportun reach listen visual radio content transmit exist gpr technolog would need servic enabl network cost servic well although may depend usag enjoy visual channel occasion interact two three pound per month say mr waseniu typic see happen oper offer packag deal eat arrang per month payment system could therefor similar way broadband internet work versu dialup connect one thing sure assum nokia retain market share handset estim million visual radioen mobil phone circul end basic visual radio realli revolutionari rather evolut provid tool peopl particip radio much easili ever first visual radio servic uk begin month time virgin radio posit impact could listen station manag steve taylor comment listen interact radio station new way give listen inform music play mean instantli purchas thing like mp music download late gig ticket initi visual radio function limit two nokia handset due soon success like manufactur want join listen interview radio five live websit
288,1301,milburn defends poster campaign labour s election chief alan milburn has defended his party s campaign posters amid tory claims the ads were nothing short of  sly anti-semitism .  mr milburn said he appreciated people s concerns  but insisted that  what they were was anti-tory  and  not in any way  shape or form anti-semitic . he was responding to tory spokesman julian lewis who said the ads were part of a wider trend of smearing the party. labour has withdrawn two controversial posters and launched four new designs.  a row was sparked after the party published posters appearing to depict michael howard  who is jewish  as fagin  and as a flying pig  amid claims they were anti-semitic. the posters were labelled a  big misjudgement  by the conservatives who said labour s  first shot in the election has badly backfired .  the posters were among a series of ideas shown to labour members  who were asked to vote on their favourite. labour has taken them off its website  saying members preferred other posters. the party s four new designs  launched on tuesday  steer clear of the fagin or flying pig images  but make clear that labour is sticking to its strategy of targeting the tory leader personally  with reminders of his record in office.  the posters were among a series of ideas shown to labour members  who have been asked to choose which one should be used ahead of the election. in the commons  tory spokesman mr lewis suggested the posters were part of a wider trend and reminded mps that labour chairman ian mccartney last year described shadow chancellor oliver letwin as a  21st century fagin .   given the outrage that that smear caused then  how could you have thought anything other than the fact that what you were doing in reviving it in your poster advertisements was nothing more and nothing less than a calculated campaign of sly anti-semitism   mr milburn replied that they were not anti-semitic.  what they were was anti-tory and i make no apologies at all for making clear to the british public exactly what the conservative plans would mean   he said.  i fully understand and indeed respect the views of those who have concerns about any poster designs that have appeared on the labour party website.  the fagin and pigs might fly posters were taken off labour s website on monday after supporters voted for their favourite poster featuring mr howard and shadow chancellor oliver letwin holding a blackboard reading 2+2=5. a labour spokesman later said their removal from the party s website was not affected by the row.,milburn defend poster campaign labour elect chief alan milburn defend parti campaign poster amid torus claim ad noth short sli antisemit mr milburn say appreci peopl concern insist antitori way shape form antisemit respond torus spokesman julian lewi say ad part wider trend smear parti labour withdrawn two controversi poster launch four new design row spark parti publish poster appear depict michael howard jewish fagin fli pig amid claim antisemit poster label big misjudg conserv say labour first shot elect badli backfir poster among seri idea show labour member ask vote favourit labour take websit say member prefer poster parti four new design launch tuesday steer clear fagin fli pig imag make clear labour stick strategi target torus leader person remind record offic poster among seri idea show labour member ask choos one use ahead elect common torus spokesman mr lewi suggest poster part wider trend remind mp labour chairman ian mccartney last year describ shadow chancellor oliv letwin st centuri fagin give outrag smear caus could thought anyth fact reviv poster advertis noth noth less calcul campaign sli antisemit mr milburn repli antisemit antitori make apolog make clear british public exactli conserv plan would mean say fulli understand inde respect view concern poster design appear labour parti websit fagin pig might fli poster take labour websit monday support vote favourit poster featur mr howard shadow chancellor oliv letwin hold blackboard read labour spokesman later say remov parti websit affect row
289,226,fox  too reliant on reality tv  the head of us tv network fox has admitted the broadcaster had relied too heavily on reality tv shows such as the poor-rating who s your daddy.  chief executive gail berman said  in the case of this fall we drifted to too much on the unscripted side . the series who s your daddy  where a young woman tries to pick her natural father for a cash prize caused outrage from adoption groups and rated badly. last season  fox s prime-time audience fell by 600 000 to 5.9 million. ms berman said:  i think the audience expects loud things from fox. sometimes they work  and sometimes they don t.   who s your daddy  the first episode of which was shown on 3 january  pulled in a disappointing audience of 6.3 million  according to the nielsen ratings system. five other episodes of the show had also been filmed will be dropped from fox s schedules  ms berman said. she was predicting a drop in ratings even for some of the network s established reality shows  such as american idol  which is due to start its fourth series this week. fox had unveiled a new strategy last year promising to launch new shows every season  including the traditionally quiet summer season. though that had met with a poor reception  ms berman said  there s no question that the audience  in our mind  is ready  willing and able to accept new programming in the summer . fox has changed this plan  launching new shows in may instead of june. one of the new shows will be the animated series american dad  made by seth macfarlane  the creator of family guy. that series  after becoming a hit on dvd  is also set to return with new episodes.,fox reliant realiti tv head u tv network fox admit broadcast reli heavili realiti tv show poorrat daddi chief execut gail berman say case fall drift much unscript side seri daddi young woman tri pick natur father cash prize caus outrag adopt group rate badli last season fox primetim audienc fell million m berman say think audienc expect loud thing fox sometim work sometim daddi first episod show januari pull disappoint audienc million accord nielsen rate system five episod show also film drop fox schedul m berman say predict drop rate even network establish realiti show american idol due start fourth seri week fox unveil new strategi last year promis launch new show everi season includ tradit quiet summer season though met poor recept m berman say question audienc mind readi will abl accept new program summer fox chang plan launch new show may instead june one new show anim seri american dad make seth macfarlan creator famili guy seri becom hit dvd also set return new episod
290,1730,us prepares for hybrid onslaught sales of hybrid cars in the us are set to double in 2005  research suggests.  research group jd power estimates sales will hit 200 000 in 2005  despite higher prices and customer scepticism. carmakers are starting to build hybrid sports utility vehicles (suvs)  the four-wheel-drive vehicles which now dominate the us car market. hybrids cut both petrol consumption and emissions by combining a petrol engine with an electric motor constantly kept charged by extra engine power. several jurisdictions  notably the state of california  mandate low emissions for new cars. equally  the rise in oil prices over the past year has sparked hopes that consumers may be tempted by potential savings of a few hundred dollars a year on fuel.  at the detroit motor show  a range of manufacturers are prominently displaying their hybrid credentials. toyota has led the market to date with the prius  popularised by a number of celebrities keen to burnish their  green  credentials. in april it will launch a hybrid version of its highlander suv  with an suv from its luxury lexus marque due later in the year.  honda has three hybrids on the market  and between them the two japanese carmakers sold more than 80 000 units last year. ford  which has sold 4 000 of its first hybrid since its launch in august  is bringing a hybrid suv - the mariner - to market a year ahead of schedule  with plans for three more models by 2008. gm has a hybrid pickup on the market and is showing two concept suvs in detroit. even sports car maker porsche may join the race  although it insists it is still considering whether to hybridise its cayenne suv.  others remain more sceptical. nissan has bought toyota s hybrid technology  but plans to bring out its first model only in 2006.  we want to make sure we are not concentrating on one technology   nissan chief executive carlos ghosn said.  we will not be surprised by any acceleration or deceleration in the hybrid market.  volkswagen  meanwhile  says it will focus on clean-burning diesel engines instead. and some watchers point out that the price tag on a hybrid - upwards of $3 000 above that of an equivalent normal-engined car  and suspicion of the technology - may still cool its attraction.  the average consumers aren t willing to pay that premium for a car they won t drive more than six years   said anthony pratt from jd power.,u prepar hybrid onslaught sale hybrid car u set doubl research suggest research group jd power estim sale hit despit high price custom sceptic carmak start build hybrid sport util vehicl suv fourwheeldr vehicl domin u car market hybrid cut petrol consumpt emiss combin petrol engin electr motor constantli kept charg extra engin power sever jurisdict notabl state california mandat low emiss new car equal rise oil price past year spark hope consum may tempt potenti save hundr dollar year fuel detroit motor show rang manufactur promin display hybrid credenti toyota lead market date priu popularis number celebr keen burnish green credenti april launch hybrid version highland suv suv luxuri lexu marqu due later year honda three hybrid market two japanes carmak sell unit last year ford sell first hybrid sinc launch august bring hybrid suv marin market year ahead schedul plan three model gm hybrid pickup market show two concept suv detroit even sport car maker porsch may join race although insist still consid whether hybridis cayenn suv other remain sceptic nissan bought toyota hybrid technolog plan bring first model want make sure concentr one technolog nissan chief execut carlo ghosn say surpris acceler deceler hybrid market volkswagen meanwhil say focu cleanburn diesel engin instead watcher point price tag hybrid upward equival normalengin car suspicion technolog may still cool attract averag consum will pay premium car drive six year say anthoni pratt jd power
291,176,chinese exports rise 25% in 2004 exports from china leapt during 2004 over the previous year as the country continued to show breakneck growth.  the spurt put china s trade surplus - a sore point with some of its trading partners - at a six-year high. it may also increase pressure on china to relax the peg joining its currency  the yuan  with the weakening dollar. the figures released by the ministry of commerce come as china s tax chief confirmed that growth had topped 9% in 2004 for the second year in a row. state administration of taxation head xie xuren said a tightening of controls on tax evasion had combined with the rapid expansion to produce a 25.7% rise in tax revenues to 2.572 trillion yuan ($311bn; £165bn).  according to the ministry of commerce  china s exports totalled $63.8bn in december  taking the annual total up 35.4% to $593.4bn. with imports rising a similar amount  the deficit rose to $43.4bn. the increased tax take comes despite healthy tax rebates for many exporters totalling 420bn yuan in 2004  according to mr xie. china s exporting success has made the trade deficit of the united states soar even further and made trade with china a sensitive political issue in washington. the peg keeping the yuan around 8.30 to the dollar is often blamed by us lawmakers for job losses at home. a us report issued on tuesday on behalf of a congressionally-mandated panel said almost 1.5 million posts disappeared between 1989 and 2003. the pace accelerated in the final three years of the period  said the report for the us-china economic and security review commission  moving out of labour-intensive industries and into more hi-tech sectors. the us s overall trade deficit with china was $124bn in 2003  and is expected to rise to about $150bn for 2004.,chine export rise export china leapt previou year countri continu show breakneck growth spurt put china trade surplu sore point trade partner sixyear high may also increas pressur china relax peg join currenc yuan weaken dollar figur releas ministri commerc come china tax chief confirm growth top second year row state administr taxat head xie xuren say tighten control tax evas combin rapid expans produc rise tax revenu trillion yuan bn £bn accord ministri commerc china export total bn decemb take annual total bn import rise similar amount deficit rise bn increas tax take come despit healthi tax rebat mani export total bn yuan accord mr xie china export success make trade deficit unit state soar even make trade china sensit polit issu washington peg keep yuan around dollar often blame u lawmak job loss home u report issu tuesday behalf congressionallymand panel say almost million post disappear pace acceler final three year period say report uschina econom secur review commiss move labourintens industri hitech sector u overal trade deficit china bn expect rise bn

296,1701,california sets fines for spyware the makers of computer programs that secretly spy on what people do with their home pcs could face hefty fines in california.  from 1 january  a new law is being introduced to protect computer users from software known as spyware. the legislation  which was approved by governor arnold schwarzenegger  is designed to safeguard people from hackers and help protect their personal information. spyware is considered by computer experts to be one of the biggest nuisance and security threats facing pc users in the coming year. the software buries itself in computers and can collect a wide range of information. at its worst  it has the ability to hijack personal data  like passwords  login details and credit card numbers. the programs are so sophisticated they change frequently and become impossible to eradicate.  one form of spyware called adware has the ability to collect information on a computer user s web-surfing. it can result in people being bombarded with pop-up ads that are hard to close. in washington  congress has been debating four anti-spyware bills  but california is a step ahead. the state s consumer protection against spyware act bans the installation of software that takes control of another computer. it also requires companies and websites to disclose whether their systems will install spyware. consumers are able to seek up to $1 000 in damages if they think they have fallen victim to the intrusive software. the new law marks a continuing trend in california towards tougher privacy rights. a recent survey by earthlink and webroot found that 90% of pcs are infested with the surreptitious software and that  on average  each one is harbouring 28 separate spyware programs. currently users wanting protection from spyware have turned to free programs such as spybot and ad-aware.,california set fine spywar maker comput program secretli spi peopl home pc could face hefti fine california januari new law introduc protect comput user softwar know spywar legisl approv governor arnold schwarzenegg design safeguard peopl hacker help protect person inform spywar consid comput expert one big nuisanc secur threat face pc user come year softwar buri comput collect wide rang inform bad abil hijack person data like password login detail credit card number program sophist chang frequent becom imposs erad one form spywar call adwar abil collect inform comput user websurf result peopl bombard popup ad hard close washington congress debat four antispywar bill california step ahead state consum protect spywar act ban instal softwar take control anoth comput also requir compani websit disclos whether system instal spywar consum abl seek damag think fall victim intrus softwar new law mark continu trend california toward tougher privaci right recent survey earthlink webroot found pc infest surreptiti softwar averag one harbour separ spywar program current user want protect spywar turn free program spybot adawar

303,323,bank opts to leave rates on hold the bank of england has left interest rates on hold at 4.75% for a sixth month in a row.  the bank s monetary policy committee (mpc) decided to take no action amid mixed signals from the economy. but some economists predict a further rise in the cost of borrowing will come later this year. interest rates rose five times between november 2003 and august 2004 as soaring house prices and buoyant consumer data sparked inflation fears. bank of england governor mervyn king has recently warned against placing too much weight on one month s economic data  suggesting the mpc is waiting for a clearer picture to emerge. economists see next week s inflation report from the mpc as key in assessing whether a further interest rate rise is necessary to keep the economy in check.  slower consumer spending and a quieter housing market are likely to have convinced the mpc that rates should be left unchanged in recent months. inflation  however  has been rising faster than expected  hitting an annual rate of 1.6% in december - its highest level in six months. data on wednesday also showed manufacturing output rose at its fastest rate since may last month  reinforcing a view that economic growth was stronger than forecasts.  and recent house surveys from the halifax and nationwide have indicated prices are still rising  albeit at a slower pace than in recent years. philip shaw  chief economist at investec securities  said he believed rates would remain at 4.75% for the rest of the year although strong economic data could lead to a further hike.  the economic landscape has changed quite considerably over the last couple of months    he said.  growth appears stronger and the mpc may become more concerned about inflation trends.  howard archer  economist at global insight said the mpc  may well consider that the balance of risks to the growth and inflation outlook have moved from the downside to the upside .  business groups welcomed the mpc s widely-expected move to leave rates on hold and cautioned against further rises. the british chambers of commerce (bcc) said it was  concerned by the clamour in some quarters  for early interest rate increases.  we believe that these demands should be firmly resisted   said david frost  bcc director general.  manufacturing still faces extremely serious problems and is performing poorly  in spite of the recent revised figures.  ian mccafferty  chief economist at the cbi  said the mpc faced an  interesting  challenge.  consumers appear to have pulled in their horns over the holiday period  and exporters are struggling with the strength of sterling   he said.  however  the broader economy continues to show healthy growth  and the tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices are nudging inflation higher.,bank opt leav rate hold bank england left interest rate hold sixth month row bank monetari polici committe mpc decid take action amid mix signal economi economist predict rise cost borrow come later year interest rate rise five time novemb august soar hous price buoyant consum data spark inflat fear bank england governor mervyn king recent warn place much weight one month econom data suggest mpc wait clearer pictur emerg economist see next week inflat report mpc key ass whether interest rate rise necessari keep economi check slow consum spend quieter hous market like convinc mpc rate left unchang recent month inflat howev rise faster expect hit annual rate decemb high level six month data wednesday also show manufactur output rise fast rate sinc may last month reinforc view econom growth strong forecast recent hous survey halifax nationwid indic price still rise albeit slow pace recent year philip shaw chief economist investec secur say believ rate would remain rest year although strong econom data could lead hike econom landscap chang quit consider last coupl month say growth appear strong mpc may becom concern inflat trend howard archer economist global insight say mpc may well consid balanc risk growth inflat outlook move downsid upsid busi group welcom mpc widelyexpect move leav rate hold caution rise british chamber commerc bcc say concern clamour quarter earli interest rate increas believ demand firmli resist say david frost bcc director gener manufactur still face extrem seriou problem perform poorli spite recent revis figur ian mccafferti chief economist cbi say mpc face interest challeng consum appear pull horn holiday period export struggl strength sterl say howev broader economi continu show healthi growth tight labour market buoyant commod price nudg inflat high

310,456,uk net users leading tv downloads british tv viewers lead the trend of illegally downloading us shows from the net  according to research.  new episodes of 24  desperate housewives and six feet under  appear on the web hours after they are shown in the us  said a report. web tracking company envisional said 18% of downloaders were from within the uk and that downloads of tv programmes had increased by 150% in the last year. about 70% were using file-sharing program bittorrent  the firm said.  it s now as easy to download a pirate tv show as it is to programme a vcr   said ben coppin from envisional. a typical episode of 24 was downloaded by about 100 000 people globally  said the report  and an estimated 20 000 of those were from within the uk.  fans of many popular us tv programmes  like 24  usually have to wait weeks or months until the latest series is shown in the uk. but in some cases  said the report  people were able to watch the new episodes in britain before us audiences on the west coast of the country.  missing a television show presents little problem to anyone with a basic knowledge of the internet   explained mr coppin.   two clicks and your favourite programme is downloading. in effect  the internet is now a global video recorder.  exact figures are difficult to pin down  but it is thought that about 80 000 to 100 000 people in the uk download tv programmes. some may just want the odd episode  others are downloading regularly. many broadcast analysts agree that the net is radically altering the way people get content  like tv programmes. this presents a challenge to broadcasters who are concerned that channel schedules may become less important to people. it is also of concern to them because advertisements are usually cut out of the downloaded programmes. the industry has coined the term  time-shifting  to describe this trend of being able to watch what you want  when you want. the increased popularity of personal digital video recorders  tivo-type boxes which automatically record programmes like sky+  have also contributed to the trend. there are also numerous programs available on the net which automatically search and store tv programmes for viewers  effectively creating a personal video recorder on a computer.  within half an hour  recorded episodes can be uploaded - or posted - onto file-sharing networks or other download sites. because they tend to be shorter then full-length films  they can be processed - digitised - quickly. more people with high-speed broadband connections in the uk also means that episodes can be downloaded quickly.  according to jupiter research 40% of homes with broadband say it helps them pick and choose the programmes they want to see or that friends have recommended. the envisional reports said that the tv industry should consider offering a legal way to download shows. the bbc ran a trial of what it calls the interactive media player (imp) last year  which was based on a peer-to-peer distribution model. it let people download programmes it held the rights to up to eight days after they had already aired. it is looking to do a more expansive trial later this year. the bbc already allows radio fans to hear programmes they missed online up to a week after broadcast. about six million people in the uk now have a fast  always-on net connection via cable or phone lines.,uk net user lead tv download british tv viewer lead trend illeg download u show net accord research new episod desper housew six foot appear web hour show u say report web track compani envision say download within uk download tv programm increas last year use fileshar program bittorr firm say easi download pirat tv show programm vcr say ben coppin envision typic episod download peopl global say report estim within uk fan mani popular u tv programm like usual wait week month late seri show uk case say report peopl abl watch new episod britain u audienc west coast countri miss televis show present littl problem anyon basic knowledg internet explain mr coppin two click favourit programm download effect internet global video record exact figur difficult pin thought peopl uk download tv programm may want odd episod other download regularli mani broadcast analyst agre net radic alter way peopl get content like tv programm present challeng broadcast concern channel schedul may becom less import peopl also concern advertis usual cut download programm industri coin term timeshift describ trend abl watch want want increas popular person digit video record tivotyp box automat record programm like sky also contribut trend also numer program avail net automat search store tv programm viewer effect creat person video record comput within half hour record episod upload post onto fileshar network download site tend shorter fulllength film process digitis quickli peopl highspe broadband connect uk also mean episod download quickli accord jupit research home broadband say help pick choos programm want see friend recommend envision report say tv industri consid offer legal way download show bbc ran trial call interact medium player imp last year base peertop distribut model let peopl download programm held right eight day alreadi air look expans trial later year bbc alreadi allow radio fan hear programm miss onlin week broadcast six million peopl uk fast alwayson net connect via cabl phone line
311,1767,china  to overtake us net use  the chinese net-using population looks set to exceed that of the us in less than three years  says a report.  china s net users number 100m but this represents less than 8% of the country s 1.3 billion people. market analysts panlogic predicts that net users in china will exceed the 137 million us users of the net by 2008. the report says that the country s culture will mean that chinese people will use the net for very different ends than in many other nations.  already net use in china has a very different character than in many western nations  said william makower  chief executive of panlogic. in many western nations desktop computers that can access the net are hard to escape at work. by contrast in china workplace machines are relatively rare. this  combined with the relatively high cost of pcs in china and the time it takes to get phone lines installed  helps to explains the huge number of net cafes in china. only 36% of chinese homes have telephones according to reports.  net usage tends to happen in the evening   said mr makower   they get access only when they go home and go off to the internet caf&#233;.   its fundamentally different usage to what we have here   he said.  net use in china was still very much an urban phenomenon with most users living on the country s eastern seaboard or in its three biggest cities. the net is key to helping chinese people keep in touch with friends  said mr makower. many people use it in preference to the phone or arrange to meet up with friends at net cafes. what people can do on the net is also limited by aspects of chinese life. for instance  said mr makower  credit cards are rare in china partly because of fears people have about getting in to debt.  the most popular way to pay is cash-on-delivery   he said   and that s quite a brake to the development of e-commerce.  the arrival of foreign banks in china  due in 2006  could mean greater use of credit cards but for the moment they are rare  said mr makower. but if chinese people are not spending cash online they are interested in the news they can get via the net and the view it gives them on western ways of living.  a large part of the attraction of the internet is that it goes below the radar   he said.  generally it s more difficult for the government to be able to control it.   its real value is as an open window onto what s happening elsewhere in the world   he said. government restrictions on how much advertising can appear on television means that the net is a source of many commercial messages chinese people would not see anywhere else. familiarity with the net also has a certain social cachet.  it s a sign of them having made it that they can use the internet and navigate around it   said mr makower.,china overtak u net use chine netus popul look set exceed u less three year say report china net user number m repres less countri billion peopl market analyst panlog predict net user china exceed million u user net report say countri cultur mean chine peopl use net differ end mani nation alreadi net use china differ charact mani western nation say william makow chief execut panlog mani western nation desktop comput access net hard escap work contrast china workplac machin rel rare combin rel high cost pc china time take get phone line instal help explain huge number net cafe china chine home telephon accord report net usag tend happen even say mr makow get access go home go internet caf fundament differ usag say net use china still much urban phenomenon user live countri eastern seaboard three big citi net key help chine peopl keep touch friend say mr makow mani peopl use prefer phone arrang meet friend net cafe peopl net also limit aspect chine life instanc say mr makow credit card rare china partli fear peopl get debt popular way pay cashondeliveri say quit brake develop ecommerc arriv foreign bank china due could mean great use credit card moment rare say mr makow chine peopl spend cash onlin interest news get via net view give western way live larg part attract internet goe radar say gener difficult govern abl control real valu open window onto happen elsewher world say govern restrict much advertis appear televis mean net sourc mani commerci messag chine peopl would see anywher el familiar net also certain social cachet sign make use internet navig around say mr makow
312,1848,research fears over kelly s views scientists have expressed concerns that new education secretary ruth kelly s religious views could hamper vital scientific research.  ms kelly  who is catholic  is reported to be  pro-life  and has opposed embryo research. medical research council professor nancy rothwell said ms kelly s views mattered as she was responsible for training future scientists. the department for education and skills would not comment on the concerns.  a spokeswoman said:  it is not news that ms kelly is a catholic but we are not going into any details on this.  but she added that claims ms kelly was in charge of a £1bn university research budget were not true. it was down to the higher education funding council and the research councils to decide on universities  research allocations. british law is open to the cloning of human embryos to create stem cells  master cells that can develop into all the body s tissue types. this cloning activity is not permitted for reproductive purposes - only for research into new disease treatments. however  it is controversial because it involves the destruction of embryos.  professor rothwell  who is also vice-president of research at manchester university  told the times higher education supplement it would worry her  a great deal  if ministers were anti-stem cell. she said:  the views of ministers in the dfes do matter as they are responsible for training the next generation of scientists.  you can t have a higher education policy that is at odds with the government s science policy.  head of developmental genetics at the national institute of medical research  professor robin lovell-badge  said he had witnessed the confused situation in the us where many religious groups opposed the practice. he said:  if someone as senior as ruth kelly is not going to favour stem cell research we will end up with a similarly schizophrenic system in this country. it is very worrying.  but fertility expert lord winston said he thought it was  rather good  ministers held ethical views. concerns have also been raised by  pro-choice  organisations that ms kelly s views might affect sex education policy in schools.  family planning association chief executive  anne weyman  said teaching pupils about contraception and abortion were key.  young people must be informed about all the issues within sexual health  which include contraception and abortion.  i think it is very important that the government maintains its commitment to the teenage pregnancy strategy.  currently  individual schools devise their own sex education policies based on a framework provided by the dfes. ms kelly has not set out her detailed views on either issue yet  but has said she intends to put parents first in education policy. this would include the quality of teaching  classroom discipline and academic standards in schools  she said.,research fear kelli view scientist express concern new educ secretari ruth kelli religi view could hamper vital scientif research m kelli cathol report prolif oppos embryo research medic research council professor nanci rothwel say m kelli view matter respons train futur scientist depart educ skill would comment concern spokeswoman say news m kelli cathol go detail ad claim m kelli charg £bn univers research budget true high educ fund council research council decid univers research alloc british law open clone human embryo creat stem cell master cell develop bodi tissu type clone activ permit reproduct purpos research new diseas treatment howev controversi involv destruct embryo professor rothwel also vicepresid research manchest univers told time high educ supplement would worri great deal minist antistem cell say view minist dfe matter respons train next gener scientist high educ polici odd govern scienc polici head development genet nation institut medic research professor robin lovellbadg say wit confus situat u mani religi group oppos practic say someon senior ruth kelli go favour stem cell research end similarli schizophren system countri worri fertil expert lord winston say thought rather good minist held ethic view concern also rais prochoic organis m kelli view might affect sex educ polici school famili plan associ chief execut ann weyman say teach pupil contracept abort key young peopl must inform issu within sexual health includ contracept abort think import govern maintain commit teenag pregnanc strategi current individu school devi sex educ polici base framework provid dfe m kelli set detail view either issu yet say intend put parent first educ polici would includ qualiti teach classroom disciplin academ standard school say

314,1681,europe asks asia for euro help european leaders say asian states must let their currencies rise against the us dollar to ease pressure on the euro.  the european single currency has shot up to successive all-time highs against the dollar over the past few months. tacit approval from the white house for the weaker greenback  which could help counteract huge deficits  has helped trigger the move. but now europe says the euro has had enough  and asia must now share some of the burden.  china is seen as the main culprit  with exports soaring up 35% in 2004 partly on the back of a currency pegged to the dollar.  asia should engage in greater currency flexibility   said french finance minister herve gaymard  after a meeting with his german counterpart hans eichel. markets responded by pushing the euro lower  in the expectation that the rhetoric - and the pressure - is unlikely to ease ahead of a meeting of the g7 industrialised countries next week. early on tuesday morning  the dollar had edged higher to 1.3040 euros. the yen  meanwhile  had strengthened to 102.975 against the dollar by 0730 gmt.,europ ask asia euro help european leader say asian state must let currenc rise u dollar ea pressur euro european singl currenc shot success alltim high dollar past month tacit approv white hous weaker greenback could help counteract huge deficit help trigger move europ say euro enough asia must share burden china see main culprit export soar partli back currenc peg dollar asia engag great currenc flexibl say french financ minist herv gaymard meet german counterpart han eichel market respond push euro low expect rhetor pressur unlik ea ahead meet g industrialis countri next week earli tuesday morn dollar edg high euro yen meanwhil strengthen dollar gmt

317,130,williams battles to aussie title serena williams staged a remarkable recovery to beat lindsay davenport and win her second australian open title.  the 2003 champion claimed her seventh grand slam title  and her first since wimbledon in 2003  2-6 6-3 6-0. williams had looked close to quitting with a rib injury when she left the court for treatment after five games. she quickly dropped the first set but from 3-3 in the second found another gear as davenport s game collapsed  allowing williams to take the title. williams later explained her injury problem  saying it was the result of lunging for a ball early in the first set.  lindsay had me on the run out wide on my backhand and my back went but eventually i was able to come back  thank goodness   she said. davenport paid tribute to williams  saying:  she s had a tough couple of years and she s come back like a champion.   the 23-year-old former world number one was in desperate trouble in the early stages as the injury hampered her service action. davenport took advantage to race through the opening set and held six break points in game five of the second.  i kept thinking to myself  i m not losing this game   said williams afterwards.   i don t care if my arm falls off  i m not losing this game . and i guess that s what happened.  i didn t want to lose that particular game because it would have given her a lot of momentum  and a lot of confidence.  despite letting the break points slip away davenport looked comfortable enough at 3-3  but from 40-0 up she just folded. williams won nine consecutive points for the set and powered through the decider as a lacklustre davenport looked to have run out of energy after a gruelling two weeks.  i felt like i was playing well and in control pretty much of the match   said davenport.  then i just had that horrible lapse  i think serving up 40-0  and made a few errors and opened up the door for her and she just kept going through it.  at the end i think i was a little bit fatigued but she took advantage of it and kept going - she s a great frontrunner when she gets going.,william battl aussi titl serena william stage remark recoveri beat lindsay davenport win second australian open titl champion claim seventh grand slam titl first sinc wimbledon william look close quit rib injuri left court treatment five game quickli drop first set second found anoth gear davenport game collaps allow william take titl william later explain injuri problem say result lung ball earli first set lindsay run wide backhand back go eventu abl come back thank good say davenport paid tribut william say tough coupl year come back like champion yearold former world number one desper troubl earli stage injuri hamper servic action davenport take advantag race open set held six break point game five second kept think lose game say william afterward care arm fall lose game guess happen want lose particular game would give lot momentum lot confid despit let break point slip away davenport look comfort enough fold william nine consecut point set power decid lacklustr davenport look run energi gruell two week felt like play well control pretti much match say davenport horribl lap think serv make error open door kept go end think littl bit fatigu take advantag kept go great frontrunn get go
318,1831,tough rules for ringtone sellers firms that flout rules on how ringtones and other mobile extras are sold could be cut off from all uk phone networks.  the rules allow offenders to be cut off if they do not let consumers know exactly what they get for their money and how to turn off the services. the first month under the new rules has seen at least ten firms suspended while they clean up the way they work. the rules have been brought in to ensure that the problems plaguing net users do not spread to mobile phones.  in the last couple of years ringtones  wallpapers  screensavers and lots of other extras for phones have become hugely popular. but fierce competition is making it difficult for firms to get their wares in front of consumers  said jeremy flynn  head of third party services at vodafone.   if you are not on the operator s portal you are going to have quite heavy marketing costs because it s a problem of how people discover your services   he said. to combat this many ringtone and other mobile content sellers started using a new tactic to squeeze more cash out of customers. this tactic involved signing people up for a subscription to give them  for instance  several ringtones per week or month instead of the single track they thought they were getting. mr flynn said that the move to using subscriptions happened over the space of a few weeks at the end of 2004. websites such as grumbletext.co.uk started getting reports from customers who were racking up large bills for phone content they did not know they had signed up for.  what made us uncomfortable was that these services were not being marketed transparently   said mr flynn.  people did not know they were being offered a subscription service.   we saw potential for substantial consumer harm here   he added.  the swift adoption of subscription services led to the creation of a new code of conduct for firms that want to sell content for mobile phones. the drafting of the new rules was led by the mobile entertainment forum and the uk s phone firms.  everyone is required to conform to this code of conduct   said andrew bud  regulatory head of the mef and executive chairman of messaging firm mblox.   it s all about transparency   he said.  consumers have to be told what they have got themselves into and how to get out of it.   the consumer has a right to be protected   he said. christian harris  partnership manager of mobile content firm zed  said the new system was essential if consumers were to trust companies that sell ringtones and other downloads.  the groundrules must be applied across the whole industry and if that s done effectively we will see the cowboys driven out   he said. the new rules came in to force on 15 january and the first month under the new regime has seen many firms cautioned for not honouring them. some have been told to revamp websites so customers know what they get for their money and what they are signing up for  said mr flynn. also  said mr flynn  vodafone has briefly cut off between eight and ten content sellers flouting the rules.  we have quite draconian contracts with firms   he said.  we do not have to say why. we can just cut them off.  under the rules consumers must be able to switch off the services by using a universal  stop  command sent via text message. he said the system had been designed to limit how much a consumer will pay if they inadvertently signed up for a service.  the mobile is so personal that people really resent the abuse of what is effectively part of their personality   said mr flynn.,tough

326,2161,peer-to-peer nets  here to stay  peer-to-peer (p2p) networks are here to stay  and are on the verge of being exploited by commercial media firms  says a panel of industry experts.  once several high-profile legal cases against file-sharers are resolved this year  firms will be very keen to try and make money from p2p technology. the expert panel probed the future of p2p at the consumer electronics show in las vegas earlier in january. the first convictions for p2p piracy were handed out in the us in january. william trowbridge and michael chicoine pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music  movies and software. since the first successful file-sharing network napster was forced to close down  the entertainment industry has been nervous and critical of p2p technology  blaming it for falling sales and piracy. but that is going to change very soon  according to the panel.  the music and film industries have started some big legal cases against owners of legitimate p2p networks - which are not illegal in themselves - and of individuals accused of distributing pirated content over networks. but they have slowly realised that p2p is a good way to distribute content  said travis kalanick  founder and chairman of p2p network red swoosh  and soon they are all going to want a slice of it. they are just waiting to come up with  business models  that work for them  which includes digital rights management and copy-protection standards.  but  until the legal actions are resolved  experimentation with p2p cannot not happen  said michael weiss  president of streamcast networks. remembering the furore around vcrs when they first came out  mr weiss said:  old media always tries to stop new media.  when they can t stop it  they try to control it. then they figure out how to make money and they always make a lot of money.  once the courts decided that the vcr in itself was not an illegal technology  the film studios turned it into an extremely lucrative business. in august 2004  the san francisco-based us court of appeals ruled in favour of grokster and streamcast  two file-sharing networks. the court said they were essentially in the same position that sony was in the 1980s vcr battle  and said that the networks themselves could not be deemed as illegal.  p2p networks usually do not rely on dedicated servers for the transfer of files. instead it uses direct connections between computers - or clients. there are now many different types of p2p systems than work in different ways. p2p nets can be used to share any kind of file  like photos  free software  licensed music and any other digital content. the bbc has already decided to embrace the technology. it aims to offer most of its own programmes for download this year and it will use p2p technology to distribute them. the files would be locked seven days after a programme aired making rights management easier to control. but the technology is still demonised and misunderstood by many. the global entertainment industry says more than 2.6 billion copyrighted music files are downloaded every month  and about half a million films are downloaded a day. legal music download services  like apple itunes  napster  have rushed into the music marketplace to try and lure file-sharers away from free content. sales of legally-downloaded songs grew tenfold in 2004  with 200 million tracks bought online in the us and europe in 12 months  the ifpi reported this week. but such download services are very different from p2p networks  not least because of the financial aspect.  there are several money-spinning models that could turn p2p into a golden egg for commercial entertainment companies. paid-for-pass-along  in which firms receive money each time a file is shared  along with various drm solutions and advertiser-based options are all being considered.  we see there are going to be different models for commoditising p2p   said marc morgenstern  vice president of anti-piracy firm overpeer.   consumers are hungry for it and we will discover new models together   agreed mr morgenstern. but many net users will continue to ignore the entertainment industry s potential controlling grip on content and p2p technology by continuing to use it for their own creations. unsigned bands  for example  use p2p networks to distribute their music effectively  which also draws the attention of record companies looking for new artists to sign.  increasingly  what you are seeing on p2p is consumer-created content   said derek broes  from microsoft.  they will probably play an increasing role in helping p2p spread   he said. looking into p2p s future  file sharing is just the beginning for p2p networks  as far as mr broes is concerned.  once some of these issues are resolved  you are going to see aggressive movement to protect content  but also in ways that are unimaginable now   he said.  file-sharing is the tip of the iceberg.,peertop net stay peertop pp network stay verg exploit commerci medium firm say panel industri expert sever highprofil legal case fileshar resolv year firm keen tri make money pp

329,774,blackburn v burnley ewood park  tuesday  1 march  2000 gmt  howard webb (south yorkshire)  home to leicester in the quarter-finals  but defender andy todd is suspended and could be replaced by dominic matteo - if he recovers from a hamstring injury. burnley have major injury concerns over frank sinclair and john mcgreal. michael duff looks set to continue at right-back with john oster in midfield and micah hyde is expected to recover from a knee injury.  - blackburn boss mark hughes:  burnley are resolute and have individual talent but i fully expect us to progress.  i thought we were comfortable in the first game and never thought we were under pressure.  it s a competition we want to progress in and we are doing okay. if we beat burnley  we have a home tie against another lower league club (leicester).    - burnley boss steve cotterill:  they will be fresh and we ll be tired. that is an honest opinion but our lads just might be able to get themselves up for one more big game.  the atmosphere at the last game was very hot - a good verbal contest.  our fans will not need whipping up for this game. i just want them to help us as much as they can in a positive way.  key match stats   - blackburn rovers against bolton is part two of an east lancashire hotpot that didn t turn out to be that spicy when first staged on a sunday lunchtime the weekend before last  and resulted in a scrappy goalless draw.   - rovers  who are aiming to win the cup for a seventh time in their history and first time in 77 years  face another replay against championship opposition after eventually disposing of cardiff at ewood park in the third round. but they ve not been beaten in the competition by a club outside the premiership for nine years  since ipswich - then in the second tier - defeated them 0-1 after extra time in a third round replay at ewood park on 16 january 1996. history is on rovers side. when they last met their near neighbours in the fa cup 45 years ago  it also required an ewood park replay  which the home side won 2-0  and when they last met in the league  rovers did the double. they first won their nationwide division one trip to turf moor 0-2 four seasons ago  and then thrashed the clarets on home soil 5-0.   - manager mark hughes  who won the cup four times as a player  is aiming to steer rovers into the quarter-finals for the second time in 12 years  and first time since the 2000/2001 season. success here  and victory home to leicester in the next round  could see rovers in the semi-finals without having played premiership opposition.   - burnley make the eight mile journey to their fierce rivals  determined to send blackburn the same way as liverpool in the third round. but having failed to pull off another shock at turf moor  it could be that the championship outfit - 17 places inferior on the league ladder - have missed their best opportunity. having said that  burnley are yet to concede a goal in this cup run.   - steve cotterills  clarets have been knocked out in the fifth round four times in the last seven years  and have made only one appearance in the sixth round in 21 years. that was in the season before last  when they disposed of premiership fulham at this fifth round stage.   - while blackburn have not played since the fifth round tie  burnley have had two league outings away from home  drawing 1-1 at derby and losing 1-0 at preston. that takes their winless run to four games. the combatants from one-time prosperous mill towns  are both founder members of the football league. head to head  16th prem  winners (six times)  13th championship  winners (once),blackburn v burnley ewood park tuesday march gmt howard webb south yorkshir home leicest quarterfin defend andi todd suspend could replac domin matteo recov hamstr injuri burnley major injuri concern frank sinclair john mcgreal michael duff look set continu rightback john oster midfield micah hyde expect recov knee injuri blackburn bos mark hugh burnley resolut individu talent fulli expect u progress thought comfort first game never thought pressur competit want progress okay beat burnley home tie anoth low leagu club leicest burnley bos steve cotteril fresh tire honest opinion lad might abl get one big game atmospher last game hot good verbal contest fan need whip game want help u much posit way key match stat blackburn rover bolton part two east lancashir hotpot turn spici first stage sunday lunchtim weekend last result scrappi goalless draw rover aim win cup seventh time histori first time year face anoth replay championship opposit eventu dispos cardiff ewood park third round beaten competit club outsid premiership nine year sinc ipswich second tier defeat extra time third round replay ewood park januari histori rover side last met near neighbour fa cup year ago also requir ewood park replay home side last met leagu rover doubl first nationwid divis one trip turf moor four season ago thrash claret home soil manag mark hugh cup four time player aim steer rover quarterfin second time year first time sinc season success victori home leicest next round could see rover semifin without play premiership opposit burnley make eight mile journey fierc rival determin send blackburn way liverpool third round fail pull anoth shock turf moor could championship outfit place inferior leagu ladder miss best opportun say burnley yet conced goal cup run steve cotteril claret knock fifth round four time last seven year make one appear sixth round year season last dispos premiership fulham fifth round stage blackburn play sinc fifth round tie burnley two leagu out away home draw derbi lose preston take winless run four game combat onetim prosper mill town founder member footbal leagu head head th prem winner six time th championship winner

331,1934,fears raised over ballet future fewer children in the uk are following in the dainty footsteps of dancers like darcey bussell  and carving out potential careers as ballet dancers.  new research from the royal academy of dance (rad) has found fewer children over the age of 10 are attending ballet classes and taking exams in the discipline. the organisation blames the growing popularity of computer games and other changes in lifestyle. and there are fears that if the trend is not reversed  there could be fewer british ballet stars in the future. the rad found that the number of youngsters taking their ballet exams drops by almost 70% after the age of 10 or 11. dance teacher eve trew  who has taught ballet for over 48 years  told bbc news she had seen a  vast  change over the years. she blamed modern lifestyles for the fall in ballet attendance.  i think the children of many years ago did not have as many hobbies   she said.  the trouble now is that they are wide open to computers  gameboys and everything else children have got.  as a result  there is less time being spent on ballet lessons.   hazel gilbert  23  an information manager from newcastle  gave up ballet at the age of 10 and is typical of the problem.  it s not a very cool thing to do when you go to  big  school and i think you have to be very focused on ballet to want to carry on doing it   she said.  i used to love it  but after a certain age it becomes much more disciplined and i didn t want that.  i started getting into other things  like swimming and kickboxing  and ballet just wasn t something i wanted to do any more.  ms trew  who runs a dance school in gateshead  admitted it would be  very difficult  to reverse the trend and said many young ballet dancers were no longer willing to make the sacrifices to succeed.  you have to be very dedicated and you have to be very disciplined.  it is a career that you have got to really want to do because it is such hard work.  children these days have not got the time to spend perfecting it... that is very sad.   currently  only two out of 16 principal dancers at the royal ballet - darcey bussell and jonathan cope - are british  compared to 16 of the 21 principals in 1985. but a spokesman for the english national ballet told bbc news that although only two out of their 12 principal dancers were british  around a quarter of the company s dancers were from the uk. he said competition at open auditions in london was  fierce  between talented dancers from all over the world. the rad have launched a new competition to try and reverse the decline in british ballet. dame antoinette sibley  president of the rad  launched the fonteyn nureyev young dancers competition earlier this week.  aimed at children aged 10 to 13  it is hoped the contest will help keep british ballet evolving. a spokeswoman for the rad said:  it is our responsibility to re-ignite the passion and nurture young dancers for the long-term future of ballet.  we need to provide them with a framework and a goal to work towards  with constant support and coaching in an environment where they can work with their peers and possibly leading artists and choreographers.  perhaps more importantly provide them with the opportunity to experience  performance  themselves.  what better way to reignite a passion for ballet than to let them experience the thrill of performance,fear rais ballet futur few child uk follow dainti footstep dancer like darcey bussel carv potenti career ballet dancer new research royal academi danc rad found few child age attend ballet class take exam disciplin organis blame grow popular comput game chang lifestyl fear trend revers could few british ballet star futur rad found number youngster take ballet exam drop almost age danc teacher eve trew taught ballet year told bbc news see vast chang year blame modern lifestyl fall ballet attend think child mani year ago mani hobbi say troubl wide open comput gameboy everyth el child get result less time spent ballet lesson hazel gilbert inform manag newcastl give ballet age typic problem cool thing go big school think focus ballet want carri say use love certain age becom much disciplin want start get thing like swim kickbox ballet someth want m trew run danc school gateshead admit would difficult revers trend say mani young ballet dancer longer will make sacrific succeed dedic disciplin career get realli want hard work child day get time spend perfect sad current two princip dancer royal ballet darcey bussel jonathan cope british compar princip spokesman english nation ballet told bbc news although two princip dancer british around quarter compani dancer uk say competit open audit london fierc talent dancer world rad launch new competit tri revers declin british ballet dame antoinett sibley presid rad launch fonteyn nureyev young dancer competit earlier week aim child age hope contest help keep british ballet evolv spokeswoman rad say respons reignit passion nurtur young dancer longterm futur ballet need provid framework goal work toward constant support coach environ work peer possibl lead artist choreograph perhap importantli provid opportun experi perform well way reignit passion ballet let experi thrill perform

335,1392,manufacturing recovery  slowing  uk manufacturing grew at its slowest pace in one-and-a-half years in january  according to a survey.  the chartered institute of purchasing and supply (cips) said its purchasing manager index (pmi) fell to 51.8 from a revised 53.3 in december. but  despite missing forecasts of 53.7  the pmi number remained above 50 - indicating expansion in the sector. the cips said that the strong pound had dented exports while rising oil and metals prices had kept costs high.  the survey added that rising input prices and cooling demand had deterred factory managers from hiring new workers in an effort to cut costs. that triggered the second successive monthly fall in the cips employment index to 48.3 - its lowest level since june 2003. the survey is more upbeat than official figures - which suggest that manufacturing is in recession - but analysts said the survey did suggest that the manufacturing recovery was running out of steam.  it appears that the uk is in a two-tier economy again   said prebon yamane economist lena komileva.  you have weakness in manufacturing  which i think would concern policymakers at the bank of england.,manufactur recoveri slow uk manufactur grow slowest pace oneandahalf year januari accord survey charter institut purchas suppli cip say purchas manag index pmi fell revis decemb despit miss forecast pmi number remain indic expans sector cip say strong pound dent export rise oil metal price kept cost high survey ad rise input price cool demand deter factori manag hire new worker effort cut cost trigger second success monthli fall cip employ index low level sinc june survey upbeat offici figur suggest manufactur recess analyst say survey suggest manufactur recoveri run steam appear uk twotier economi say prebon yaman economist lena komileva weak manufactur think would concern policymak bank england

338,1723,$1m payoff for former shell boss shell is to pay $1m (£522 000) to the ex-finance chief who stepped down from her post in april 2004 after the firm over-stated its reserves.  judy boynton finally left the firm on 31 december  having spent the intervening time as a special advisor to chief executive jeroen van der veer. in january 2004  shell told shocked investors that its reserves were 20% smaller than previously thought. shell said the pay-off was in line with ms boynton s contract. she was leaving  by mutual agreement to pursue other career opportunities   the firm said in a statement. the severance package means she keeps long-term share options  but fails to collect on a 2003 incentive plan since the firm has failed to meet the targets included in it.  the revelation that shell had inflated its reserves led to the resignation of its chairman  sir phil watts  and production chief walter van der vijver.  an investigation commissioned by shell found that ms boynton had to share responsibility for the company s behaviour. despite receiving an email from mr van de vijver which said the firm had  fooled  the market about its reserves  the investigation said  she did nothing to inquire further. in all  shell restated its reserves four times during 2003. in september  it paid £82.7m in fines to regulators on both sides of the atlantic for violating market rules in its reporting of its reserves.,m payoff former shell bos shell pay m £ exfin chief step post april firm overst reserv judi boynton final left firm decemb spent interven time special advisor chief execut jeroen van der veer januari shell told shock investor reserv small previous thought shell say payoff line m boynton contract leav mutual agreement pursu career opportun firm say statement sever packag mean keep longterm share option fail collect incent plan sinc firm fail meet target includ revel shell inflat reserv lead resign chairman sir phil watt product chief walter van der vijver investig commiss shell found m boynton share respons compani behaviour despit receiv email mr van de vijver say firm fool market reserv investig say noth inquir shell restat reserv four time septemb paid £m fine regul side atlant violat market rule report reserv

even if i m not quite sure yet who that person is.  the us government denied the claims  saying it condemned and prohibited torture. in a statement  it said:  the department of defense has no doubt that mr mubanga was properly detained as an enemy combatant under the laws of war.  he was detained to prevent him from fighting against the us and our allies in the war on terror.  but fair trials abroad director stephen jakobi said there were similarities between mr mubanga s account and those of other guantanamo detainees. he said:  the pattern is the same. the real problem is the concentration camp conditions in guantanamo.  is [charles clarke] really pretending this is all made up   mr mubanga and the three other freed british detainees were released without charge by uk police on their return from cuba.,guantanamo man su govern british terror suspect held guantanamo bay month plan sue govern report martin mubanga claim observ mi offic play key role consign u camp cuba follow arrest zambia mr mubanga wembley london say brutal interrog daub urin camp home secretari say would launch investig medium report well inform mr mubanga dual british zambian nation one four briton releas u camp januari say sent interrog british man say mi shortli arrest zambia march mr mubanga say afghanistan pakistan studi islam say unabl return uk lose british passport travel zambian passport instead mr mubanga say mi agent told passport found cave afghanistan along document list jewish group new york suggest alqaeda reconnaiss mission mr mubanga say man american femal defenc offici tri recruit agent refus within three week told would sent guantanamo bay lawyer louis christian say hope issu proceed misfeas offici collud american effect kidnap take guantanamo menzi campbel liber democrat foreign affair spokesman say vital establish whether minist approv mr mubanga transfer guantanamo foreign offic spokesman say could comment activ british intellig secur agenc home secretari charl clark told bbc one breakfast frost organis specif investig mr mubanga first four detaine freed last month give medium interview told observ bad moment told would releas last march confin told would mani year claim strip cloth mattress forc remain empti metal box nake except boxer short say interrog use mop daub urin chain hand foot mr mubanga insist feel bitter say lose three year life muslim ad author want break strengthen make even quit sure yet person u govern deni claim say condemn prohibit tortur statement say depart defens doubt mr mubanga properli detain enemi combat law war detain prevent fight u alli war terror fair trial abroad director stephen jakobi say similar mr mubanga account guantanamo detaine say pattern real problem concentr camp condit guantanamo charl clark realli pretend make mr mubanga three freed british detaine releas without charg uk polic return cuba

341,78,hodgson relishes european clashes former blackburn boss roy hodgson says the premiership should follow the rest of europe and have a winter break - but insists that a gruelling domestic schedule will not damage the english elite s bid for champions league glory.  hodgson - now in charge at viking stavanger - was at liverpool s clash with bayer leverkusen at anfield on tuesday as a member of uefa s technical committee. hodgson is a fierce advocate of the winter break employed throughout europe  although not in england - where the champions league contenders have ploughed through a heavy fixture list. but hodgson told bbc sport that while he believes the premiership should embrace the idea  he does not expect it to cost the english representatives in the last 16 of the champions league.  i just feel it is very difficult to say with certainty that teams who have had the break will have a definite edge.  i am a fervent supporter of the break. it gives players the chance to recharge their batteries midway through the season  which some suggest will give teams an advantage in the champions league.  the other school of thought suggests having a break then coming back to it puts you at a disadvantage.  the bigger discussions around the winter break should be to do with the nature of football today  the needs of football players and the way the premiership has developed  rather than one or two matches in the champions league in february.  hodgson believes a winter break carries many advantages  explaining:  as i said  it is the perfect chance to recharge batteries.   and certainly if i was still a manager in england i would be supporting any calls for its introduction.  in pre-season you get a lot of enthusiasm and energy but by the time you get towards christmas many players  having also played plenty of international matches for club and country and travelled a lot  find themselves getting very jaded.  the break gives them a chance to recover that energy and enthusiasm and  perhaps more importantly  recover their mental strength during the break and get ready for the games ahead.  the mental side is by far the most important thing.  hodgson added:  the length of breaks can vary. in italy the break was very short. you just took christmas and new year.  it was so short you didn t do anything. you gave the players a week or 10 days off  then you were training for a week or 10 days and then went into a game.  if it is longer  it is important those responsible for physical fitness give the players a programme to follow to ensure the physical strength they have accumulated stays with them.  and hodgson believes a winter break would be a positive step in the premiership. he said:  if we talk about football at elite level  which the premiership is  then i would support a winter break.  if you examine the demands of the premier league and  in particular on players who play international football for their club and country  then a break would do them the world of good - physically and mentally.,hodgson relish european clash former blackburn bos roy hodgson say premiership follow rest europ winter break insist gruell domest schedul damag english elit bid champion leagu glori hodgson charg vike stavang liverpool clash bayer leverkusen anfield tuesday member uefa technic committe hodgson fierc advoc winter break employ throughout europ although england champion leagu contend plough heavi fixtur list hodgson told bbc sport believ premiership embrac idea expect cost english repres last champion leagu feel difficult say certainti team break definit edg fervent support break give player chanc recharg batteri midway season suggest give team advantag champion leagu school thought suggest break come back put disadvantag big discus around winter break natur footbal today need footbal player way premiership develop rather one two match champion leagu februari hodgson believ winter break carri mani advantag explain say perfect chanc recharg batteri certainli still manag england would support call introduct preseason get lot enthusiasm energi time get toward christma mani player also play plenti intern match club countri travel lot find get jade break give chanc recov energi enthusiasm perhap importantli recov mental strength break get readi game ahead mental side far import thing hodgson ad length break vari itali break short take christma new year short anyth give player week day train week day go game longer import respons physic fit give player programm follow ensur physic strength accumul stay hodgson believ winter break would posit step premiership say talk footbal elit level premiership would support winter break examin demand premier leagu particular player play intern footbal club countri break would world good physic mental

349,289,brown targets oaps and homebuyers gordon brown has doubled the level at which house buyers pay stamp duty to £120 000 as he put the economy at the heart of labour s election campaign.  the chancellor also unveiled a one-off £200 council tax refund for pensioners and a rise in child tax credit. mr brown put 1p a pint on beer  4p on a bottle of wine and 7p on 20 cigarettes but froze petrol duty until september. the tories called it a  vote now  pay later  budget. the lib dems branded it a  sticking plaster  for the election.  tory leader michael howard predicted the budget would do nothing to help labour s  faltering  election campaign.   this government and this chancellor have run out of solutions to the problems britain faces   mr howard told mps.  their only answer is to tax  to spend and to waste - to get people to vote now and pay later.  he ended his response with an election challenge to labour  saying  bring it on . liberal democrat leader charles kennedy attacked mr brown for failing to mention the environment and for his record on social justice.  how can it be right in britain today that the poorest 20% pay more in tax  as a proportion of their income  than the richest 20%   he asked.  mr kennedy criticised mr brown for failing to mention the  ticking bomb  of council tax revaluation  saying it was  high time  the system was replaced by a  local tax based on the ability to pay . during his 49 minute speech mr brown told mps he had defied the pundits by hitting his growth target of 3.1% for 2004.  he said his budget struck a balance  between tax cuts that are affordable  investments that are essential and stability that is paramount . he rejected across-the-board tax cuts in favour of targeted help for families. the child tax credit will rise in line with earnings  giving families an extra £5 a week. in contrast  the personal income tax allowance will rise only in line with inflation from £4 745 to £4 895 next month. mr brown told mps child benefit would rise to a maximum of £63 a week for the first child and £111 for two children. despite his giveaways  budget documents show mr brown clawed back £265m through a clampdown on tax avoidance and increased revenue from a windfall tax on oil companies. he also scrapped stamp duty relief for commercial property in disadvantaged areas - a measure brought in just over three years ago. bbc political editor andrew marr suggested the sweeteners were not big enough to have a transforming effect on voters. but trust in mr brown s economic stewardship would be a central election issue  he said.  mr brown also unveiled plans for a memorial to the queen mother  funded through a special coin to celebrate the queen s 80th birthday. other measures include equal tax status for same-sex couples and a deal with the council of mortgage lenders to boost low cost home ownership. the level where people start paying inheritance tax will also rise from £263 000 to £275 000 from april. mr brown said he had met his financial  golden rule  with a £6bn surplus and he said public borrowing would continue to fall over the next five years.  the economy had grown for 50 consecutive quarters  he said  and was forecast to continue doing so over the next year  with a forecast of 3% to 3.5% in 2005 and 2.5% to 3% in 2006. the first £2bn of value-for-money savings identified in the gershon review have been achieved  the chancellor said. some 12 500 civil servant posts have been axed  and 7 800 relocated out of the south east of england  he added. snp leader alex salmond said mr brown had failed the  tartan test  as there were no measures to boost the scottish economy. simon thomas  of plaid cymru  called it a budget for middle england. uk independence party leader roger knapman attacked the plans for pensioners saying they needed  more money and the dignity of being allowed to spend it how they want   not  free bus rides . the green party said the budget was a  wasted opportunity  for environmental protection  adding:  brown obviously has an eye on the coming election  and has taken his eye off the needs of the planet.,brown target oap homebuy gordon brown doubl level hous buyer pay stamp duti £ put economi heart labour elect campaign chancellor also unveil oneoff £ council tax refund pension rise child tax credit mr brown put p pint beer p bottl wine p cigarett froze petrol duti septemb torus call vote pay later budget lib dem brand stick plaster elect torus leader michael howard predict budget would noth help labour falter elect campaign govern chancellor run solut problem britain face mr howard told mp answer tax spend wast get peopl vote pay later end respons elect challeng labour say bring liber democrat leader charl kennedi attack mr brown fail mention environ record social justic right britain today poorest pay tax proport incom richest ask mr kennedi criticis mr brown fail mention tick bomb council tax revalu say high time system replac local tax base abil pay minut speech mr brown told mp defi pundit hit growth target say budget struck balanc tax cut afford invest essenti stabil paramount reject acrosstheboard tax cut favour target help famili child tax credit rise line earn give famili extra £ week contrast person incom tax allow rise line inflat £ £ next month mr brown told mp child benefit would rise maximum £ week first child £ two child despit giveaway budget document show mr brown claw back £m clampdown tax avoid increas revenu windfal tax oil compani also scrap stamp duti relief commerci properti disadvantag area measur brought three year ago bbc polit editor andrew marr suggest sweeten big enough transform effect voter trust mr brown econom stewardship would central elect issu say mr brown also unveil plan memori queen mother fund special coin celebr queen th birthday measur includ equal tax statu samesex coupl deal council mortgag lender boost low cost home ownership level peopl start pay inherit tax also rise £ £ april mr brown say met financi golden rule £bn surplu say public borrow would continu fall next five year economi grown consecut quarter say forecast continu next year forecast first £bn valueformoney save identifi gershon review achiev chancellor say civil servant post axe reloc south east england ad snp leader alex salmond say mr brown fail tartan test measur boost scottish economi simon thoma plaid cymru call budget middl england uk independ parti leader roger knapman attack plan pension say need money digniti allow spend want free bu ride green parti say budget wast opportun environment protect ad brown obvious eye come elect take eye need planet
350,340,russian ex-spy on hunger strike an ex-russian intelligence officer who risked his life spying for mi6 is entering the seventh week of a hunger strike near 10 downing street.  viktor makarov  50  claims he has been betrayed by the british authorities  who promised he would live like an  average british citizen . but despite a £65 000 settlement four years ago  he says he has been denied defector status and a decent pension. other ex-russian spies have been given civil service pensions.  hunger strike is a weapon of last resort. it can work only with determination and of course the realisation of the righteousness of your case - without that it will not work   mr makarov told the bbc s newsnight programme.  since i came to this country two batches of promises have been made and broken one after the other.   oleg gordievsky  a senior kgb officer who became a secret agent for the british  said he was  very happy  with the way the government have treated him since him since he defected in 1985. commenting on mr makarov s case  he said:  the british state is not a fat cow - it is impossible to come here and demand give me more money every week.  but mr makarov s case has been backed by david kahn - a former yale historian  and a leading expert on code-breaking  who has confirmed his information was valuable to the western allies.  i believe the government of the united kingdom  which in that respect was probably the same as most other power authorities - took the information that victor makarov had  wrung him dry and left him to hang out in the cold   mr kahn said.  mr makarov joined the kgb in 1970s russia  as an idealistic 20 year-old. one of his fellow pupils at intelligence school was vladimir putin. at kgb headquarters in moscow  he was posted to the secret 16th directorate - which decoded intercepted diplomatic traffic from the west. by the 1980s he had risen to the rank of senior lieutenant - and was privy to the thoughts of western powers. but he had became deeply disenchanted with the soviet regime - fuelled by its repression both at home and in poland.  through his english teacher  he made an approach to m16 - and then began passing secrets to the british intelligence service. he spied for mi6 for two years before being betrayed by a friend and sent to perm 35 - a soviet hard labour camp in the artic circle. within a week of his release in 1992  he made contact with the british authorities he d been spying for  who arranged a meeting between him and an mi6 agent in latvia. he was given a false passport  and he says  promised that he would be given the chance to live like an average uk citizen. but after arriving in london 13 years ago  he feels this promise has not been fulfilled. after long periods of living in bedsits  with deteriorating health  four years ago he took legal action against the government - and settled for £65 000 to buy a small house. but he says he will remain on hunger strike until he receives a decent pension and the right to work  something he feels he has been denied because the authorities do not trust him. government sources told the bbc they had reached a final settlement with the former spy  which he has been able to appeal to security and intelligence tribunals.,russian exspi hunger strike exrussian intellig offic risk life spi mi enter seventh week hunger strike near down street viktor makarov claim betray british author promis would live like averag british citizen despit £ settlement four year ago say deni defector statu decent pension exrussian spi give civil servic pension hunger strike weapon last resort work determin cours realis righteous case without work mr makarov told bbc newsnight programm sinc come countri two batch promis make broken one oleg gordievski senior kgb offic becam secret agent british say happi way govern treat sinc sinc defect comment mr makarov case say british state fat cow imposs come demand give money everi week mr makarov case back david kahn former yale historian lead expert codebreak confirm inform valuabl western alli believ govern unit kingdom respect probabl power author take inform victor makarov wrung dri left hang cold mr kahn say mr makarov join kgb s russia idealist yearold one fellow pupil intellig school vladimir putin kgb headquart moscow post secret th director decod intercept diplomat traffic west s risen rank senior lieuten privi thought western power becam deepli disench soviet regim fuell repress home poland english teacher make approach m begin pas secret british intellig servic spi mi two year betray friend sent perm soviet hard labour camp artic circl within week releas make contact british author spi arrang meet mi agent latvia give fals passport say promis would give chanc live like averag uk citizen arriv london year ago feel promis fulfil long period live bedsit deterior health four year ago take legal action govern settl £ buy small hous say remain hunger strike receiv decent pension right work someth feel deni author trust govern sourc told bbc reach final settlement former spi abl appeal secur intellig tribun

352,1610,a year to remember for irish there used to be one subliminal moment during a year in irish rugby that stood out more than most.  well  at least there used to one. now there is a handful to look back with a mixture of satisfaction  and sorrow. it has been quite a year for the irish  and not just with eddie o sullivan s triple crown winning international outfit either. right down through the ranks irish rugby is creating waves and upsetting the more established teams in the game. but most of the kudos will go to o sullivan and his merry band of warriors who not only collected their first triple crown for 29 years  but also finished their autumn campaign with a 100% record. for the second year in succession they also finished in the runners-up spot in the rbs six nations. but in the three games in november which included a victory over tri-nations champions and grand slam chasing south africa  ireland finsihed the year on a high. the 18-12 victory at lansdowne road was only their second victory over the boks after the initial success back in 1965. that success was revenge for the consecutive defeats in blomefontein and cape town in the summer. those two reverses and the 35-17 flop against france  were the only dark patches in an otherwise excellent 12 months. but the big one  of course  was the 19-13 defeat of world cup champions england on their precious twickenham turf. the winning try was conceived in o sullivan s mind  perfectly executed by the team and finished immaculately by girvan dempsey. for me  the try of the championship. o sullivan s career is now in vertical take-off mode. it is no wonder that sir clive woodward has elevated the galway-based coach to head the lions test side. not only that  but a fair majority of the present ireland side will be wearing red next june in new zealand.  there can be no doubt that ireland s representation will be the biggest ever  albeit in a proposed 44-man squad. in brian o driscoll and paul o connell  ireland have now the two front-runners for the captaincy. gordon d arcy  whose career began as a teenager back in 1999  finally arrived when he was named the six nations player of the tournament. but it was not only the senior squad that brought kudos to ireland  the youngsters strutted their stuff on the big stage as well. the under-21 squad confounded the doubters as they went all the way to the world cup final in scotland only to be beaten by a powerful all black side in the decider. the young irish boys had stated their intentions earlier in the season when they finished runners-up to england in the six nations under-21 tournament. on the provincial front  leinster  for second year in succession  blew it when the heineken cup looked a good wager. while ulster finished runners-up in their very tight group for the second season in succession  it was munster again flying the flag for the irish. looking to reach their third final  they went down 37-32 to eventual winners wasps in what many beileve was the most competitive and thunderous game ever witnessed at lansdowne road. how wasps recovered from that energy-sapping duel  and then go onto to defeat toulouse in the final was anybody s guess. ulster  meanwhile  just lost out to adding the inaugural celtic cup in winning the celtic league when they were pipped at the post by the scarlets in the final game.  ulster  however  took time to start the new season under new coach mark mccall. the once famous ravenhill fortress was breached four times as ulster only manged five wins from their first 12 outings in the celtic league. leinster are again looking the most potent outfit going into 2005  but whether they can take that final step under declan kidney is another thing. on the down side  irish rugby was hit by a number of tragedies. teenage star john mccall died while playing for the ireland against new zealand in the under-19 world cup game in durban. that happened only 10 days after he led royal armagh to their first ulster schools  cup success since 1977. the death of former ireland coach and lions flanker mike doyle in a car crash in northern ireland shocked the rugby fraternity a larger than life character  doyle had coached ireland to the triple crown in 1985  the last time that goal had been achieved before this season. ulster rugby also suffered the sudden deaths of well-known londonderry ym player jim huey  coleraine s jonathan hutchinson  and belfast harlequins lock johnny poole. they all passed away long before the full-time whistle.,year rememb irish use one sublimin moment year irish rugbi

357,441,lasers help bridge network gaps an indian telecommunications firm has turned to lasers to help it overcome the problems of setting up voice and data networks in the country.  tata teleservices is using the lasers to make the link between customers  offices and its own core network. the laser bridges work across distances up to 4km and can be set up much faster than cable connections. in 12 months the lasers have helped the firm set up networks in more than 700 locations.   in this particular geography getting permission to dig the ground and lay the pipes is a bit of a task   said mr r. sridharan  vice president of networks at tata.  heavy traffic and the layout under the ground mean that digging is uniquely difficult   he said. in some locations  he said  permission to dig up roads and lay cables was impossible to get. he said it was far easier to secure permission for putting networking hardware on roofs. this has led chennai-based tata to turn to equipment that uses lasers to make the final mile leap between tata s core network and the premises of customers. the lightpointe laser bridges work over distances of up to 4km and are being used to route both voice and data from businesses on to the backbone of the network. the hardware works in pairs and beam data through the air in the form of laser pulses.  the laser bridges can route data at speeds up to 1.25gbps (2 000 times faster than a 512kbps broadband connection) but tata is running its hardware at more modest speeds of 1-2mbps. the lasers are also ideal for india because of its climate.  it s particularly suitable as the rain rate is a little low and it s hardly ever foggy   he said. in places where rain is heavy and fog is common laser links can struggle to maintain good connection speeds. the laser links also take far less time to set up and get working  said mr sridharan.  once we get the other permissions  normal time period for set up is a few hours   he said. by contrast  he said  digging up roads and laying cables can take weeks or months. this speed of set up has helped tata with its aggressive expansion plans. just over 12 months ago the firm had customers in only about 70 towns and cities. but by the end of march the firm hopes to reach more than 1 000.  speed is very important because of the pace of competition   said mr sridharan.,laser help bridg network gap indian telecommun firm turn laser help overcom problem set voic data network countri tata teleservic use laser make link custom offic core network laser bridg work across distanc km set much faster cabl connect month laser help firm set network locat particular geographi get permiss dig ground lay pipe bit task say mr r sridharan vice presid network tata heavi traffic layout ground mean dig uniqu difficult say locat say permiss dig road lay cabl imposs get say far easy secur permiss put network hardwar roof lead chennaibas tata turn equip use laser make final mile leap tata core network premis custom lightpoint laser bridg work distanc km use rout voic data busi backbon network hardwar work pair beam data air form laser pul laser bridg rout data speed gbp time faster kbp broadband connect tata run hardwar modest speed mbp laser also ideal india climat particularli suitabl rain rate littl low hardli ever foggi say place rain heavi fog common laser link struggl maintain good connect speed laser link also take far less time set get work say mr sridharan get permiss normal time period set hour say contrast say dig road lay cabl take week month speed set help tata aggress expans plan month ago firm custom town citi end march firm hope reach speed import pace competit say mr sridharan
358,2086,mobile games come of age the bbc news website takes a look at how games on mobile phones are maturing. a brief round-up follows but you can skip straight to the reviews by clicking on the links below.  if you think of snake when some mentions  mobile games  then you could be in for a bit of a surprise. this is because mobile games have come a long way in a very short time. even before nokia s n-gage game phone launched in late 2003  many mobile operators were realising that there was an audience looking for something to play on their handset.  and given that many more people own handsets than own portable game playing gadgets such as the gameboy it could be a very lucrative market. that audience includes commuters wanting something to fill their time on the way home  game fans looking for a bit of variety and hard core gamers who like to play every moment they can. life for all these types of player has got immeasurably better in the last year as the numbers of titles you can download to your phone has snowballed. now sites such as wireless gaming review list more than 200 different titles for some uk networks and the ranges suit every possible taste. there are ports of pc and arcade classics such as space invaders  lunar lander and bejewelled. there are also versions of titles  such as colin mcrae rally  that you typically find on pcs and consoles.  there are shoot-em-ups  adventure games  strategy titles and many novel games only found on handsets. rarely now does an action movie launch without a mobile game tie-in. increasingly such launches are all part of the promotional campaign for a film  understandable when you realise that a good game can rack up millions of downloads. the returns can be pretty good when you consider that some games cost £5. what has also helped games on mobiles thrive is the fact that it is easier than ever to get hold of them thanks to technology known as wap push. by sending a text message to a game maker you can have the title downloaded to your handset. far better than having to navigate through the menus of most mobile operator portals. the number of handsets that can play games has grown hugely too. almost half of all phones now have java onboard meaning that they can play the increasingly sophisticated games that are available - even the ones that use 3d graphics.  the minimum technology specifications that phones should adhere to are getting more sophisticated which means that games are too. now double key presses are possible making familiar tactics such as moving and strafing a real option. the processing power on handsets means that physics on mobile games is getting more convincing and the graphics are improving too. some game makers are also starting to take advantage of the extra capabilities in a mobile. many titles  particularly racing games  let you upload your best time to see how you compare to others. usually you can get hold of their best time and race against a  ghost  or  shadow  to see if you can beat them. a few games also let you take on people in real time via the network or  if you are sitting close to them  via bluetooth short-range radio technology. with so much going on it is hard to do justice to the sheer diversity of what is happening. but these two features should help point you in the direction of the game makers and give you an idea of where to look and how to get playing.   too fast too furious (digital bridges)   as soon as i start playing this i remember why i never play driving games - because i m rubbish at them. no matter if i drive the car via joystick or keypad i just cannot get the hang of braking for corners or timing a rush to pass other drivers. the game rewards replay because to advance you have to complete every section within a time limit. winning gives you cash for upgrades. graphically the rolling road is a convincing enough evocation of speed as the palm trees and cactus whip by and the city scrolls past in the background. the cars handle pretty well despite my uselessness but it was not clear if the different models of cars were appreciably different on the track. the only niggle was that the interface was a bit confusing especially when using a joystick rather than the keypad to play.   fatal force (macrospace)   a futuristic shooter that lets you either play various deathmatch modes against your phone or run through a series of scenarios that involves killing aliens invading earth. graphics are a bit cartoon-like but only helps to make clear what is going on and levels are well laid out and encourage you to leap about exploring. both background music and sounds effects work well. the scenarios are well scripted and you regularly get hints from the fatal force commanders. weapons include flamethrowers  rocket launchers  grenades and at a couple of points you even get chance to use a mech for a short while. with the right power-up you can go into a matrix-style bullet time to cope with the onslaught of aliens. the game lets you play via bluetooth if others are in range. online the game has quite a following with clans  player rankings and even new downloadable maps.,mobil game come age bbc news websit take look game mobil phone matur brief roundup follow skip straight review click link think snake mention mobil game could bit surpris mobil game come long way short time even nokia ngage game phone launch late mani mobil oper realis audienc look someth play handset give mani peopl handset portabl game play gadget gameboy could lucr market audienc includ commut want someth fill time way home game fan look bit varieti hard core gamer like play everi moment life type player get immeasur well last year number titl download phone snowbal site wireless game review list differ titl uk network rang suit everi possibl tast port pc arcad classic space invad lunar lander bejewel also version titl colin mcrae ralli typic find pc consol shootemup adventur game strategi titl mani novel game found handset rare action movi launch without mobil game tiein increasingli launch part promot campaign film understand realis good game rack million download return pretti good consid game cost £ also help game mobil thrive fact easy ever get hold thank technolog know wap push send text messag game maker titl download handset far well navig menu mobil oper portal number handset play game grown huge almost half phone java onboard mean play increasingli sophist game avail even one use d graphic minimum technolog specif phone adher get sophist mean game doubl key press possibl make familiar tactic move strafe real option process power handset mean physic mobil game get convinc graphic improv game maker also start take advantag extra capabl mobil mani titl particularli race game let upload best time see compar other usual get hold best time race ghost shadow see beat game also let take peopl real time via network sit close via bluetooth shortrang radio technolog much go hard justic sheer diver happen two featur help point direct game maker give idea look get play fast furiou digit bridg soon start play rememb never play drive game rubbish matter drive car via joystick keypad get hang brake corner time rush pas driver game reward replay advanc complet everi section within time limit win give cash upgrad graphic roll road convinc enough evoc speed palm tree cactu whip citi scroll past background car handl pretti well despit useless clear differ model car appreci differ track niggl interfac bit confus especi use joystick rather keypad play fatal forc macrospac futurist shooter let either play variou deathmatch mode phone run seri scenario involv kill alien invad earth graphic bit cartoonlik help make clear go level well laid encourag leap explor background music sound effect work well scenario well script regularli get hint fatal forc command weapon includ flamethrow rocket launcher grenad coupl point even get chanc use mech short right powerup go matrixstyl bullet time cope onslaught alien game let play via bluetooth other rang onlin game quit follow clan player rank even new download map

360,661,uk needs tax cuts  tories insist a major change of direction is needed in britain if it is to prosper  the shadow chancellor said as the tory party spring conference began.  oliver letwin said the uk could not compete with other countries without the £4bn tax cuts he was promising. tory co-chairman liam fox had opened the forum in brighton with an attack on labour s record and party leader michael howard is due to speak later. tony blair has said conservative policies would cause economic failure. but mr letwin said britain had fallen from fourth to 11th in the international economic competitiveness league.   can this country compete  can this country prosper  unless we do something about the burden of regulation and tax on our economy   he said.  if we are going to take on the great challenges  the challenges like those posed by the chinese and the indians  we have got to do something about getting down the burden of regulation and getting down the burden of tax   he said.  the fact is the very carefully costed  fully funded plans we have laid out for saving £12bn by 2007-2008 are absolutely crucial to delivering an economy that will prosper and provide people with jobs and indeed provide the public services with the money they need on a sustainable long-term basis.  mr letwin said voting for labour meant choosing higher taxes  borrowing and waste.  earlier  dr fox had said labour s rule had been characterised by  lost trust and failure to deliver . he also attacked the government s  failure  to control immigration and asylum and criticised its record on the nhs  telling delegates labour cannot be trusted on education or crime. a tory government would sort out the  shambles  of immigration  put patients before statistics and bring discipline to schools  he said. michael howard  who had been due to welcome delegates to the conference on friday  will address them in a lunchtime speech. his welcome address had to be postponed after he stayed in london to lead the party s opposition to the prevention of terrorism bill in its lengthy progress through parliament. the bill was finally passed on friday evening  after more than 30 hours of debate. mr howard is likely to defend his party s handling of the bill  which was only passed after the conservatives accepted prime minister tony blair s promise that mps would be able to review it within a year.,uk need tax cut torus insist major chang direct need britain prosper shadow chancellor say torus parti spring confer begin oliv letwin say uk could compet countri without £bn tax cut promis torus cochairman liam fox open forum brighton attack labour record parti leader michael howard due speak later toni blair say conserv polici would caus econom failur mr letwin say britain fall fourth th intern econom competit leagu countri compet countri prosper unless someth burden regul tax economi say go take great challeng challeng like pose chine indian get someth get burden regul get burden tax say fact care cost fulli fund plan laid save £bn absolut crucial deliv economi prosper provid peopl job inde provid public servic money need sustain longterm basi mr letwin say vote labour meant choos high tax borrow wast earlier dr fox say labour rule characteris lose trust failur deliv also attack govern failur control immigr asylum criticis record nh tell deleg labour trust educ crime torus govern would sort shambl immigr put patient statist bring disciplin school say michael howard due welcom deleg confer friday address lunchtim speech welcom address postpon stay london lead parti opposit prevent terror bill lengthi progress parliament bill final pas friday even hour debat mr howard like defend parti handl bill pas conserv accept prime minist toni blair promis mp would abl review within year
361,1297,clarke to press on with id cards new home secretary charles clarke has vowed to plough on with plans for id cards despite a call for him to  pause for thought  from charles kennedy.  the lib dem leader said david blunkett s resignation was a  good opportunity  to question whether the legislation was necessary. but mr clarke said he had supported the plans when mr blunkett argued for them in cabinet and he supported them now.  id cards are a means to creating a more secure society   he said. mr clarke acknowledged how the measure was introduced remained a matter for debate but he said legislation had already been  significantly influenced  by the recommendations of the commons  home affairs committee.  the issue would be debated in parliament next monday as scheduled he insisted. earlier mr kennedy  whose party opposes the id cards plan as  deeply flawed  said with christmas coming up the new home secretary had time to think again. he told bbc radio 4 s today programme that mr clarke had been reported to be less enthusiastic about id cards than his predecessors.  wouldn t this be a good opportunity for a new home secretary  a new broom  to sweep clean in this respect and why do we need this legislation in the first place   he asked. earlier this week the tories announced they would back the government s plans although michael howard was forced to deny the shadow cabinet was split over its decision.  they had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror  crime and illegal immigration. among those reported to have serious reservations over the strategy were senior shadow cabinet members david davis  oliver letwin and tim yeo. the chairman of the bar council  guy mansfield qc has warned there is a real risk that people on the  margins of society  would be driven into the hands of extremists.  what is going to happen to young asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere  they are going to be stopped. if they haven t [id cards] they are going to be detained.   the home office says people will pay £85 for a passport and id card together or a undecided fee for a separate id card. the first cards would be issued in 2008 and when he was introducing the bill  mr blunkett suggested parliament could decide in 2011 or 2012 whether to make it compulsory for everybody to own the cards  although not to carry them. the new bill will also create new criminal offences on the possession of false identity documents. and there will be civil penalties including a fine of up to £1 000 fine for people who fail to say they have moved house or changed other details and of up to £2 500 for failing to sign up if the cards become compulsory. the scheme will be overseen by a new independent watchdog.,clark press id card new home secretari charl clark vow plough plan id card despit call paus thought charl kennedi lib dem leader say david blunkett resign good opportun question whether legisl necessari mr clark say support plan mr blunkett argu cabinet support id card mean creat secur societi say mr clark acknowledg measur introduc remain matter debat say legisl alreadi significantli influenc recommend common home affair committe issu would debat parliament next monday schedul insist earlier mr kennedi whose parti oppos id card plan deepli flaw say christma come new home secretari time think told bbc radio today programm mr clark report less enthusiast id card predecessor good opportun new home secretari new broom sweep clean respect need legisl first place ask earlier week torus announc would back govern plan although michael howard forc deni shadow cabinet split decis decid support plan polic say would help fight terror crime illeg immigr among report seriou reserv strategi senior shadow cabinet member david davi oliv letwin tim yeo chairman bar council guy mansfield qc warn real risk peopl margin societi would driven hand extremist go happen young asian men bomb go somewher go stop id card go detain home offic say peopl pay £ passport id card togeth undecid fee separ id card first card would issu introduc bill mr blunkett suggest parliament could decid whether make compulsori everybodi card although carri new bill also creat new crimin offenc posse fals ident document civil penalti includ fine £ fine peopl fail say move hous chang detail £ fail sign card becom compulsori scheme overseen new independ watchdog

367,1754,wembley firm won t make a profit shares in multiplex group  which is building the new wembley stadium  fell as much as 19% after it said it would not make any money on the project.  the australian firm said it would only break even on the 1.2bn australian dollars (£458m; $874m) rebuild  after a rise in costs on the work. any profits would depend on the outcome of legal cases resulting from a change in steel contractor  it added. it cut a$68m from profit targets for wembley and another uk project.  investors were shaken by the news and the firm s shares fell to a four month low of a$4.50  before recovering to close 16% down at a$4.67. the decline came despite multiplex reporting an 11% rise in pre-tax profits to a$67.7m for 2004 and reaffirming its 2005 profit forecasts. increased costs at wembley and a separate development in london s docklands saw multiplex s construction division report profits of a$35.1m.  the firm said the result was below expectations but stressed that the majority of its uk projects - which also include the white city redevelopment scheme in west london - were performing strongly.  to recoup any profit from wembley  where the firm changed its steel contractor due to a legal dispute  multiplex will have to win legal claims against subcontractors. these claims could take up to two years to resolve.  multiplex believes its claim are sound and ultimately will exceed the level needed to support the break even position   it said.  it is expected that profits will be possible in future periods as the claims are finalised.  wembley stadium is to due to be completed in january and will officially open for the 2006 fa cup final. analysts expressed concern at the unexpected paring back in profit.  such a big writeback on the wembley project in such a short period has impacted on management credibility   simon wheatley  from goldman sachs  told reuters.,wembley firm make profit share multiplex group build new wembley stadium fell much say would make money project australian firm say would break even bn australian dollar £m m rebuild rise cost work profit would depend outcom legal case result chang steel contractor ad cut be profit target wembley anoth uk project investor shaken news firm share fell four month low a recov close a declin come despit multiplex report rise pretax profit be reaffirm profit forecast increas cost wembley separ develop london dockland saw multiplex construct divis report profit be firm say result expect stress major uk project also includ white citi redevelop scheme west london perform strongli recoup profit wembley firm chang steel contractor due legal disput multiplex win legal claim subcontractor claim could take two year resolv multiplex believ claim sound ultim exceed level need support break even posit say expect profit possibl futur period claim finalis wembley stadium due complet januari offici open fa cup final analyst express concern unexpect pare back profit big writeback wembley project short period impact manag credibl simon wheatley goldman sach told reuter
368,132,film production  falls  40% in uk the number of british films produced in the uk fell 40% in 2004  with movies starring johnny depp and jude law among those affected  screen daily has said.  twenty-seven british films were made in the uk last year following a drop in funding  compared with 45 in 2003  according to the trade weekly. it attributed the drop to tighter tax laws and reduced funding from sources such as the national lottery. uk and us co-productions in britain fell from 102 in 2003 to 81 last year.  last year the government closed tax loopholes that many film investors had taken advantage of to fund films in the uk. several projects were shelved as they faced the implications of this clampdown  coupled with the reduction in movie funding from traditional sources including the lottery and miramax films. shooting on period drama tulip fever  which was to star jude law and keira knightley  was postponed indefinitely while shooting of the libertine starring johnny depp was moved to the isle of man.   there isn t anything coming in to replace (the funds)   said the libertine s executive producer marc samuelson.  we are in a hiatus.  films with  medium  budgets of up to £9m  a similar level to box office hits vera drake  calendar girls and enduring love  are expected to be worst hit by the tax clampdown. the strength of the pound against the dollar is expected to have resulted in a fall in the number of us films shot in the uk during 2004  screen international added. big budget co-productions  such as the harry potter series  continued to be shot in the uk  however. the uk film council said the drop was partly due to 2003 being an especially good year for british film production  when bridget jones: the edge of reason  wimbledon and thunderbirds were all filmed in the uk.   the drop was expected as there was no way 2003 s record level of production could be bettered   the council s spokesperson said.  the reduction in indigenous film production in 2004 was due to a variety of factors  including the continuing long-term trend towards co-production of films in more than one country and changes to financing arrangements.  it was  too early  to predict whether the downward trend in uk production would continue throughout 2005  the uk film council said. in september the government introduced subsidies worth up to £4m per film for medium budget films  under new treasury measures. it is also due to announce a replacement for uk film tax relief scheme section 48 in july.,film product fall uk number british film produc uk fell movi star johnni depp jude law among affect screen daili say twentyseven british film make uk last year follow drop fund compar accord trade weekli attribut drop tighter tax law reduc fund sourc nation lotteri uk u coproduct britain fell last year last year govern close tax loophol mani film investor take advantag fund film uk sever project shelv face implic clampdown coupl reduct movi fund tradit sourc includ lotteri miramax film shoot period drama tulip fever star jude law keira knightley postpon indefinit shoot libertin star johnni depp move isl man anyth come replac fund say libertin execut produc marc samuelson hiatu film medium budget £m similar level box offic hit vera drake calendar girl endur love expect bad hit tax clampdown strength pound dollar expect result fall number u film shot uk screen intern ad big budget coproduct harri potter seri continu shot uk howev uk film council say drop partli due especi good year british film product bridget jone edg reason wimbledon thunderbird film uk drop expect way record level product could well council spokesperson say reduct indigen film product due varieti factor includ continu longterm trend toward coproduct film one countri chang financ arrang earli predict whether downward trend uk product would continu throughout uk film council say septemb govern introduc subsidi worth £m per film medium budget film new treasuri measur also due announc replac uk film tax relief scheme section juli
369,1209,blair looks to election campaign tony blair s big speech will be looked back on as the performance that kicked off the election campaign.  that poll may still be about 16 weeks away  but there can be little doubt left that the campaign is now in full swing. the prime minister used his speech to a selected audience in the south east to set out his broad brush election manifesto. there was a detailed account of the government s past record  with a major emphasis on the economy and public services. there was an attempt to draw the line under the gossip surrounding his rift with chancellor gordon brown. and there was an insistence on the importance of the party continuing to operate as unremittingly  new  labour - although that may continue to irritate his chancellor.  there was little in terms of concrete proposals or what might form manifesto pledges  although the prime minister talked about a  new labour manifesto that will be aimed at all sections of society . his was more a speech designed to remind people  and some in his own party  precisely what new labour stood for  and to leave them in no doubt there would not be any shrinking away from that approach. and  for some  that means showing that new labour actually does stand for something - that it is  as he said  more than  an electoral device .  to that end he set out a broad programme aimed to appeal to both middle england voters who switched to the party in 1997 and stuck with it  possibly through some gritted teeth  in 2001  and to more traditional lower income old labour supporters. in a key section  he declared:  in our third term we can achieve an unprecedented widening of opportunity and prosperity.  for the first time ever a whole generation growing up with unbroken economic stability. every family - not just the fortunate few - knowing their children will have an inheritance at adulthood.  every pupil in every secondary school guaranteed a place in university or a quality apprenticeship. every adult - including those who missed out at school - able to get the skills then need to advance.  home ownership extended to its highest ever level and to families who have never before been able to afford it.  the highest ever level of employment with everyone in work guaranteed a decent wage and decent conditions .  under what is to be the general election slogan  britain is working   the prime minister time and again insisted the future direction would be unremittingly new labour. that might get under the skin of mr brown  but he also heaped praise on him as the most successful post-war chancellor britain has had. probably the greatest ideological divide between the two men  in so far as there is one  is about the degree of private finance allowed into the public services.  an unremittingly  new  labour manifesto  as the prime minister is happy to make plain  will stress the importance of that - the belief patients and parents  for example  want a choice of good services before they start worrying about who has provided them. the chancellor is said to be far more sceptical about private finance  although there is no suggestion he opposes it in principle. with an election looming the next big speech from gordon brown will be closely examined for any signs of divisions and  in particular  the use of that little three letter word. but for now  all eyes have been focused on the next general election. and for many in westminster  mr blair s performance has only succeeded in hardening the belief that will be on 5 may.,blair look elect campaign toni blair big speech look back perform kick elect campaign poll may still week away littl doubt left campaign full swing prime minist use speech select audienc south east set broad brush elect manifesto detail account govern past record major emphasi economi public servic attempt draw line gossip surround rift chancellor gordon brown insist import parti continu oper unremittingli new labour although may continu irrit chancellor littl term concret propos might form manifesto pledg although prime minist talk new labour manifesto aim section societi speech design remind peopl parti precis new labour stood leav doubt would shrink away approach mean show new labour actual stand someth say elector devic end set broad programm aim appeal middl england voter switch parti stuck possibl grit teeth tradit low incom old labour support key section declar third term achiev unpreced widen opportun prosper first time ever whole gener grow unbroken econom stabil everi famili fortun know child inherit adulthood everi pupil everi secondari school guarante place univers qualiti apprenticeship everi adult includ miss school abl get skill need advanc home ownership extend high ever level famili never abl afford high ever level employ everyon work guarante decent wage decent condit gener elect slogan britain work prime minist time insist futur direct would unremittingli new labour might get skin mr brown also heap prais success postwar chancellor britain probabl great ideolog divid two men far one degre privat financ allow public servic unremittingli new labour manifesto prime minist happi make plain stress import belief patient parent exampl want choic good servic start worri provid chancellor say far sceptic privat financ although suggest oppos principl elect loom next big speech gordon brown close examin sign divis particular use littl three letter word eye focus next gener elect mani westminst mr blair perform succeed harden belief may

372,2224,how political squabbles snowball it s become commonplace to argue that blair and brown are like squabbling school kids and that they (and their supporters) need to grow up and stop bickering.  but this analysis in fact gets it wrong. it s not just children who fight - adults do too. and there are solid reasons why even a trivial argument between mature protagonists can be hard to stop once its got going. the key feature of an endless feud is that everyone can agree they d be better off if it ended - but everyone wants to have the last word.  each participant genuinely wants the row to stop  but thinks it worth prolonging the argument just a tiny bit to ensure their view is heard. their successive attempts to end the argument with their last word ensure the argument goes on and on and on. (in the case of mr blair and mr brown  successive books are published  ensuring the issues never die.) now this isn t because the participants are stupid - it s actually each individual behaving entirely rationally  given the incentives facing them. indeed  there s even a piece of economic theory that explains all this. nothing as obscure as  post-neo-classical endogenous growth theory  which the chancellor himself once quoted - but a ubiquitous piece of game theory which all respectable policy wonks are familiar with.  it s often referred to as the  prisoner s dilemma   based on a parable much told in economics degree courses... about a sheriff and two prisoners. the story goes that two prisoners are jointly charged with a heinous crime  and are locked up in separate cells. but the sheriff desperately needs a confession from at least one of them  to provide enough evidence to convict them of the crime. without a confession  the prisoners will get a minimal sentence on some trumped up charge.  clearly the prisoners  best strategy is to keep their mouths shut  and take the short sentence  but the clever sheriff has an idea to induce them to talk. he tells each prisoner separately  that if they confess - and they are the only one to confess - they ll be let off their crime. and he tells them that if they don t confess - and they are the only one not to confess - they ll get life. now  if you are prisoner confronted with this choice  your best bet is to confess. if your partner doesn t confess  you ll get off completely. and if your partner does confess  you d better confess to ensure you don t get life. the result is of course  both prisoners confess  so the sheriff does not have to let either one off. both prisoners  individual logic was to behave that way  even though both would have been better if they had somehow agreed to shut up. don t worry if you don t entirely follow it - you can to look it up on google  where there are 283 000 entries on it.  the prisoners  dilemma and all its ramifications have truly captured economists in the last couple of decades. it is a parable used to describe any situation where there is an obvious sensible choice to be taken collectively  but where the only rational choice individually is to behave selfishly.  a cold war arms race for example - a classic case where both russia and america would be better off with just a few arms  rather than a lot of arms. but as long as each wants just a few more arms than the other  an arms race ensues with the results that the individually logical decision to buy more arms  results in arms levels that are too high. what economics tells us is that once you re in a prisoners  dilemma - unless you are repeating the experience many times over - it s hard to escape the perverse logic of it. it s no good just exhorting people to stop buying arms  or to stop arguing when all their incentives encourage them to carry on. somehow  the incentives have to change.  in the case of the labour party  if you believe the rift between blair and brown camps is as bad as the reports suggest  solomon s wisdom needs to be deployed to solve the problem. every parent knows there are ingenious solutions to arguments  solutions which affect the incentives of the participants. an example  is the famous rule that  one divides  the other chooses  as a way of allocating a piece of cake to be sliced up between greedy children. in the case of an apparently endless argument  if you want it to come to an end  you have to ensure the person who has the last word is one who loses rather than the one who wins the row. the cost of prolonging the row by even one more briefing  or one more book for that matter  has to exceed the benefit of having the last word  and getting your point in. if the rest of the party can enforce that  they ll have the protagonists retreating pretty quickly.,polit squabbl snowbal becom commonplac argu blair brown like squabbl school kid support need grow stop bicker analysi fact get wrong child fight adult solid reason even trivial argument matur protagonist hard stop get go key featur endless feud everyon agre well end everyon want last word particip genuin want row stop think worth prolong argument tini bit ensur view heard success attempt end argument last word ensur argument goe case mr blair mr brown success book publish ensur issu never die particip stupid actual individu behav entir ration give incent face inde even piec econom theori explain noth obscur postneoclass endogen growth theori chancellor quot ubiquit piec game theori respect polici wonk familiar often refer prison dilemma base parabl much told econom degre cours sheriff two prison stori goe two prison jointli charg heinou crime lock separ cell sheriff desper need confess least one provid enough evid convict crime without confess prison get minim sentenc trump charg clearli prison best strategi keep mouth shut take short sentenc clever sheriff idea induc talk tell prison separ confess one confess let crime tell confess one confess get life prison confront choic best bet confess partner confess get complet partner confess well confess ensur get life result cours prison confess sheriff let either one prison individu logic behav way even though would well somehow agre shut worri entir follow look googl entri prison dilemma ramif truli captur economist last coupl decad parabl use describ situat obviou sensibl choic take collect ration choic individu behav selfishli cold war arm race exampl classic case russia america would well arm rather lot arm long want arm arm race ensu result individu logic decis buy arm result arm level high econom tell u prison dilemma unless repeat experi mani time hard escap pervers logic good exhort peopl stop buy arm stop argu incent encourag carri somehow incent chang case labour parti believ rift blair brown camp bad report suggest solomon wisdom need deploy solv problem everi parent know ingeni solut argument solut affect incent particip exampl famou rule one divid choos way alloc piec cake slice greedi child case appar endless argument want come end ensur person last word one lose rather one win row cost prolong row even one brief one book matter exceed benefit last word get point rest parti enforc protagonist retreat pretti quickli
